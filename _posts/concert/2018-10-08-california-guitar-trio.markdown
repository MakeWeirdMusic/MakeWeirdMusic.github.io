## Toccata and Fugue

The California Guitar Trio is renowned for their ability to do "circulations," where they pass notes from one player to another. Their use of circulations is on full display in this amazing three-guitar arrangement of J. S. *Bach's Toccata and Fugue*.

Here's the California Guitar Trio and the Montreal Guitar Trio performing Radiohead's *Weird Fishes*. It's a beautiful arrangement with an emotional vocal performance from Glenn Lévesque.
