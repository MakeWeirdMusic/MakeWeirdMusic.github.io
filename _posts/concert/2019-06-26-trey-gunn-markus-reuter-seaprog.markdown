I flew out to Seattle to spend some time with [Steve Ball](/discover/steve-ball) and several others for [SeaProg 2019](http://seaprogfest.org/). It was a great time and I was able to film a few shows. Here is one of them. Here are Trey Gunn (ex-King Crimson) and Markus Reuter (Stick Men) performing a largely improvised set over some pre-composed motifs.
