## Aspirations

This is one of my favorite Gentle Giant songs and I was incredibly honored to be asked to join such tremendous musicians on stage for this performance. Never in my wildest dreams did I think I'd have an opportunity like this. Gary Green was a guitar hero for me growing up, and to look over to make eye contact while performing music with him is just indescribable.

This was performed live in October 2017 in Albuquerque, New Mexico for the 2017 [GORGG](https://gorgg.org).
