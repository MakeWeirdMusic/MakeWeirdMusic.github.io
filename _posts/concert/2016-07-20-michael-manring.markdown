## CONCERT TRAILER

<div class="video-wrapper"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hB6-ZtZh-pc?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

I'm so excited about this, I don't even know what to say! I'll let this trailer speak for itself. In case you couldn't tell, this concert is available for purchase via YouTube for $20. Michael gets a large share of the revenue and MWM keeps a little so we can keep making this kind of content.

## SPECIAL THANKS

Thanks so much to Ken Coffman from [Stairway Press&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square"></i>](http://stairwaypress.com/) for sponsoring this concert!

And thanks so much to [Michael Nitro&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square"></i>](http://michaelnitro.com) for his lighting crew and equipment. He's a huge reason the concert looks so great.

And thanks so much to [Andy West](/interview/andy-west) for lending us all his gear so we could do this concert. And for helping to move furniture out of my living and dining rooms (along with another good friend, [Cory Berg&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square"></i>](http://softwareplusplus.com)).

And thanks so much to the 35-40 people who attended and made this such a special event, and then donated to MWM. So many wonderful people supporting the arts and fantastic and creative music.

## PROMO FOOTAGE

Michael and I thought it would be cool to take a chunk of the concert and offer it for free, so here's about 18 minutes of free footage that will hopefully entice you to purchase a copy of the rest of the concert.

Apart from the opening improv piece, Michael's cover of [*You Send Me*&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square"></i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Send_Me) in this video is my favorite part of the concert. And his performance of the [Dixie Dregs&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square"></i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dixie_Dregs)' *What If* with the Dregs' own Andy West is a real treat!

## Some Context

Back in the early 2000s, my friend [Bob Mendelsohn&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square"></i>](http://damprabbit.com) posted some videos of Michael playing at NAMM and I just fell in love with Michael's playing. I signed up for his mailing list and waited anxiously for him to come to Phoenix, AZ to perform. In 16 years, he never did! So, [when I interviewed him](/interview/michael-manring), I asked him if he'd ever be up for a house concert. He said he would and I resolved to find a way to fly him out and perform at my house.

Hosting this house concert was a dream come true and Ken Coffman made it all possible financially. I am deeply indebted to him.

I hope you really enjoy this concert because I have another concert planned in November with another special guest!
