## Studio Grand Opening Concert

For those of you who follow our activities closely, you'll know from social media that I've been building a new video studio in my backyard to accommodate all the MWM work, as well as making a space for doing my day job remotely. It's been an exhausting (and sometimes fun) project, but it's finally "done." Well, it's done enough to be usable. And to commemorate the grand opening of the studio, I invited the band [Evil Genius](/discover/evil-genius) out to my house and they performed a show! Super cool!

Here's one of the songs I requested, called *Colonel Karl Marx and Keenan McCardell* from their excellent new album [*Experiments on Human Subjects*&nbsp;<i class="fab fa-bandcamp"></i>](https://evilgeniustrio.bandcamp.com).

Oh, and until I do a final video about the studio, here's a little about the project while I was working on it:
