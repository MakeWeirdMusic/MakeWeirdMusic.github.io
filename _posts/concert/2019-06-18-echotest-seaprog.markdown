I flew out to Seattle to spend some time with [Steve Ball](/discover/steve-ball) and several others for [SeaProg 2019](http://seaprogfest.org/). It was a great time and I was able to film a few shows. Here is one of them. This is EchoTest featuring [Julie Slick](/discover/julie-slick) (bass), [Marcho Machera](/discover/marco-machera) (bass and vocals), and Alessandro Inolti (drums) performing a majority of their latest release, [Daughter of Ocean](https://julieslick.bandcamp.com/album/daughter-of-ocean).
