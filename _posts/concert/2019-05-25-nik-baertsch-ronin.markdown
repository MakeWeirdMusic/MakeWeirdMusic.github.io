A few years ago when I started listening to Nik Baertsch, I thought I'd never have the chance to see him perform live. And then the unexpected happened: my generous friend [Ken Coffman](http://stairwaypress.com) sponsored not only [a solo piano concert](/concert/nik-baertsch), but just a few months later he sponsored Nik and his entire zen funk band, RONIN, to perform in Apache Junction, AZ on March 21, 2019.

I would have filmed and recorded this show myself, but I was part of the opening act. Maybe there will be video of that some time in the future.

Anyway, I hope you enjoy this performance of *Modul 60* from RONIN's album *Awase*. You can buy *Awase* on [Nik's online shop](http://www.nikbaertsch.com/shop/).
