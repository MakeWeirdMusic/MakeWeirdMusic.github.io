## A Friendly Disclaimer

The following interview content with [Kerry Minnear&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square"></i>](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerry_Minnear) of Gentle Giant is in a pretty different format than you might expect because of the nature of how Kerry and I met and conducted an informal interview over the weekend of October 3, 2015. It was not filmed, no audio was captured, and it was completely impromptu. This may seem less like an interview than any other interview you’ve ever read; however, I’ve never claimed to be a journalist, nor even a storyteller. I can assure you I will do my best here to describe the experience I had talking at great length with Kerry.

This is a long-form article because it is such a personal story and I’m writing this as I’m coming off a bit of a high from the events that have taken place just hours ago.

## BACKGROUND

[Gentle Giant](/discover/gentle-giant) is a band very, very close to my heart. Their music was food for my soul when I was growing up. From contrapuntal multi-part vocal pieces like [*Knots*&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square"></i>](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/knots/id693527786?i=693527910) and [*On Reflection*&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square"></i>](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/on-reflection/id731948334?i=731948404), to atonal power rock like [*Proclamation*&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square"></i>](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/proclamation/id731975200?i=731975215) and [*Advent of Panurge*&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square"></i>](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-advent-of-panurge/id693527786?i=693527787), to beautiful ballads like [*Think of Me With Kindness*&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square"></i>](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/think-of-me-with-kindness/id693527786?i=693527913) and [*A Reunion*&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square"></i>](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/a-reunion/id731938339?i=731938362), there is seemingly no end to the breadth and depth of their music. There is a sweet mix of nostalgia, awe, and mystery for me when I think of these (and other) GG songs and the musicians behind them.

Most of their music was written by [Ray Shulman&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square"></i>](http://www.blazemonger.com/GG/Ray_Shulman), [Derek Shulman&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square"></i>](http://www.blazemonger.com/GG/Derek_Shulman), and [Kerry Minnear&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square"></i>](http://www.blazemonger.com/GG/Kerry_Minnear), which made these guys heroes to me. As a guitarist, I have paid particular attention to how [Gary Green&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square"></i>](http://www.blazemonger.com/GG/Gary_Green) contributed electric guitar parts to this music, even when it seemed juxtaposed or anachronistic amidst medieval and baroque moments sprinkled throughout GG’s diverse musical portfolio.

Many of my musical influences have also listed Gentle Giant as a significant influence. [Mike Keneally](/discover/mike-keneally) called them out specifically in [our interview with him](/interview/mike-keneally) as he spent an entire summer learning every GG guitar (and probably keyboard) part he could. Many friends and family musicians have spent hours talking about GG’s music with me and the influence the group has had on them. All this to say: GG is a non-trivial part of my life.

## GORGG

It turns out that GG is a non-trivial part of many other people’s lives as well! This summer, I received an email from an Israeli guitarist named Yehuda about our mutual efforts in fighting our way through playing the [King Crimson](/discover/king-crimson) piece, [*Fracture*&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square"></i>](/learn/fracture). After a few months of back-and-forth communication, he asked me if I listened to Gentle Giant, to which I emphatically replied, “Yes!” Then he informed me that he’s an organizer of an event called [GORGG&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square"></i>](http://gorgg.org) [Global On-Reflection Giant Gathering], which is an annual gathering of the [GG mailing list&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square"></i>](http://www.blazemonger.com/GG/On-Reflection_mailing_list) members, including original GG members Kerry Minnear, Gary Green, and [Malcolm Mortimore&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square"></i>](http://www.blazemonger.com/GG/Malcolm_Mortimore). He said, “Consider yourself invited,” and I immediately booked my travel.

I made some custom gift boxes as a token of appreciation for Gary and Kerry. The boxes contained a handwritten card, an Amazon gift card, and a USB flash drive containing videos of the [Steve Vai interview](/interview/steve-vai), [Mike Keneally interview](/interview/mike-keneally), [*Harnch* for 4 guitars](/share/harnch), and several GG-inspired songs I’d released (namely [*Pune*&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square"></i>](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/pune-feat.-jake-ineck/id561140550?i=561140751) and [*God Rest Ye Merry, Gentle Giant*&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square"></i>](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/god-rest-ye-merry-gentle-giant/id584043305)).

!CUSTOM GIFT BOXES

## What Have I Gotten Myself Into?

The insanity of doing all this didn’t hit me until a couple days before I had to fly to Montreal for GORGG. “I’m going to spend money I don’t want to spend to fly to a place I’ve never been to meet a bunch of people I don’t know based on an email invitation from another guy I’ve never met who lives on the other side of the planet.” The idea of traveling to new places is exciting to many people, but not me. I’m what you might call a “homebody.” I don’t speak French, I don’t like flying, and I’m uncomfortable traveling without a business purpose or without my wife.

The only guarantee I had of a good time was a ticket to see [Three Friends&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square"></i>](http://www.blazemonger.com/GG/Three_Friends_(band)), a GG tribute band consisting of Gary Green, Malcolm Mortimore, and several other talented musicians who’ve formed to perform music by Gentle Giant. My flight landed at 5PM on Saturday, October 3, and I had to check in to my hotel and get to the venue by 7PM–or was it 8PM? The concert ticket email (written in French) had both times listed. It was a hectic evening made a little more stressful by an unexpected traffic jam on the freeway as the bus was heading from the airport to downtown Montreal.

## Three Friends Concert

The concert venue doors opened at 7PM and I waited an hour amongst people (primarily speaking French) all of whom seemed to have a buddy to hang with. I hadn’t felt so lonely in quite some time.

The opening act, [The Moulettes&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square"></i>](http://www.moulettes.co.uk/), blew me away (more on that in another post coming soon) and Three Friends performed. Three Friends were great, too! I’d never seen/heard Gentle Giant music performed live, so it was a real treat to get ~2 hours of it amongst ~1,200 enthusiastic fans. At some point during the show, I saw Kerry Minnear sitting about 10 seats to my right and my stomach clenched in nervous excitement. “He’s here! He’s really here!” I had no idea at this time how this would be the very tip of the iceberg in terms of my interaction with him over the course of the next two days.

After the show, I saw a guy with a GORGG shirt and introduced myself. He said to meet in the “hospitality room” at the hotel after the show. I didn’t know where that really was and I was pretty exhausted from traveling all day, so I just went back to my hotel and got some much-needed rest.

## Meeting Gary Green

In the morning, I found the hospitality room. No one was there. I waited in the lobby until I saw a guy wearing a Gentle Giant shirt. He was a college-grad filmmaker named Morgan Miller who made a great music video based on Free Hand.

MORGAN'S FILM

Pretty funny.

Soon, I met a few other super-friendly people (namely Marc, AKA “No More Phil”) and then Gary Green and his wife. I nervously pulled the gift box from my jacket pocket, thanking him as he opened it up. He was touched and gave me a big hug, thanking me for the gift. It was so welcoming! Then someone suggested we get a picture together.

!Me and Gary

We had a nice conversation and then went our separate ways for a morning activity and lunch. I went with Marc, Dave (AKA “twosheds”), and his wife, Karen, to a pub to watch a soccer game on TV. Then we went to a small coffee shop to see The Moulettes play again, where Malcolm kindly introduced himself and Kerry ended up sitting down at the same table as me. Feeling slightly overwhelmed, I gave Kerry the gift box and he put it in his pocket, thanking me quietly. About 15 other GORGG attendees filed in over time. The place was packed.

## Meeting Kerry Minnear

After The Moulettes slayed us all with a wonderful acoustic set, approximately 20 GORGG people left to find a pub. Drinking is a frequent activity at GORGG. On the way to the pub, I saw Kerry looking around calling my name.

“Antony? Antony?” (This is how British people say my name.)

“Yes?” I replied.

“Thank you so, so much for the gift. I am deeply moved and would love to do an interview.”

“Wow, thank you, Kerry!”

“Here’s the thing, I don’t like being filmed and broadcast on YouTube, so can we do it informally? And what do you want to talk about? I’m a pretty boring interview.”

“Hah, I doubt that!” I said. “I’m asking people questions about creativity, motivation, finding their own unique voice, composition, and those kinds of things. It’s a way for me to learn myself as I do these interviews.”

“Oh, wonderful. I should be able to answer those questions. But, can we just do the interview now, instead? While we’re walking? I’m probably only good for about 20 or 30 minutes of conversation.”

“Sure!”

He then introduced me to his wife, who also thanked me for the gift. I was astounded at their humility and down-to-earth nature.

Kerry and I ended up talking for ~90 minutes about a variety of subjects. I’ll try to recount them here as best I can. I did not expect to do an ad-hoc interview and had brought a suitcase full of video, audio, and lighting equipment just in case either Gary or Kerry found the time to do an interview.

## Interview Summary

Keep in mind that this interview was not recorded and is not a direct transcript in any way. What I've written below is a best-attempt at capturing Kerry's words by memory on my flight back home from Montreal.

I’d consider it a recounting of events and conversation, at best. He is a man of Christian faith and is humble beyond description. He specifically doesn’t want to be “quoted” or committed to a misspoken statement. So, I will do my best to summarize what we talked about and try to recall what he said as he said it in a way that synthesizes a lot of our casual conversation.

## What Happened After Gentle Giant?

>After Gentle Giant disbanded in 1980, everyone went their separate ways. Ray [Shulman] went on to make techno music and did well with that. He used the pseudonym of "Head Doctor" and was part of a larger crowd of floating musicians doing these sort of techno releases for discos and clubs. He then went on to do video and DVD work, like building interactive menus and assembling DVD content for Marillion, Queen, and some Hollywood stuff. He’s done all the artwork and video stuff for our recent releases, too, like [*The Power and the Glory* remix DVD&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square"></i>](https://www.burningshed.com/store/gentlegiant/product/522/5784/) and the new [*Octopus* remix DVD&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square"></i>](https://www.burningshed.com/store/gentlegiant/product/522/6951/). He and I promised to work together on some collaborative material, but neither of us was terribly impressed with the other’s ideas. That kind of fell flat. That was a few years ago.
>
>Derek went on to work in the music business. He was always the business person behind Gentle Giant, which was great for us and difficult in some ways. He managed our salaries, helped to use record company advances effectively, which were effectively loans and not salary payments from the record company. This was great because it reduced our taxes in that the advances were like loans that we had to pay off in terms of recouping of costs. The record company would give us a sizable advance and Derek would split it up so we could all live off it for a decent amount of time. Then we would also have money left over to go record our music in the studio. As this was more of a loan that we had to payoff through record sales, we were basically off the hook in terms of paying taxes on the “income,” which made life a lot easier.
>
>Another great thing about Derek managing the financial affairs was that when he wanted a raise, he would make sure we all got raises, so none of us would have to ask for more money. Derek still retains a lot of the creative control over the band and its product and my wife does all the bookkeeping and paperwork mostly as a favor. It’s a job no one else would possibly want and I don’t know what we will do if something were to happen to her. I know I’m not going to do it and Gary’s definitely not going to, either.
>
>As for me, I wanted to use my musical capabilities for something greater than the rock band performance context. Between 1980 and 1985, I worked with a pastor leading a Christian revival movement who was working throughout England. He came by and saw my studio and was stunned to meet another Christian who had all this equipment and was willing to offer it for the purpose of the ministry.
>
>We worked together and went to churches all over England across various denominations, although I don’t think we entered any Catholic churches, which is a real shame because the Catholics had been responsible for the last major revival throughout England some time ago. I mostly lived off of royalties and “love gifts” from other believers who contributed to the cause.
>
>In 1985, we couldn’t afford to live that way anymore. We had young children who needed a proper upbringing, so I got a job teaching music to children. I never really told anyone about my work with Giant, although a couple students did find out and we had fun talking about that. But, I didn't use my experience with Giant to get ahead except for one job where it was relevant to have experience with percussion arrangements and bandleading. Teaching children was just wonderful except when I had students that did not practice or put the time in that was required.
>
>We were living in Cornwall for some time until my wife said she didn’t like the isolation of living there. It’s a beautiful, wonderful place with some difficult weather conditions and it’s fairly disconnected from the rest of society, which I loved but she didn’t. There’s a lovely trail along the cliffs that I loved to walk. That town is where the show [*Doc Martin*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Martin) was filmed.
>
>We ended up moving to the midlands into a dreadful area near Birmingham and we’ve been there since. Neither of us like it very much, but our parents are nearby and our children are all there. We are very active in our church there and the kids and I played there together for many years.

## What Are You Up To Lately?

>I retired a couple years ago and my wife also retired, so we have been spending a lot of time at home, helping our children out with their lives and taking care of our parents. It’s an ordinary life, really. We have a couple grandchildren and we get to see them often.
>
>As far as music, I play very regularly at church. I play a lot of guitar now, and some bass, with some drums as needed. Our church is about 100 people with 4 drummers (not at the same time like King Crimson), so I don’t play drums very much. A couple of them are quite good. For the most part, I volunteer and participate where I am needed. I fill the gaps.
>
>Speaking of King Crimson, they were the first rock band I ever really heard. They had amps and electric instruments and made all sorts of raucous noise! It was wonderful!
>
>I don’t like leading the church band or choosing the music because I’m too picky. If I get music from someone else, I just play it to the best of my ability and try to create an environment where people can experience and meet God. There can be a fine line when playing some of the pad patches because it can almost feel manipulative playing certain chords and picking bass notes that have real resonance and impact on people. But, I do what I can and serve honestly.

## Are You Writing Any New Music?

>In terms of composing, I’ve been in a bit of a dry spell and I’m working through that. It has been the cause of some anxiety because I know what I used to do with Giant and that work set a personal expectation of a standard for my music. Perhaps I am a different person now or I’ve evolved. I am still looking for that person inside of me. Nowadays, I start to compose and I don’t seem to have any ideas that really pull me in and show real cause for mental investment. If it isn’t worth the investment, I don’t find much reason to do anything but scrap it. It isn’t very good, even according to my friends!
>
>I am usually composing on the piano when I do try to compose. Sometimes I’ll just play some chord progressions and let a finger or two wander and do what they wish, but nothing in the past couple of years has really been fruitful. It’s been a challenge for me.
>
>One of my daughters is involved in [Lord of the Dance&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square"></i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_of_the_Dance_(musical)), the [Michael Flatley&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square"></i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Flatley) thing, and she gets to do some lovely Celtic singing. And my other daughter is singing in another band. I thought it would be nice to be able to write some nice contrapuntal songs that the three of us could perform together, so I promised myself and them that I would write some stuff in my retirement, but it just hasn’t gone anywhere.
>
>I have a studio upstairs in the loft at home and a way of recording the piano downstairs. Most ideas start at the piano and if there’s anything worth investing in, I’ll take that idea to the computer upstairs where the rest of the instruments are. It's not a very convenient workflow. Perhaps that has affected my lack of productivity as well.
>
>I still have my old white cello, though the bow is broken and the instrument is quite beat up after someone borrowed it. I’ve got my Tokai Stratocaster copy, which I got very cheap for 80 quid somewhere, and I would love to upgrade, but I really dislike the instrument shopping experience. I’ll try a strat or a tele in the store and bring my Tokai to compare with the new guitar and say, “No, this isn’t as nice as my Tokai.” Those guitars are looked upon favorably in the market, it seems.
>
>Most of my gear is pretty low end and my son’s band has much nicer equipment than I do, which is something I probably need to change. I’m looking at getting some new gear, like a better Strat, maybe a Tele, and an Avid Eleven Rack.

## What do you listen to for inspiration?

>I love a lot of the early church music, such as [William Byrd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Byrd). I am a big fan of [Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach), but he is sometimes too constrained by the rules of music theory and harmony. The ways he always returns to "home" are limits I like to break. I like a lot of choral music. A friend here at GORGG just gave me a CD of [Gabriel Faure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Faur%C3%A9)’s piano quintets, which should be nice as I'm already familiar with several of Faure's works. I don’t care much for modern pop music or much of the church music nowadays. The choruses of the songs just aren't terribly interesting.

## Interesting Tidbits

Kerry also shared several interesting facts about his life that I thought would be worth noting:

- He owned a [Lotus Super Seven Series 4&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square"></i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_Seven) (I have always wanted a Super 7 and even owned a kit for a replica!)
- *Knots* was not written on paper. They recorded it one layer at a time in the studio under Kerry's guidance.
- He once went to play [*Experience*&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square"></i>](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/experience/id731938339?i=731938359) on a [Mighty Wurlitzer organ&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square"></i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wurlitzer) wearing a black cape and got stuck in the organ pit when the power went out just before performing.
- While driving the tour bus through Arizona, he slammed on the brakes upon seeing a [roadrunner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadrunner) crossing the road, which woke up the entire band and he was so excited to tell them what he'd seen.

## Wrap-Up

Kerry and I spent many hours getting to know each other personally that weekend. I could not believe what a kindred spirit I'd found in him and I feel that we have developed a new friendship that I hope will endure for years to come. I am so grateful for the experience I had at GORGG and the open arms with which everyone welcomed me. What a great community! Next year's GORGG can't come soon enough...
