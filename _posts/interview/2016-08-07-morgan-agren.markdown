## Some Context

When I was a teenager, I bought a copy of [Zappa's Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zappa%27s_Universe) on VHS in my obsession to buy everything I could with an appearance from [Steve Vai](/interview/steve-vai). I was astounded at the incredible drumming on the video. I saw Morgan's name credited as the drummer and talked to my super-musical friend Todd in Chicago via America Online about him. He told me about Morgan's involvement with a blind Swedish keyboard player named Mats Oberg and their duo band Mats/Morgan.

Since the late 1990s, I've loosely followed Morgan's career and became more aware when my friend [Carl King](/interview/carl-king) made a documentary about Morgan called [Morgan Agren's Conundrum](http://shop.carlkingdom.com/products/conundrum_dvd).

At some point in late June 2016, I wrote to Morgan asking if he'd ever do an interview. He got back to me within two weeks and we got things scheduled pretty quickly. He's such a nice, down-to-earth guy and it was pretty easy to get things going. I hope you enjoy our interview! It was a real pleasure for me to talk with such a creative genius.

## Interview Transcript

Anthony: Hi, this is Anthony with MakeWeirdMusic.com and I'm here with Morgan Agren who has joined us all the way from Sweden. Morgan, thank you very much for joining us. Let's just get started. The purpose of the site is to get people to learn about new musicians and new kinds of music. Could you introduce yourself and tell us about your musical history and tell us about why people might know who you are as a musician?
{: .interviewer }

Morgan: Yeah. Thanks for calling me, by the way. I'm happy to be here. I think I heard about your site or your activities quite recently, actually, and then I found an email from you in this weird hidden folder in Facebook Messenger and, as you might know, if you're not friends with the people you get a message from, it goes into this kind of hidden folder. Sometimes I check this folder because, who knows? And then I found you there just a few weeks after I heard some snippets from an interview you did with... Anthony Levin?
{: .interviewee }

A: Oh, Markus Reuter?
{: .interviewer }

M: Oh, sorry! Ben Levin, I mean.
{: .interviewee }

A: Oh, Ben Levin! Yes.
{: .interviewer }

M: Yes, Ben Levin from Bent Knee. So, that's where I noticed your Make Weird Music thing.
{: .interviewee }

A: Awesome!
{: .interviewer }

M: So yeah, my name is Morgan and I am a drummer, musician, composer living in Stockholm, outside of Stockholm in Sweden. I just turned 49 and, not 50 yet but getting there. I started to play at age 4 or 5 or something on the drums and met my musical partner at age 14 and he was 10. I met Mats Oberg, who is my life-long musical partner and that's where it started for me, I think. Before that, my father was in a Swedish so-called dance band and they were my first idols. That's where it really started because they were a big influence on me. When I went to school, you get a pen and paper and write whatever you want and I wrote a lot about them, his band, about their tubas... So there's hundreds of pages about my dad's band. Obviously they were my first idols and my first time on stage was with them one day. They had me come up on stage to play when I was 7. So that was my premiere and that's where it kind of started. What else? I started a record company in 1996 and released 15, 20 albums or something and then I moved onto a label called Cuneiform because it was too much work that didn't have too much to do with music. You know, paperwork and all that stuff. It was a good period still because it was a good experience to make your own albums and release them and try to get them out. I released my own albums on this label, but I also released projects with other friends like my brother, Frederik [Thordendal] from Meshuggah--he did his solo album, which is probably the most, maybe not most, but when it comes to releases, that's probably the one that's most famous. His album Sol Niger Within. I released that in 1997 and I did some projects with Denny Walley, former guitarist from Frank Zappa and Tom Waits. And then I played with Frank [Zappa], of course. Some people know me from that. I played with Frank Zappa when I was 20 the first time and then he invited me to the US later on, a few years before he passed away. I used to be a member of a Swedish group called Flesh Quartet and, yeah, that's a little bit on my background.
{: .interviewee }

A: I found out about you through Zappa's Universe. I bought the VHS copy of the concert and I said, "Who's the keyboard player and who's that drummer?" because you guys weren't a part of the standard Zappa touring band.
{: .interviewer }

M: No.
{: .interviewee }

A: And then I found out about Mats/Morgan and it's just unbelievable music. So, can you tell us about--you mentioned a musical partner and in the interviews I've done so far on the site, no one's really mentioned having a musical partner. You guys have been making music since you were kids together, so can you tell us about how that started and where it's gone and what's special about Mats that makes you guys so close musically?
{: .interviewer }

M: Yeah. And the thing about that is this year we actually are going to have our 35-year anniversary.
{: .interviewee }

A: Congratulations!
{: .interviewer }

M: It's kind of unreal how much time we actually have had together. I see it truly as a gift because--I remember when I met Mats. I was 14 and he was 10 and I knew already by then that this is such a nice meeting. I could tell from the first moment that this is--"Wow, this can really be good and this already is good." Now, 35 years later, you can look back at what happened from another perspective. At that time, I was happy about it, of course, and I was excited and everything. But now, 35 years later, you look at these years in a more humble way or a thankful way or something because meetings like these don't happen often. I put more value on the fact that I met him now than at the time when we played. How that happened was I received a phone call from a lady in my hometown and she--actually, this is coincidence, but I can try to--[holds up a photo of Mats, Morgan, and a woman between them] can you see this?
{: .interviewee }

A: Yeah, I can see it.
{: .interviewer }

M: The woman there in the middle--this picture was taken in 2002, maybe? This lady is actually the lady who called me that day in 1981. She called me--somebody called me--but she called me and said, "Hello, my name is blah-blahblah and I'm running a little music cafe outside Umea," me and Mats' hometown, "and I'm going to have this guy call you named Mats Oberg who plays piano and he's gonna call you and play some 15-20 minutes there. I read about you in a local magazine and I just had a sense that you and he would fit together." That's what she told me and at this moment, I didn't know anything about Mats. The only thing I knew was that I heard while being on vacation with my family once was that I was listening to the radio and the guy was super young that talked on the radio and played fantastic music. You know, music that never gets played on the radio and the guy--probably at the time, maybe 9--playing music on the radio. That I heard on the radio and I started to realize that maybe I heard this guy on the radio once, but other than that I didn't know anything about him. But I got the request to come out to this place and play drums with him and so I did and I was happy to get this request. I went there and we met probably 2 hours before the concert and we were supposed to play 15-20 minutes. So we met on the venue, shook hands, and he looked like he was 7 or 8, even though he was 10, he looked really tiny. We started to discuss what we could possibly play, but it has to be covers now because we just met and we're going to be on stage in 2 hours. So he started to ask me, "Do you know this and this and this and this band?" So he asked me, "Do you know The Beatles?" And the only song I knew by them at the time that I could possibly play without rehearsing was *Help!* so I said, "Okay, I know *Help!*" And then, of course, whatever I said, he knew it. That was the crazy thing. "Do you know it?" "Yes, I know it." "Okay, do you know Stevie Wonder?" he continues. And then for some reason, I had a friend whose older brother just bought *Hotter Than July* and when I was at his house, he played that album, so I remembered the first track, *Master Blaster*, and I told Mats, "I know this song. This reggae type of *Master Blaster* maybe. Do you know it?" "Yeah, I know it," he says. Okay, so now we had two songs, so we need at least one more, so he asked me, "Do you know Frank Zappa?" and of course, *Bobby Brown* was the only one I knew. He knew that one, too, of course, so then we had three songs and we had a short little sound check and then we went on stage and just played. Super tiny little house, like a cabin, I'd say with 10-15 people in the audience. The room would take maybe 30 people and that would be fully packed. I remember almost--I really remember clearly that I was totally amazed by the fact that--I mean, I was doing a concert, but at the same time, I was in the audience because I was also watching him play in disbelief. He was standing up with his electric grand and he played--the electric grand was almost to his chin and then he played incredibly and he sang in almost perfect--the language was good, but his mother didn't let him sing the ugly words in *Bobby Brown*, so he left those out, but other than that he was singing and playing in an incredible way. I remember also after the concert--both of our parents were there. My dad and his dad were there because they were driving us with our car to the venue. After, we met backstage and both our parents were really touched from having seen their kids do that together with 2 hours--almost no preparation at all. I think my dad, what I could see, was almost crying because of what he saw. Mats' father was also really--he started to say to me, "Maybe you could do this again. We have drums in the basement and," blah blah blah blah blah. He really wanted--he saw more possibility that Mats found a friend who liked the same music as he did. So that was basically how we met and this photograph that I showed you, this happened in 2002. This lady called me up again and I hadn't spoken with her since 1981, but she called me and asked me, "Is this the number of Morgan Agren?" I said, "Yeah, it's me." "So, yes, my name is and I live here and there and I guess you remember the first time you played with Mats in that cafe." And I go, "Yeah." "The girl who called you there--that was me." And I got the chills because I was wondering so many times, "Who was this lady that called me out of the blue having this idea of me and Mats getting together?" So, next time we went to our hometown, we set up a meeting with her and we went over to her house to say hello and have a cup of coffee and take some photos. So that's the very first time and this was in November 1981. After that, me and Mats, we met if not on a weekly basis, which was the most case. Sometimes maybe it went 2 or 3 weeks, but it was quite regularly for the next 35 years, more or less. I have never been out of contact with Mats more than a few weeks since then. We have been doing a lot of other things. We play all the time, but sometimes we both play with other acts. This is not the only thing we do, but we have played all the way since then. We've toured all over the world and played with a lot of our teenage idols and whatever. It was a really good meeting and I'm really happy for that, of course.
{: .interviewee }

A: One thing you didn't mention is that he's blind.
{: .interviewer }

M: Yes, he's blind. I would have been equally amazed about what he did when we did this first gig. But, the fact that he's blind makes everything even more amazing. He's born blind and I think that a guy like him that's born with a thing like this--the focus in life gets only--his thing in life is music. Music and food. That's what he enjoys. He doesn't care about too many other things and that's how we developed this ability. This happened very early, a long time before I met him, because I know for sure that he was listening to--when he was 2 or 3 years old, he was listening to the typical lullaby music as all the other kids at the same time as he was listening to Mahivishnu Orchestra because that he actually did when he was 3 or 4 years old. So, a little bit Miles [Davis], a little bit Mahivishnu, and a little bit of lullabies. He went back and forth between really different music and "diaper music," if I may say so. I know some stories from his childhood that he was really--I think his parents gave him some kind of downer. He had to eat something that took his energy down because he was listening to music for, I think maybe 10 hours straight without any breaks. He got hyper and he was scratching vinyls, listening to it backwards--everything was just about sound, sound, sound, sound. I know that for instance when he was 7, he sort of forced his parents to buy the latest Earth, Wind, & Fire album. Otherwise, he had a stair at home and he went to the end of the stairs and stood on the edge and said, "If you don't buy the latest album, I'll jump." Stuff like that because he was really--"I *really* want the last Earth, Wind, & Fire. Get it for me otherwise I jump." Stuff like that. Really into it.
{: .interviewee }

A: Wow, that's astonishing. Did you guys study together musically? Did you study music? Any formal music education or is everything just through self-learning?
{: .interviewer }

M: I would say self-learning although we went to the same high school in Stockholm, but we started so early and for me, everything I do comes from me listening to albums and just listening and being inspired. I got so much inspiration from listening to all these albums at an early age. Everything was on these albums. I didn't really have any questions because everything was there and the "only problem" was to do it yourself. That's something you have to develop, of course. But I think that as soon as you hear something and as soon as you really feel that "this is really what I like, this is really what I want to do, I don't want to do that, but I want to do this," and as soon as you know and feel that in a way, I think you're halfway because then it's about personality in the music and the whole spirit and everything because the music is like a mirror of yourself. So when you get this inspiration and you realize that--for instance, when I heard a few of those albums that really opened up a new universe for me was an album called *Road Games* by Allan Holdsworth. All these chords and the harmonies, besides him being a fantastic guitarist, but the music, the compositions took me just somewhere else, where I wanted to be. This was just, "I'm home. This is really what I like." If I hadn't run into an album like that at age 14 or something like that, maybe 15... I don't know. That album and many others, of course, but those albums were really important for me in not only as a musician playing drums trying to compose, but also as an individual. In a spiritual way. It was really important. Another album that I was listening to on and on was Return to Forever *Romantic Warrior* and the first album by UK. Bill Bruford's *One of a Kind*, Brecker Brothers' *Heavy Metal Bebop*... There are many, but those albums just kept going on and on and on and on and on. When you have that, going to a school--I know that I started so early so I'm aware of the fact that it was quite easy for me to play because I started early. I don't say that school would be useless or anything, but for me the inspiration and the energy I got from the albums was worth more than any drum book in the world or any school. The schools were good too because I met nice people and even had some good teachers that inspired me. But, yeah, so me and Mats, we don't read music. I'm a lousy reader and Mats, obviously, is blind so he doesn't read it. But, we just listen and learn from that.
