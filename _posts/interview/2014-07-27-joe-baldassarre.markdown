Dr. Joe Baldassarre is a professor emeritus at [Boise State University](http://boisestate.edu). He taught medieval and classical music, published music history and theory (and baseball!) author, performed with and led several bands in Boise, Idaho, and released [a few musical works](http://www.cdbaby.com/Artist/JosephBaldassarre) His most recent release, *The Path*, is a mix of progressive rock stylings and early medieval/renaissance music with some [Canterbury-style](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canterbury_scene) instrumentation and arrangements.

The album features 9 tracks, most of which are original tracks with a couple of modern arrangements of 15th century music and a prog cover of *[Will You (Still) Love Me Tomorrow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_You_Love_Me_Tomorrow)*, made famous by the Shirelles in the early 1960s. Dr. Joe plays several of the instruments on the album, including electric/acoustic/slide guitar, bass, drums, keyboards, vocals, [symphonia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphonia), lute, penny whistle, saxophone, flute, [fife](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fife_(instrument)), and harmonica. I don't know about you, but that list makes me feel like an underachiever.

Listening through the album as I write, I am reminded of these bands:

- [Egg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(band))
- [Gentle Giant](/discover/gentle-giant)
- [Renaissance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_(band))
- [Peter Gabriel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Gabriel)-era [Genesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_(band))
- Early [King Crimson](/discover/king-crimson)
- [Emerson, Lake, and Palmer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerson,_Lake_%26_Palmer)

My friend Jake Ineck, an amazing musician and student of Baldassarre's, gave me a copy of *The Path* and offered me the opportunity to interview Dr. Joe.

- Working as a music professor
- Listening to and finding new music
- Progressive rock
- Blending genres, a la Gentle Giant
