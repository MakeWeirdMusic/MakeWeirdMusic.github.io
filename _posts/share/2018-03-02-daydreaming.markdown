## Background

[The California Guitar Trio](http://cgtrio.com) performed a show at the [Musical Instrument Museum](http://mim.org) in Phoenix, Arizona on February 24, 2018. Before the show, we spent about an hour talking and filmed a great interview, which should be online and available later this month. In the meantime, I wanted to release this beautiful performance of [Radiohead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiohead)'s song *Daydreaming*.

This is our first 4K video release, too. So, hopefully you high-fidelity video fans enjoy that! It's still new to me, but I'm happy with how it turned out.
