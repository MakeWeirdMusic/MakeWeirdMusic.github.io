## About Tiny Orchestral Moments
T.O.M. began in 2016 as a [twelve-week series of performances initiated by the Seattle Guitar Circle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0o8Fb-jThw) that ran weekly from January 7th – March 24th at the [Seattle Creative Arts Center](https://www.facebook.com/Seattle-Creative-Arts-Center-142947199172829/) in Ballard. Each week, the ensemble of ~12 (former) [Crafty Guitarists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Craft) presented a dynamic show based upon an intricate and evolving repertoire spanning Bach to Fripp to Ives, punctuated with pockets of Structured Improvisation with guitarists flowing, moving, Circulating and playing in and around the entire performance space.

*In August 2016, a global [TOM v1 team spent a full week working in Seattle](https://www.facebook.com/stevebal/videos/10155200416731562/?hc_ref=PAGES_TIMELINE), and presented a major show at the Chapel – then recorded [five CDs of music](http://www.steveball.com/TOM) and a documentary film at  [London Bridge studio](http://www.londonbridgestudio.com/) – all releasing in Fall of 2017.* This new show continues the previous Tiny Orchestral Moments format by inviting an expanded array of world-class players from around the globe to continue collaboration within an evolving repertoire of Structured Improvisation.

## About Seattle Guitar Circle
Seattle Guitar Circle was founded in 1993 by [Steve Ball](http://www.allmusic.com/artist/steve-ball-mn0000032276) (in collaboration with [Bill Rieflin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Rieflin)) after the first generation of the [League of Crafty Guitarists](http://thelcg.net/) disbanded near the end of a three-year world tour in 1992. Over 24+ years, the Seattle Guitar Circle community staffed spin-off projects like the [Atomic Chamber Ensemble](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwJSKUkNUjI), the [Steve Ball Roadshow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-jgqh1WKmA), and the acclaimed seven-year weekly performance project: [Tuning the Air](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZDi1KOIQOM). Tiny Orchestral Moments is a new, recurring performance workshop developed by Steve Ball and the evolving Seattle music community. T.O.M. is building on a multi-decade tradition of unique, large-ensemble composition techniques such as Circulation, Group Loops and Structured Improvisation.
