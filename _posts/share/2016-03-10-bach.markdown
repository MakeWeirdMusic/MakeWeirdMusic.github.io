In December 2013, I released a math-rock/progressive cover version of one of my favorite Bach compositions, [Concert for Violin and Oboe Mov. 1, Allegro (BWV 1060R)&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm far fa-external-link-square"></i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_concertos_by_Johann_Sebastian_Bach#Concerto_in_C_minor.2C_BWV_1060). It's a total shred-fest.

This performance features:

- [Sebastian Lanser&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm far fa-external-link-square"></i>](http://sebastianlanser.com) of [Panzerballett](/discover/panzerballett) on drums
- [Andy West](/interview/andy-west) of the [Dixie Dregs&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm far fa-external-link-square"></i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dixie_Dregs) on bass
- Adam Strand (an organist I met at my church) on keyboards
- Bryce Bickham of [Crimsontone Amplifiers&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm far fa-external-link-square"></i>](http://crimsontone.com), who [re-amped&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm far fa-external-link-square"></i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Re-amp) all my guitar parts through his awesome handmade amps

Sebastian's drum parts are jaw-dropping. Andy's bass parts are so fun. Adam's arrangement contributions brought new life to my too-technical work.

## How and Why

This is a piece of music I've loved for many years and always knew I wanted to record my own version. I put my stamp on it by messing around with the rhythm of the main motif, which is in 11/8. It took about 10 months to complete the arrangement.

It's incredibly complex and difficult to perform, well beyond anything I'd previously recorded. There were several parts I couldn't easily perform as originally written, so I translated those parts into different time signatures and added notes to make them playable. Some parts require some pretty tricky finger-tapping on both hands. It's more like playing a keyboard on a fretboard than finger-tapping like Eddie Van Halen.

I entered all the notes into Logic Pro and used its tablature features to determine the best way to play (and memorize) the various parts. Then I recorded all the parts direct into Logic and sent them to Bryce to re-amp through his beautiful Crimsontone Amps.

Sebastian, Andy, and Adam each told me that this was one of the hardest songs they'd ever performed. I guess that's some sort of stamp of honor. Heh.
