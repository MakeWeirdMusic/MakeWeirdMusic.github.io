## New Old Music

I covered Robert Fripp's *Erudite Eyes* in 2011, posted it to YouTube, and forgot about it. Six years later, I stumbled upon it again and found that I really liked what I did. So, in a fit of creativity and motivation, I recorded this video to go along with the song. I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed making it.

For reference, my cover is quite a bit darker/moodier than the original. I spent time "updating" it to something more aligned with what Robert might write and release today. There is quite a bit more dissonance and it's much less cheerful. The song originally came out in 1968 on the pre-[King Crimson](/discover/king-crimson) album, [*The Cheerful Insanity of Giles, Giles, and Fripp*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cheerful_Insanity_of_Giles,_Giles_and_Fripp), an album I grew up listening to and still enjoy decades later.

If you haven't heard the original, I highly encourage you to check it out. It's very different.
