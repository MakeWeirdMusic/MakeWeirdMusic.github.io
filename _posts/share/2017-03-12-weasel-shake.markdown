## Weasel Shake

In March 2017, I went to New York on a business trip and bumped into Robbie Seahag (more on that in a later video), whose name you may recall from our rooftop recording of [*33 in Buffalo*](/learn/33-in-buffalo) off his sold-out album, *Full Moon Fever*. As I accidentally stumbled upon his residence, he quickly taught me another song from *Full Moon Fever* and we recorded this fun video.

## Video

You should check out Robbie's new album, [*Bumbleweenie*&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm far fa-external-link-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://www.bumbleweenie.com), and buy one of his donation packages.

## Video Stuff

Robbie graciously offered to do some wonderful animation to make this video stand out from the rest. I'm proud to feature this song on the site and to have participated in this recording. Thank you, Robbie!!

Stay tuned for some really fun, funny, and ridiculous content from my day with Robbie. Gonna make your cheeks hurt. I had a headache from laughing so hard.

## Bumbleweenie

Here's a commercial for Robbie's amazing new album, *Bumbleweenie*.
