## A Preface

Make Weird Music promises never to repurpose other people's content and to always link directly to third party content. We are proud of the huge amount of original content we provide and promote and believe it's worth marketing and paying for, especially when it's used to promote the amazing artists we present on the site. I promise the site will have as little to do with myself as possible. I also promise to do my best to be level-headed, but I can't promise I won't make a mistake or get heated and passionate.

## Okay, this is weird!

I'll admit, I never expected to write a piece of content on the site like this, but here we go. First of all, I think everyone can tell from the video content on the site that I'm a pretty laid-back guy and I'm pretty passionate about artists getting recognized first and foremost. I don't assume everyone else is out there for the same reasons, but when it comes to the kinds of artists I like, I think they usually need all the help they can get in the current economy.

A few weeks ago, I came across [an interview with Billy Cobham&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square"></i>](http://drumtalktv.com/portfolio/billy-cobham/) on a site called [Drum Talk TV&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square"></i>](http://drumtalktv.com). It was a cool interview promoting an event coming to Mesa, AZ (where I live), so I got all excited and emailed the site asking to get together because they're based in Phoenix. How cool, right?

<div class="video-wrapper"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/172173613?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/172173613">Exclusive Billy Cobham Interview June 2016</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/drumtalktv">Drum Talk TV</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p></div>

Well, then I find them on Facebook and see what they're doing. Turns out they're uploading content produced by other people to [their facebook page&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square"></i>](http://www.facebook.com/DrumTalkTV) and getting tons of followers. I thought it was pretty anomalous that a drum channel would get such a rapid and huge following, so I started digging deeper. Turns out they've gotten 850,000 FB followers in 3 1/2 years! Amazing, right?

Well, I look into [their content submission guidelines&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square"></i>](http://drumtalktv.com/video-submission-guidelines/) and find the following:

> Please send your video via a link from a 3rd-party broadcast platform, such as YouTube or Vimeo, we can download it from there if we use it.

Umm? So, I start looking at their FB posts and they're usually referencing the artists, but they don't link to artist pages and they don't thank anyone for the content. It kinda gives the impression that they're filming and releasing all this amazing content. But they're not. They ARE releasing some cool content, but it's a significant minority of what I'm seeing in their marketing.

I also found out that the guy who runs the site, Dan Shinder, runs a program called [Social Media on Steroids&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square"></i>](http://www.smosmasterclass.com), which has pictures of Dan presenting to a group of people at NAMM about growing a business. My immediate thoughts were, "There's a presentation to artists and companies at a major music industry event about how to use other people's content to grow your business? You've got to be kidding me!" Like he says in the video: "We teach how we've done this without advertising and without boosting."

<div class="video-wrapper"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/167967812?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" width="640" height="352" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/167967812">Musicians: Time to Get Results!</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/drumtalktv">Drum Talk TV</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p></div>

I'm no social media guru, but I work at a digital marketing company. The way his FB page is running is incongruous with the way the rest of Drum Talk TV is running. 850K FB followers, but [1,200 Twitter followers&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square"></i>](https://twitter.com/DrumTalkTV), [no followers/likes on 278 original videos on Vimeo&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square"></i>](https://vimeo.com/drumtalktv) (despite an interview with Mike Portnoy and his son Max!), which made me feel like artists are getting the short end of the stick while Dan Shinder and Drum Talk TV get "likes, comments, and shares" that help him sell his social marketing program. If you look at the other channels, there's not much going on, so this clearly isn't a comprehensive strategy built on meaningful, original content.

And look at me! I'm practically advertising for him! (Any publicity is good publicity, right?)

Thus began the following email exchange.

## Email exchange

I did not receive Dan's permission to post his emails in their entirety, so I'll summarize them here instead.

> Hi Dan,
>
> My name is Anthony and I run a website called Make Weird Music, which features creative, in-depth interviews with musicians around the world. I came across your site tonight and found out you're in Phoenix! I'm in Mesa. It would be really cool to get together and talk about what we're doing with these music website projects. Looks like you've got a full-time thing going on, but I work at a software development company and do the website in my spare time.
>
> Anyway, if you're interested in getting together or talking, let me know!
>
> Anthony

Drum Talk TV's paraphrased response:

> Hi Anthony,
>
> We're going to send your message to our CEO, Dan Shinder. We've grown a lot in 3 1/2 years with millions of people talking about us despite never paying for advertising.
>
> Dan's filming a special with Billy Cobham and will get back to you.

Okay. I didn't ask about their growth, but whatever. Sounds cool! Dan writes back shortly offering to get together and saying he loves what I'm doing. That's cool. Then I come across a video from their Facebook feed from a friend and look up their content submission guidelines. Here's what I sent:

> Hi Dan, Candi, and others on the Drum Talk TV team,
>
> Thanks for getting back in touch with me recently about getting together to talk about my Make Weird Music project.
>
> I’ve been looking through your facebook feed noticing that most of your content is not your original content and you even have a statement on your submission guidelines page that states: "Please send your video via a link from a 3rd-party broadcast platform, such as YouTube or Vimeo, we can download it from there if we use it.”
>
> As a content creator, I’m curious as to why I’m not seeing the content creators credited in your posts and why you don’t link to them so they can benefit from the hundreds of thousands of followers they’ve generated for you on your page. If you go through the trouble of re-downloading existing content and uploading it as your own, isn’t the effort to attribute the source (a basic journalistic practice) a simple, small additional thing to do?
>
> Even the musicians performing in these videos don’t get links to their pages. If the intent is to promote these artists, why not give your followers a chance to follow the artists themselves?
>
> I was looking forward to meeting with Dan to talk about our mutual music projects, but I find this stance on content attribution pretty discouraging and am personally concerned that my content may get repurposed by your channel without attribution.
>
> For example, here is a post you created today: [https://www.facebook.com/DrumTalkTV/videos/1093114114100585/](https://www.facebook.com/DrumTalkTV/videos/1093114114100585/)
>
> And here is the original content creator’s video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuOxN2lx9HA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuOxN2lx9HA)
>
> Is there a particular reason you don’t link to the original content creator’s facebook page? Or at least to their youtube channel? These links took me seconds to find and it’s even easier when other people send you to the 3rd party page so you can download and upload their content as your own.
>
> And in case this might seem like a one-time occurrence, here are some other links to videos of other people’s content that have been repurposed for your own use within the past 24 hours:
>
> “Your” video, posted today: [https://www.facebook.com/DrumTalkTV/videos/1101211763290820/](https://www.facebook.com/DrumTalkTV/videos/1101211763290820/)

> The music industry is having a hard enough time surviving as it is because of software companies selling the works of artists at slices of pennies apiece. Why would someone who consults musicians and companies at NAMM be operating in this fashion? What if I were to take Dan’s original work with Billy Cobham and upload it to my channel calling it my own? Would you consider it fair use? Would it be ethical?
>
> Going with the best assumption that there is no ill will to take other people’s content, I would love to see a change in behavior on Drum Talk TV’s channel with proper adherence to accepted journalistic ethical practices: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_(journalism)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_(journalism))
>
> I have already talked to a couple friends about this and they’re unfollowing your channel immediately. This isn’t a threat, just a reality that there are people who don’t want to support companies that don’t properly attribute.

I also included a screenshot from a friend's FB post where this person said he was unfollowing them and had always wondered why the video quality was so low.

Perhaps this was entirely uncalled for. I don't know. I was super passionate/heated at the time.

Dan wrote back shortly and I'm paraphrasing here:

> Hey Anthony,
>
> There's a lot more here than meets the eye and I'd rather talk in person.
>
> 20% of our Facebook content is our original content, 50% of the rest of it is sent to us and we post as is. 100% of what you see on the website is original.
>
> We use Facebook to curate content. If we didn't do it this way, a small piece of our existing audience would see the content and we'd be doing very little for the artists. By posting like this, we give artists significant exposure.
>
> People thank us all the time for the free exposure we provide and it leads to all sorts of great opportunities for them.
>
> We are a media company and we give proper credit in our posts. Look at our numbers! The major news networks rarely credit their sources, but we do.
>
> I'm available to chat with you some time.
>
> Our methods work in and out of the music industry, too.

My response:

> Thanks for your prompt response. I appreciate it and I get your perspective. You are making the most of the way the Facebook algorithm works today, which is understandable, but I cannot agree ethically to your argument. I am not a confrontational person and I don't like going in this direction, and I can't convince myself to do otherwise.
>
> I would love to see this question of ethics posted on your Facebook page. Perhaps asking your 800K followers whether they agree with your submission guidelines statement of downloading 3rd party content as part of "curation" as a "News, Publishing, and Media" company. Ask some of the prominent artists you represent whether they appreciate your downloading of their content, re-publishing it without attribution (or express permission?), and share some of the answers (positive and negative) you receive.
>
> Whatever your justification is, I can tell you that many musicians I know, as well as myself, are offended at the idea that you are doing us a favor by using our content on your page as "promotion" of our work. You know as well as I do (I work for one of the valley's largest digital marketing firms and we run a social media analytics platform, which gives us plenty of insight into this stuff) that most people don't follow up the way you're describing. They largely do not copy and paste artist names (sometimes misspelled, "Liberty DeVito" [sic]) into a search field to find their pages and follow those artists. They also largely do not click links to non-Facebook websites to see all your original content.
>
> This can be evidenced by the fact that a majority (~75%) of your 100 YouTube videos have fewer than 2000 views and the rest (save 3) also have relatively low view count and your Vimeo collection of 278 original videos (that's a HUGE amount of work!!) has 2 followers, 3 likes, and no discernible comments. There's no significant following on Twitter either and little promotion of your original content. I don't say this to get into a numbers war, nor to be competitive, but it's clear where the priorities are for you and your team when looking at your various marketing channels. And your touting of social media capabilities as a consultant is awkwardly unbalanced between these channels.
>
> The original work you do is great, but that is hardly touted on your FB channel. I really enjoyed a couple of your interviews and that's what attracted me to your work. You're enthusiastic, you appreciate and love the artists, and you probably have the same purpose I do: to help and promote the work of real artists.
>
> I'm happy to meet/talk and discuss this, but you are unlikely to convince me that you're putting equal effort into promoting the work of others when someone ELSE has to mention Row-Loff in a comment on their video repurposed on your channel and they don't even thank you for it. Row-Loff got 8 new likes from your video with 1,250 shares, by the way. Sounds like a great opportunity was somehow missed by them!
>
> Your audience is so large at this point, why manipulate the game anymore? Why not link directly to the artists? Or do so in a comment (which doesn't seem to affect reach)? Or do a separate post? Or post your original content with that artist and link to THAT in the comment? You have so much great content, why not promote that? And now that you have a team, why don't you pay for any promotion? Why tout that you've grown your audience to that size for free when it's largely based on the content of others?
>
> Lastly, do you mind if I publicly post this exchange so I can solicit the thoughts of my following across all my channels? I'd love to get their thoughts.
>
> Anthony

And I followed up with:

> Also, thanks for your patience. You didn't ask for my ranting and maybe you don't deserve a letter of it. This is a hot button item for me and I want to make sure the artists you and I BOTH love get as much opportunity as possible without anything else getting in their way. :)

His response:

> There is no "argument."

## Your thoughts

So, what do you think? Am I out of line? Was I arrogant and presumptuous? Is he providing proper attribution by saying who was performing without linking the viewer anywhere or naming the author of the video?

There's a part of me that regrets calling him out and there's a part of me that's proud to stand up for artists. I looked up several of the artists Drum Talk TV mentioned in the past few days and NONE of them have seen an uptick in FB followers. Literally, one of the posts today was shared over 1,200 times and netted the content producer 8 new followers. Eight. Fewer than ten.

Dan seems like a nice guy and I think we have a lot of overlapping tastes. It probably would have been real cool to collaborate with him, but I blew that chance. It's never too late and I still stand behind my feelings, even though I may have acted inappropriately.

I generally am not a person looking to explicitly seek feedback on MWM as it's just something I do for the artists and my own creative satisfaction that other people seem to enjoy. Nevertheless, I'd love to get your feedback if you happened to read through my blathering.

After all this played out, I had a sense of what Robert Fripp was so upset about over the years in which he was arguing with streaming services and record labels that hadn't paid out royalties and were breaching distribution contracts. Sometimes it feels like the people who work the hardest can't win. The best strategy in my mind is to have done nothing, but sometimes I can't bite my tongue when I see something that seems so unethical from a person in my neighborhood.

I kept thinking about him taking my [Michael Manring house concert](/concert/michael-manring), downloading the 20-minute clip of Michael and Andy West playing, distributing it through some channel, and me never finding out about it. All the work I put into it. All the money we put into it. All the lighting Michael Nitro and his team put into it. Taken by a Facebook channel.

By the way, [here's an article&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square"></i>](http://daringfireball.net/2011/07/attribution_and_credit) that nicely describes my view on attribution. Particularly:

> Linking is indeed key. You get a story from somewhere else, you link to the original when you post about it. That’s the first rule of web attribution.

My wife says this happens all the time in the food blogging industry. My wife is very careful to attribute [on her site&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square"></i>](http://alovelettertofood.com), but she says sees famous food bloggers use the same recipe from somewhere else and do something as simple as adding dried parsley to the top of the food, but it's the same exact recipe she's seen elsewhere and the recipe gets no attribution. (Unlike Drum Talk TV, however, these food bloggers don't even mention that the recipe came from the mind of another person.)

But hey, great exposure, right? All I know is I'd better be careful setting up and recording a house concert with a famous drummer.
