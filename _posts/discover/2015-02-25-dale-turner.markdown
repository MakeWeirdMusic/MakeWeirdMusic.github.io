## Who is Dale Turner?

Dale is one of the most talented, funny, extraordinary people in the Los Angeles area. He plays every instrument in western music. Overall A++ guy.

**[<i class="fab fa-youtube"></i> Check out our interview with Dale!](/interview/dale-turner)**

## What does Dale do?

Dale Turner is a guitar teacher at [Musician's Institute](http://mi.edu), [transcriptionist and journalist at Guitar World magazine](http://www.guitarworld.com/dale-turner), and multi-instrumentalist based in Los Angeles, CA. He's [transcribed a zillion albums](http://www.intimateaudio.com/books.html), was an editor for Guitar One magazine, and is as humble as he is talented. His 2010 album, *Mannerisms Magnified*, is a fantastic release in which he played every instrument, wrote all the lyrics, mixed, edited, produced, and engineered, etc. The songs are unique and fun. You can [purchase *Mannerisms Magnified* from CarlKingdom.com](http://shop.carlkingdom.com/collections/cds/products/dale-turner-mannerisms-magnified).

## Is Dale a Nice Guy?

Yes. Super nice.

## How do you know?

I met Dale via [Carl King](/discover/carl-king) in 2011 on Facebook and we met in person shortly after. We connected on several musical influences, like [Chris Cornell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Cornell), [Steve Vai](/discover/steve-vai), and Carl's musical personalities Sir Millard Mulch and Dr. Zoltan Ã˜belisk. Anyone who loves Chris Cornell's *[Euphoria Morning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria_Morning)* album as much as I do is a friend of mine.

## Okay, what about his music?

*Mannerisms Magnified* opens with an incredible perverse tribute to [Brian Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Wilson), followed by some really cool [Elliott Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Smith)-inspired songs with complex chord changes and time signatures. There are hints of [Mr. Bungle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Bungle)/[Mike Patton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Patton) throughout, as well as [Iron Maiden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Maiden). As Dale says in [our interview](/interview/dale-turner), "You can't escape the Maiden."

*Interpretations* is an album full of Dale's interpretations of various pop songs. Armed with his voice and an acoustic guitar, there's tons to enjoy on here, from silly bird sounds in *Blackbird* to a solo operatic arrangement of *Bohemian Rhapsody* with plenty of falsetto vocals. There are so many priceless moments and many tender ones as well. Don't miss his cover of The Beach Boys' *God Only Knows*. Simply wonderful!!

I don't think he's released any other music, but I'm probably wrong about that. Anyway, there's plenty to check out and enjoy.
