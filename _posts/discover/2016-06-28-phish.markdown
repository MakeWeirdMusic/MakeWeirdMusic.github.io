## A LITTLE ABOUT PHISH

Phish is an improvisation-focused rock quartet formed in Burlington, Vermont and consisting of members [Trey Anastasio&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm far fa-external-link-square"></i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trey_Anastasio) (guitars, lead vocals), [Mike Gordon&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm far fa-external-link-square"></i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Gordon) (bass, vocals), [Jon Fishman&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm far fa-external-link-square"></i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Fishman) (drums, percussion, vacuum, vocals), and [Page McConnell&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm far fa-external-link-square"></i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_McConnell) (keyboards, vocals). Their stylistically whimsical and genre-defying music includes hints of rock, jazz, country, progressive rock, folk, funk, and more.

## WHAT'S SO WEIRD?

A lot of Phish's work makes use of the following weird music techniques:

- Time Signatures
- Composition
- Virtuosity
- Humor
- Surrealism
- Atonality

## WHY I CARE

In the summer of 1995 my musical interests were deeply rooted in the psychedelic blues of [Pink Floyd&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm far fa-external-link-square"></i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd) and the statistical density of composers like [Stravinsky&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm far fa-external-link-square"></i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Stravinsky), [Ravel&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm far fa-external-link-square"></i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravel), and [Zappa](/discover/frank-zappa). My ears were ever searching for interesting harmonies, complex [polyrhythms&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm far fa-external-link-square"></i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyrhythm) and [atonal&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm far fa-external-link-square"></i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atonality) [dissonance&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm far fa-external-link-square"></i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consonance_and_dissonance) while also maintaining roots in groove oriented blues and rock. It was a crossroad in my life. I was graduating from [thrash&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm far fa-external-link-square"></i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrash_metal) and [death metal&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm far fa-external-link-square"></i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_metal) and [70s stoner rock&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm far fa-external-link-square"></i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoner_rock) to more sophisticated rock music stylings. Coming from a history lightly battered in classical music sensibilities, I was lucky enough to have developed a bit of an ear for the weird and unorthodox in music and was well on my way to discovering and becoming engrossed in [Progressive Rock&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm far fa-external-link-square"></i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_rock).

It was about this time that a good friend and accomplice in music recommended I take a listen to a weird little band from Vermont called Phish. What struck me first was the name: Phish. I mean, why was it spelled that way? The first album I tucked into was called [*Junta*&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm far fa-external-link-square"></i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junta_(album)); another oddity in nomenclature. Needless to say, I was right off the bat intrigued. My intrigue heightened when I learned that they had a fan newsletter called [Doniac Schvice&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm far fa-external-link-square"></i>](http://forum.phish.net/forum/show/1303154865) which was comprised of nonsensical stories, poems, puzzles, anecdotes, instructions and surreal art provided 'from fish to tongue.' I haven't even heard the music yet and I'm having fun. This should be good.

Listening to *Junta* was, for me, a pretty life changing experience. I had simply never heard any music like this (this was before I found [Hatfield and the North&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm far fa-external-link-square"></i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatfield_and_the_North) and/or [National Health&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm far fa-external-link-square"></i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health), but more on that in another discovery). It was comical, cartoonish, whimsical, dark, surreal, absurdist, atonal, harmonic, virtuosic, psychedelic and rocking all at once. Until I found (and subsequently became obsessed with) Zappa, I had never heard something so bizarrely unique in rock music.

Over the course of the next--well, still actually, I followed the career of this band eating up everything I could get my ears on. I got all their albums which, as it turned out, only scratched the surface of their body of work. I learned that their live shows were ever changing and that no two performances ever sounded the same as they were incredible improvisors that made a point to explore musicality at every show. Songs became 'vehicles' of sonic exploration and going to a Phish show typically entailed getting tickets to several concurrent shows or following the band on tour a la the [Grateful Dead&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm far fa-external-link-square"></i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead) to hear all the different permutations of their songs via improvisation.

But all comparisons to the Grateful Dead aside, Phish has maintained an incredible body of work that is altogether weird, beautiful, organic, dissonant, and exploratory. As far as weird music is concerned, Phish, in my opinion, should be touted up alongside Zappa, [The Residents](/discover/the-residents), and others as a cornerstone of the 'genre.'

## WHAT YOU SHOULD HEAR FIRST

It's hard to pinpoint specific albums for different ideas because each record covers so much ground. Also, the recorded works are really only a fraction of what's available to enjoy. So I'll cover a few compositions that are core to the Phish experience and you can explore as you will from there.

For a well-rounded 'This is Phish' experience: *Harry Hood* off of [*A Live One*&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm far fa-external-link-square"></i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Live_One) or *Reba* off of [*Lawn Boy*&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm far fa-external-link-square"></i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawn_Boy). There is also an amazing live rendition available on YouTube [here&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm far fa-external-link-square"></i>](https://youtu.be/cnJlBWjDeXA) and [here&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm far fa-external-link-square"></i>](https://youtu.be/AKmIV1SY9gY).

For completely weird, Zappa-esque outlandishness: *David Bowie* off of *Junta* or *Split Open and Melt* off of *Lawn Boy*.

For compositional complexity: *All Things Reconsidered* off of [*Rift*&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm far fa-external-link-square"></i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rift_(album)) or *Fluffhead/Fluff's Travels* from *Junta*.

For balls-to-the-wall guitar rock: *Chalkdust Torture* from [*A Picture of Nectar*&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm far fa-external-link-square"></i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Picture_of_Nectar) or *Run Like an Antelope*, again from *Lawn Boy*.

For wonderful melody and songwriting: *Horn* from *Rift* or *Esther* from *Junta* or *Divided Sky* from *Junta*.

And if you're looking for something REALLY out there, check out *Dave's Energy Guide* or any improvisation labeled [*DEG*&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm far fa-external-link-square"></i>](http://phish.net/song/daves-energy-guide) (Phish has provided so much improvised content over their career that there is a meta-labeling system to help categorize different 'types of jams' from their library of work).

It would be foolish to try and pigeonhole Phish's music into a specific label or category. They simply do too much different shit to fit into a single bucket.
