## Who is Panzerballett?

Panzerballett are the best German jazz-metal band you've never heard. They are fearless, frighteningly talented, and fun. Each of their four albums are a great blend of twisted jazz-metal cover music and originals.

## What is "jazz metal?"

I came across this video of their excellent drummer, [Sebastian Lanser](http://sebastianlanser.com), tracking drums for *Zappa Medley From Hell, Pt. 1* from the album *Hart Genossen*:

The mastermind behind the band is a fantastic guitarist named [Jan Zehrfeld](http://www.jan-zehrfeld.de). The lineup of the band has changed a bit over the years, but has been pretty consistent as follows:

- Jan Zehrfeld: Guitar and vocals
- Josef Doblhofer: Guitar
- [Alexander von Hagke](http://www.alexandervonhagke.com): Sax
- [Heiko Jung](http://www.heikojung.com): Bass
- Sebastian Lanser: Drums

Touring with a jazz-metal band can be quite an expensive and difficult undertaking, but Panzerballett was able to make its way to Los Angeles in February 2013 and I drove the 7 hours from Phoenix to see them. Totally worth it. They are amazing live!

## What to listen to

My favorite songs are:

- *Reload*, *Abkrassen*, and *Zickenterror* from their eponymous debut, *Panzerballett* (2005)
- *M. w. M. i. O. f. R.*, Deep Purple's *Smoke on the Water*, *Friede, Freude, Fußball*, Scorpions' *Wind of Change*, Coltrane's *Birdland*, and AC/DC's *Thunderstruck* from *Starke Stücke* (2008)
- *Bird Wild Web*, Rammstein's *Mein Teil*, *Gimme, Gimme, Gimme*, *The Mediterranean Breeze*, Nicole Hohloch's *Ein Bisschen Frieden*, *Zappa Medley From Hell* from *Hart Genossen: von Abba bis Zappa* (2009)
- The Brecker Brothers' *Some Skunk Funk*, *Mustafari Likes Di Carnival*, John Coltrane's *Giant Steps*, and Paul Desmond's/Dave Brubeck's *Take Five* from *Tank Goodness* (2012)

## What makes them weird?

There are many aspects of Panzerballett that make them unique. They frequently exploit odd time signatures and polyrhythms. A perfect example of this is their cover of Some *Skunk Funk* on *Tank Goodness*. I listened to it dozens of times trying to figure out what the underlying time signature was, but kept finding myself counting in quintuplets. I thought, "Man, this sounds really tricky, but no one would write a song based on groupings of quintuplets."

Turns out I was wrong. They actually did the entire cover using quintuplet-based polyrhythms. Basically, the 4/4 feel is actually based on 4 quintuplets over an underlying tempo. Check out this live performance of it:

Ridiculous.

They obviously have a sense of humor in that they've done over-the-top complicated covers of *The Simpsons* theme, Henry Mancini's *Pink Panther* theme, and Bill Medley/Jennifer Warnes' *Time of my Life* (that cheesy song from the 80s film *Dirty Dancing*). I bought all their albums in one evening and thought, "This is the kind of music I've been trying to make for years. Now I don't have to.

## Some bragging...

I'll brag just a little bit before wrapping up... I've gotten to know the drummer, Sebastian, and he played on one of my singles from 2013:
