## Who are The Residents?

Actually, no one really knows. But, here's a better answer: The Residents are an avant-garde art rock band that has been actively producing music, videos, and technology products since 1969. They have released several dozen albums and have never revealed their identities. Each release has been part of an â€œera" demonstrating some newly-developed form of musical terror. Honestly, I've never been scared listening to music except for a few songs by The Residents.

## Nice Video

Here is a nice video I made about The Residents.

## What Makes The Residents Weird?

They are most widely recognized by their signature eyeball heads with top hats.

Their music is, without a doubt, some of the strangest--and sometimes the most terrifying--music I've ever heard in my life. It's like listening to a terrible car crash; some people look away, some people are transfixed. People visiting this site are likely the kinds of people who become transfixed.

Their music videos are incredibly "out there." They've released computer games that are just so strange. Their live performances are eery and will give you the shivers. Their covers of familiar songs are nightmarish. There's just nothing normal about them.

Whether there has ever been a consistent lineup in the band is unknown. They have too many releases for me to list my favorite songs, so I'll just list some of my favorite albums of theirs.

## What you should listen to

- *[Duck Stab](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_Stab/Buster_%26_Glen)*
- *[Commercial Album](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Album)*
- *[George &amp; James](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_%26_James)*
- *[The King &amp; Eye](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_King_%26_Eye)*
- *[Freak Show](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freak_Show/Freak_Show_Soundtrack)*
- *[Animal Lover](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Lover)*

The first time I listened to *Animal Lover*, I literally sat with my jaw dropped and barely blinked. I remember playing the first track, *On the Way to Oklahoma*, and being absolutely stunned only to realize that my mouth had dried from my mouth hanging open for almost 40 minutes. Here's that opening track:

I was fortunate to see both their Talking Light and Wonder of Weird tours. Talking Light had moments so intense and terrifying, I almost started crying. It was one of the weirdest experiences of my life.

## What you should watch

Here's my favorite video of theirs. It's a song called *Hello Skinny* from the album *Duck Stab*. May it haunt you forever.
