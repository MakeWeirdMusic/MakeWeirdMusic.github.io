## Who am I?

That's kind of a deep question. I think the best answer is, "I'm just this guy, you know?"

The only way I could get my music written about was to start my own site. So here we are.

## What makes me weird?

I don't know. I run this site. That's weird, right?

Music has been one of the few consistent anchors in my life. My father was in a band throughout most of my childhood and many of his friends were musicians. I started learning drums and keyboard early on, then picked up the saxophone until I started playing guitar at the age of 14 or so.

Through a miraculous turn of events, I heard a [Steve Vai](/discover/steve-vai) song on the radio in 1996 and my life was forever changed. I bought his latest release at the time, *Alien Love Secrets*, and my father told me that his friend, John Sergio, had grown up with Steve and even introduced him to [Joe Satriani](http://satriani.com) when they were teenagers. We called John and ended up visiting Steve at his house weeks later in LA. A few years later, I ended up working for Steve as a studio and guitar technician for some time.

Working for Steve taught me so much about making weird music. While my father and his band influenced my foundational interest in weird music, working for a successful, professional musician was eye-opening. I could go on for pages and pages about what I learned.

I've worked on a few albums, none of them successful but some of them are good! I've helped a couple of indie rock bands with engineering and production, done a lot of [work with my father on most of his releases](https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/tony-garone/id4470162), and have released several albums and singles on my own. My most recent album, *10 Decent Pieces*, [is available on Carl King's online store](http://shop.carlkingdom.com/collections/digital-downloads/products/anthony-garone-10-decent-pieces).
