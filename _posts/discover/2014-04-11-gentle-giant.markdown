## Who was Gentle Giant?

Gentle Giant was a progressive rock band that was more influential than famous in its 10-year existence. Their multi-instrumental virtuosity, enthusiasm, and perfectionism made them a very powerful live act throughout the 1970s. Several videos of their performances have survived and [are available for purchase](http://www.gentlegiantmusic.com/). It is clear they were a formidable act to follow.

## How many instruments can one group of people play?!

The band rotated a few members, but the lineup with the greatest longevity included:

- [Derek Shulman](http://www.blazemonger.com/GG/Derek_Shulman): Lead vocals, saxophone, recorder, keyboards, bass, drums, percussion
- [Ray Shulman](http://www.blazemonger.com/GG/Ray_Shulman): Bass, trumpet, violin, vocals, viola, drums, percussion, recorder, guitar
- [Kerry Minnear](http://www.blazemonger.com/GG/Kerry_Minnear): Lead vocals, keyboards, cello, vibes, xylophone, recorder, guitar, bass, drums
- [Gary Green](http://www.blazemonger.com/GG/Gary_Green): Guitar, mandolin, vocals, recorder, bass, drums, xylophone

## How diverse can one group of people be?

They were also incredibly diverse in their musical style. They used [hockets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hocket), [vocal fugues](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugue), odd time signatures, elements of [medieval music](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_music) and modern blues/rock within the same song, tension, atonal harmony, and many other techniques that made their music weird.

## What you should listen to first

Some of my favorite songs include:

- *Wreck* and *The Moon is Down* from [Acquiring the Taste](http://www.blazemonger.com/GG/Acquiring_the_Taste)
- *Experience*, *The Runaway*, and *In a Glass House* from [In a Glass House](http://www.blazemonger.com/GG/In_a_Glass_House)
- Every song except *Valedictory* and *The Face* from [The Power and the Glory](http://www.blazemonger.com/GG/The_Power_and_the_Glory)
- *Design*, and *I Lost My Head* from [Interview](http://www.blazemonger.com/GG/Interview)
- The entirety of [Three Friends](http://www.blazemonger.com/GG/Three_Friends)
- *The Advent of Panurge*, *Raconteur Troubadour*, *Knots*, and *Think of Me with Kindness* from [Octopus](http://www.blazemonger.com/GG/Octopus)

## The Torch Still Burns

Two of the original members are keeping the band's music alive with live performances in a lineup called [Three Friends](http://threefriendsmusic.wordpress.com/). They are excellent! Check out this great performance of *Schooldays* from, also called *Three Friends*.

Gentle Giant is a big influence on many other interesting bands. There are several [tribute albums](http://www.blazemonger.com/GG/Discography#Tribute_Albums), one of which features this fantastic vocal fugue by [Kevin Gilbert](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Gilbert):

## Steven Wilson Remixes

In July 2014, Derek Shulman [interviewed with the Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mike-ragogna/a-conversation-with-cbs-t_b_5625701.html) (scroll to the middle of the long page) and announced the BluRay edition of *The Power and the Glory*. It is a little surreal reading about Gentle Giant in the news, but here we are. Anyway, the new releases are remixed and remastered by [Steven Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Wilson) of the band [Porcupine Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porcupine_Tree). He's also responsible for rereleases of several [King Crimson](/discover/king-crimson) and [Jethro Tull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jethro_Tull_(band)) classics. Very exciting news for weird music fans.

Just a few weeks earlier, [Derek did a longer interview with Hit Channel](http://www.hit-channel.com/interviewderek-shulman-gentle-giant/62545). Cool!
