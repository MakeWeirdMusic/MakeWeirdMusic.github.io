Special thanks to [Cory Berg at Software++](http://softwareplusplus.com) and to [Carl King Creative](http://carlkingdom.com) for sponsoring this interview.

Cory is a software development and management expert who's written a fantastic book called [Software++: Must-Have Skills for Engineers](http://www.amazon.com/Software-Must-Have-Skills-Engineers-ebook/dp/B00U4ZRQC6). There are a lot of software people I've met via Make Weird Music and Guitar Circle.

Carl is an expert filmmaker, author, and [former musician](/discover/carl-king). His book, [So, You're a Creative Genius... Now What?](http://www.amazon.com/Youre-Creative-Genius-Now-What/dp/1932907920), has been a huge inspiration for me and many others. He filmed this interview and provided lots of great equipment and expertise.

## A Little About Steve Vai

Steve Vai is a forward-thinking, virtuosic guitarist based in Los Angeles. He started his career in music with [Frank Zappa](/discover/frank-zappa) in 1979.

## What's So Weird?

A lot of Steve's work makes use of the following weird music techniques:

- Time Signatures
- Composition
- Virtuosity

## Why I Care

In 1996, I heard an instrumental guitar song on the radio (!!) that had the most incredible guitar playing I'd ever heard. It opened my eyes to new potential on the instrument and I had no idea that level of technicality, virtuosity, and musicality. The DJ said, "That was Steve Vai with his track *Juice* off his new album, *[Alien Love Secrets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_Love_Secrets)*." Immediately, I scrounged up all the cash and change I could, went to Best Buy (when they actually had a good selection of music for sale), and bought it for $9.99.

Little did I know, Steve Vai was--and still is--one of the most innovative, inspired, and ambitious guitarists in the industry. [Frank Zappa](/discover/frank-zappa) credited him with "impossible guitar parts" as the "stunt guitarist" of his band between 1980 and 1982. Between solo releases, he played with [Alcatrazz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcatrazz), [John Lydon/Johnny Rotten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lydon)'s [Public Image Ltd.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Image_Ltd), [David Lee Roth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lee_Roth), [Alice Cooper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Cooper), [Whitesnake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitesnake), and [Ozzy Osbourne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozzy_Osbourne).

His solo releases through the 1990s were mind-blowing. *[Passion and Warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passion_and_Warfare)*, *Alien Love Secrets*, and *[Fire Garden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Garden)* were in my CD player for months. I bought every used guitar magazine and tablature book I could find to learn those songs. There are enough weird music techniques in these albums for decades of worthwhile study.

Through Steve's music (especially sheet music), I learned an incredible amount about time signatures, composition, instrumentation, key modulations, humor, crossing multiple genres, experimentation, and virtuosity. He's been a huge inspiration to my own guitar and composition techniques.

Steve Vai has had a long, incredible history of trailblazing in the instrumental rock genre and he shows no sign of stopping. Every album features intricately planned and executed melodic explorations, rapid-fire blues-based riffage, and new sounds like you've never heard out of a guitar. His discography covers all sorts of ground from straightforward blues/rock to completely whacked-out alien noise.

## What You Should Hear First

If you've never listened to Steve, here's where to start:

- For groundbreaking guitar rock: *Passion and Warfare*
- For completely weird, Zappa-esque outlandishness: *[Flex-Able](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flex-Able)*
- For compositional complexity: *Fire Garden*

If you're looking for an album with one genre/version of Steve, you're not going to find it. He sticks to no particular genre and offers something for everyone. My favorite pieces of his are the extended-length exploratory pieces, like *Freak Show Excess*, *Fire Garden Suite*, *The Story of Light*, and *Lucky Charms*.

And if you're looking for something REALLY out there, check out his performance of *Fire Strings* with the Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra.
