Nora Germain is a multi-talented powerhouse of music, energy, and inspiration. She sings, she dances, she rips it up on the violin, she writes books, and more. I first heard about Nora through [Steve Ball](/discover/steve-ball) when he told me about her involvement in the [Tiny Orchestral Moments](/share/tiny-orchestral-moments) project. Steve got us in touch and we got this interview filmed in December 2017 while she was visiting Seattle.
