## Video

{% include video.html vid=page.youtube_id %}

IMPORTANT NOTE: When I say, "F#5," what I really mean is "F#sus4." Same for all the other "5" chords. I recorded the video pretty late and flipped my 4ths and 5ths. Didn't realize it until the next day. Oh well.

## Context

*Mental Medication* is one of my favorite songs from the incredible progressive rock album, U.K. It's a self-titled album and features incredible virtuosity by [Allan Holdsworth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Holdsworth), [Bill Bruford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Bruford), [John Wetton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wetton), and [Eddie Jobson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Jobson). It's a musical adventure and is so beautiful.

Check out this other really cool video with a transcription of one of the crazier parts of the song:
