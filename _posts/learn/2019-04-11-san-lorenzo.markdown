## Why This Song?

[Pat Metheny](http://patmetheny.com) is an incredible composer and guitarist. I absolutely love a lot of his work (some I definitely don't!).

I was asked if I would perform this song with my friend Jonathan Sindelman for his opening act when MWM brought [Nik BÃ¤rtsch](/concert/nik-baertsch) to Arizona in March 2019. Learning a Pat song sounded fun and interesting. Little did I know what I was getting myself into!

**[Purchase Pat Metheny's San Lorenzo on Apple Music&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-apple" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/san-lorenzo/83913842?i=83913844)**

This is not an easy song to learn. First of all, you need a 12-string electric guitar. Second, you need to play in a non-standard tuning (shouldn't be a surprise to Pat fans). Third, the non-standard tuning requires a set of custom strings that are all plain steel, except for one. Crazy! Here are the details on the tuning, courtesy of YouTube commenter David Kean:

Low to high!<br />
Eb3 .021w/Bb3 .013   5th<br />
F3 .018 /C4 .012   5th<br />
Ab3 .015 /Eb4 .010   5th<br />
Bb3 .013 /F4 .009   5th<br />
C4 .012  /G4 .008    5th<br />
F4 .009/F4 .009   Unison

There's no good video of this song on YouTube, so I had to figure it all out by ear. The sheet music wasn't of much help, either, because the tuning is non-standard, so learning how to read the sheet music in this tuning was like learning a new instrument. While I know I am not playing what Pat plays, this is a good "fake" playthrough that'll accompany the track well.
