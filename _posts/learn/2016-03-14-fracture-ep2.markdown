## Episode 2: Picking the Right Pick

Ten years ago (almost to the day!), [Robert Fripp paid me a compliment in his online diary](https://www.dgmlive.com/diaries.htm?entry=3463) in response to videos and blog posts I'd written at that time about playing *Fracture*. He said, "Mr. Garone's work on this is honourable, and has my respect." This sentence motivated me for many years to continue pursuing *Fracture*.

More importantly, he made a recommendation that, for some reason, took me years to understand: use a sharp pick.

## Picks, Picks, Picks!

When Mr. Fripp recommended use of a sharp pick, he wrote:

> The recommended pick is [a triangular Guitar Craft pick](http://www.guitarcraftguitars.com/picks.html), of which there is a small production line, handmade in Japan by Mr. Hiroshi Iketani. If a Dunlop Tortex is the only choice, I would use the Tortex Sharp & consider that life was hard, cruel & unfair.

Since I had no access to the triangular Guitar Craft pick at the time, I bought [Dunlop Tortex Sharps](http://www.amazon.com/Dunlop-412P1-0-Tortex%C2%AE-Sharp-Players/dp/B000PTRJW8) and it made a *huge* difference in tone and accuracy. (I prefer the yellow .73mm ones.) Here's what I love about them:

- They make your strings sound *much* brighter and more clear
- Pick noise is severely reduced
- They're slightly longer than a normal pick, so there's more to grip
- Reduces accidental string muting
- Sounds much more like Fripp!

Using a normal pick makes it harder to play *Fracture* for the reasons I just listed. Normal picks don't have the clear tone of a sharp pick. They're noisy and make a lot of noise because you're almost always rubbing the surface of the pick across a string instead of striking through a string. They're shorter and not as grippy. Their shortness also makes it hard to let long notes ring during the "death picking" part of *Fracture*. And if you're really trying to play like Fripp and sound like him, you're not going to have good luck with a normal pick.

### Guitar Craft Triangular Picks
When I attended the Guitar Circle intro course, some official india rubber Guitar Craft picks were available for purchase. It turns out there are two types of GC picks: [india rubber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_rubber) and [delrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyoxymethylene). My india rubber picks are shiny, slick, and fancier than the delrin ones. The delrin ones have a matte, fine texture and I prefer them to the india rubber ones. Guitarist [Steve Ball](http://www.steveball.com/index.htm) has [a written history of the picks on his website](http://www.steveball.com/words/history/PickHistory/).

These picks are definitely, definitely awesome. Before I had any access to these picks, I bought every sharp pick I could find on the market. The only ones that even come close to the GC picks are the Tortex Sharps Fripp recommended. The biggest advantage (for me) to the triangular pick is that it doesn't spin or move nearly as much when playing *Fracture*.

### Other Sharp Picks
Now, I understand that it may be my own poor technique that leads to a spinning pick, but I can say that the triangular pick spins the least of any of the picks I've seen. Even as I've been making this series, I've worked pretty hard on my picking grip and have started re-evaluating other sharp picks as I'm learning to better control the pick.

Despite all this work, none of the other sharp picks I have come *close* to the Tortex Sharps or the GC picks:

- [White Dunlop Jazz III picks](http://www.amazon.com/Jim-Dunlop-478P-88-Tortex®-Players/dp/B00ISQCJRU) are the best of the rest. For GC-style picking that's suitable for playing *Fracture*, these are pretty nice, though a little thick for my taste. The other Jazz III picks are just too thick for me.
- [Dunlop Ultex Sharp picks](http://www.amazon.com/Dunlop-433P-73-Ultex®-Sharp-Players/dp/B002IJK0H4) are fairly nice, but not nearly as "sharp" as the Tortex Sharps. I've found the curve near the point of the pick
- [D'Andrea triangle picks](http://www.amazon.com/DAndrea-TG355-96HV-Celluloid-Guitar/dp/B001RMDQCY) are really big. I've thought about cutting them down to the size of the GC picks, but then one of the sides would be unfinished and I don't really think it's worth it. Plus, the point isn't very sharp.
- [Ibanez Steve Vai rubber grip picks](http://www.amazon.com/Ibanez-Steve-Signature-Rubber-6-Pack/dp/B004CYEPD8) are pretty nice picks overall, actually.

While we're on the subject of picks, there are some pretty crazy picks out there. [Ibanez makes one with a sandpaper grip](http://www.amazon.com/Ibanez-0-75mm-Sand-Grip-Plectrums/dp/B004CYEPGU)! I just ordered this crazy [V-Pick "Shredder Lite" triangular guitar pick](https://www.v-picks.com/product/shredder-lite/). We'll see how that goes.
