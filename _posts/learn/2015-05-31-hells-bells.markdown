Let&#8217;s pick apart the catchy hook from the song <em>Hell&#8217;s Bells</em> off the 1979 release <em>One of a Kind</em> by the fusion/rock band, <a href="/discover/bruford">Bruford</a>. (NOTE: It is not a cover of the AC/DC song with the same name! At least, I don&#8217;t think it is.) It features Allan Holdsworth on guitar, Jeff Berlin on bass, Dave Stewart on keyboards, and Bill Bruford on drums. The song&#8217;s intro alone contains odd [time signatures](http://makeweirdmusic.com/techniques/time-signatures) and [key modulations](http://makeweirdmusic.com/techniques/key-modulations) that make it an interesting topic worthy of study.

![A section: 19/8 = 7/8 + 7/8 + 5/8](https://rawgit.com/MakeWeirdMusic/art/master/bill-bruford/hells-bells/hells-bells-slide-time-signatures-section-A-1067x600.png)

What this means is each phrase is 19 beats (eighth notes/quavers) composed of a bar of 7, a bar of 7, and a bar of 5.

![B section: 19/8 = 4/8 + 4/8 + 4/8 + 4/8 + 3/8](https://rawgit.com/MakeWeirdMusic/art/master/bill-bruford/hells-bells/hells-bells-slide-time-signatures-section-B-1067x600.png)

This section starts with the Gb chord (fingers in the section below) and ends with the Am7.

![C section: 19/8 ¿ 11.3/9 ≥ 17/3 ? (It's a joke)](https://rawgit.com/MakeWeirdMusic/art/master/bill-bruford/hells-bells/hells-bells-slide-time-signatures-section-C-1067x600.png)

<strong>Just kidding on that last one&#8230;</strong>

I highly recommend [watching the video](https://youtu.be/wNCSTNHejAY) above to make sure you hear me play through each section and you can count it out yourself.

Obviously, this song makes use of odd <a href="http://makeweirdmusic.com/techniques/time-signatures">time signatures</a>, but what may not be obvious by glancing at the chords is that it also employs regular <a href="http://makeweirdmusic.com/techniques/key-modulations">key modulations</a>. What I find most interesting about the key modulations is the keys change between Bb major and E major, two notes that form <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tritone">a &#8220;tritone&#8221; interval relationship</a> that sound pretty ugly when played together.

Here are the chords and fingerings:

There are several brave souls who&#8217;ve recorded covers of &#8220;Hell&#8217;s Bells&#8221; on youtube, often of varying quality. The song is quite complex and was proven to be a challenge even for Mike Portnoy, Billy Sheehan, Derek Sherinian, and Tony MacAlpine! (Skip to 1:50 to check it out)
