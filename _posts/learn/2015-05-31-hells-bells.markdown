## What are we learning?

Let's pick apart the catchy hook from the song *Hell's Bells* off the 1979 release *One of a Kind* by the fusion/rock band, [Bruford](/discover/bruford). (NOTE: It is not a cover of the AC/DC song with the same name... I think?) It features Allan Holdsworth on guitar, Jeff Berlin on bass, Dave Stewart on keyboards, and Bill Bruford on drums. The song's intro alone contains odd [time signatures](/techniques/time-signatures) and [key modulations](/techniques/key-modulations) that make it weird.

## Instructional Video

I've put together an instructional video that illustrates everything in the charts below. Watch that if, like me, you don't like reading.

## Time Signatures

The time signatures in this song are ridiculous. It took me a long time to figure the signatures out, then it took me even longer to believe they were correct!

![A section: 19/8 = 7/8 + 7/8 + 5/8]({% if jekyll.environment == "production" %}{{ site.data.artists.mwm.art_prod }}/bill-bruford/hells-bells/hells-bells-slide-time-signatures-section-A-1067x600.png){% else %}{{ site.data.artists.mwm.art_dev }}/bill-bruford/hells-bells/hells-bells-slide-time-signatures-section-A-1067x600.png){% endif %}

What this means is each phrase is 19 beats (eighth notes/quavers) composed of a bar of 7, a bar of 7, and a bar of 5.

![B section: 19/8 = 4/8 + 4/8 + 4/8 + 4/8 + 3/8]({% if jekyll.environment == "production" %}{{ site.data.artists.mwm.art_prod }}bill-bruford/hells-bells/hells-bells-slide-time-signatures-section-B-1067x600.png){% else %}{{ site.data.artists.mwm.art_dev }}bill-bruford/hells-bells/hells-bells-slide-time-signatures-section-B-1067x600.png){% endif %}

This section starts with the Gb chord (fingers in the section below) and ends with the Am7.

![C section: 19/8 ¿ 11.3/9 ≥ 17/3 ? (It's a joke)]({% if jekyll.environment == "production" %}{{ site.data.artists.mwm.art_prod }}bill-bruford/hells-bells/hells-bells-slide-time-signatures-section-C-1067x600.png){% else %}{{ site.data.artists.mwm.art_dev }}bill-bruford/hells-bells/hells-bells-slide-time-signatures-section-C-1067x600.png){% endif %}

<strong>Just kidding on that last one&#8230;</strong>

I highly recommend [watching the video](https://youtu.be/wNCSTNHejAY) above to make sure you hear me play through each section and you can count it out yourself.

## Chords

Obviously, this song makes use of odd <a href="http://makeweirdmusic.com/techniques/time-signatures">time signatures</a>, but what may not be obvious by glancing at the chords is that it also employs regular <a href="http://makeweirdmusic.com/techniques/key-modulations">key modulations</a>. What I find most interesting about the key modulations is the keys change between Bb major and E major, two notes that form <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tritone">a &#8220;tritone&#8221; interval relationship</a> that sound pretty ugly when played together.

Here are the chords and fingerings:

<pre class="tab">      BbM7add2   Bb2      Gb      Fm7    Cadd2/E     C        Am7

## This Stuff Ain't Easy, Folks!

There are several brave souls who've recorded covers of &#8220;Hell's Bells&#8221; on youtube, often of varying quality. The song is quite complex and was proven to be a challenge even for Mike Portnoy, Billy Sheehan, Derek Sherinian, and Tony MacAlpine! (Skip to 1:50 to check it out)

Should you find yourself learning this song, let me know! I'd love to hear it!!
