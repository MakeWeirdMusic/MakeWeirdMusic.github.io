Thanks to [Gabriel Lucas Riccio&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>](http://thegabrielconstruct.com) for his help with this transcription.

## Context

[Henry Cow&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cow)'s [*Western Culture*&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Culture_(album)) is one of my favorite records, if not my absolute favorite record ever. It's extremely challenging for the first several listens. Like [Harold Bloom&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Bloom)'s first attempts at reading [Cormac McCarthy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cormac_McCarthy)'s [*Blood Meridian*&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_Meridian) where he threw the book across the room three times before he could finish it, this album was unlistenable noise to me for many years.

Once I started to understand [motivic composition&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motif_(music)), I began to understand this record and appreciate its beauty.

Anyway, I've wanted to transcribe this piece for a long time and the idea had been eating away at me for the past few weeks, so here we are. There are lots of tricks to playing it, so make sure you listen to the original recording before you try playing through the transcription.

Based on the feedback I got when I posted this video, there's more demand for Henry Cow transcriptions than I ever thought imaginable. If you'd like to see more, let me know!
