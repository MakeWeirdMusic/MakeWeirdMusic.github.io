## Help Keep It Weird!

So, I'm just one person and this is a part-time effort for me. I need help! Forrealz!

## Share our Content!

The easiest way to support the site is to **share the content**. Clicking "Share" is super-easy and meaningful. Spread the word!

{% include mailchimp.html %}

## Buy a Shirt

<a href="/shirts">We've got shirts for $20 apiece (plus shipping)!</a> They're beautiful and wonderful and cool! Use the email link below and let me know if you want one (please include your size and shipping address).

## Donate Content or Money

This site has been way more successful than I ever expected. It's also cost me much more than I ever expected!

If you find value in the site, please consider donating money, code, artwork, or written content. Anything donated will go directly toward the site and *not* into my pocket.

## Sponsorship, Lessons, and More!
