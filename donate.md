## Help Keep It Weird!

So, this is the awkward page where I ask you for help. This site has been way more successful than I ever expected. It's also cost me much more than I ever expected!

If you find value in the site, please consider donating money or content. Anything donated will go directly toward funding the site.

<a href="http://paypal.me/MakeWeirdMusic" class="donation-icon"><i class="fa fa-paypal"></i> Donate via Paypal</a>

<a class="donation-icon" href="http://cash.me/$MakeWeirdMusic"><i class="fa fa-square"></i> Donate via Square Cash</a>

<a class="donation-icon" href="http://github.com/MakeWeirdMusic"><i class="fa fa-github-square"></i> Donate code and art via GitHub</a>

## Sponsorship, Lessons, and More!

If you'd like to sponsor a post, interview, video series, etc. let me know! If you're interested in guitar lessons, music production ideas, or a review/analysis of your music, I'm happy to do that in exchange for a donation to the site.
