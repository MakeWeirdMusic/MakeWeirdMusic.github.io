So, this is the awkward page where I ask you for money (or anything else that'll help me keep the site going). This is really out of character for me and I don't really like the idea of it, but hear me out for a second.

This site has kind of blown up into something with bigger opportunities than I ever imagined and those opportunities cost way more money than I would have imagined. For example, recording quality video for interviews with Steve Vai and Mike Keneally costs several hundred dollars, not including travel expenses, hardware, and time.

If you find value in the site, please consider donating money or content to the site. You can donate money via [Square Cash](http://cash.me/$MakeWeirdMusic) or [PayPal](http://paypal.me/MakeWeirdMusic).

If you're interested in guitar lessons or music production ideas or a review/analysis of your music, I'm happy to do that in exchange for a donation to the site. I do not ever plan to turn a profit through this site and all the money donated will go straight back into the site in some form.

So send me an email at anthony@makeweirdmusic.com if you have any questions or if you'd like to contribute in any other way to the site (sponsorship, hardware, content, ideas, etc.).

Thank you so much for visiting! Please reach out on [facebook](http://facebook.com/MakeWeirdMusic) or [twitter](http://twitter.com/MakeWeirdMusic) and start a conversation!
