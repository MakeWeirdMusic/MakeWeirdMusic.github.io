## Welcome

<div class="video-wrapper"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bx1ebnUvwbs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

Welcome to Make Weird Music! Thanks for visiting! My name is [Anthony Garone](/discover/anthony-garone) and this site is my zero-profit passion project. I've been playing guitar since 1996 and have been listening to lots of weird music thanks to my father's record and tape collection, which consisted of bands like [Gentle Giant](/discover/gentle-giant), [Frank Zappa](/discover/frank-zappa), [King Crimson](/discover/king-crimson), and other cool stuff.

## Why does this site exist?

Here's [a presentation I delivered](/share/ignite-phoenix/) as part of an event called [Ignite Phoenix&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm far fa-external-link-square"></i>](http://www.ignitephoenix.com/), where I explained the origin of the site and how it's changed my life:

<div class="video-wrapper"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YKqre-waCI8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

Between the ages of 15 and 22, I was convinced I'd become a professional musician. Working in the music industry for a year helped me realize how unlikely that'd be. [My old website&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm far fa-external-link-square"></i>](http://garone.org) and [old YouTube account&nbsp;<i class="non-mwm far fa-external-link-square"></i>](http://youtube.com/agarone) helped me develop an audience of like-minded music enthusiasts while earning a living as a software developer.

Make Weird Music rose from my desire to produce content about music without making myself the focal point. The site has been more successful than I ever imagined after starting it in early 2014! It has led to relationships with people all over the world and brought me amazing opportunities to interview great musicians.

"Weird music" doesn't have to be unenjoyable, but it should be interesting! Radiohead is very popular and very weird. Dirty Loops does virtuosic covers of Justin Bieber and Britney Spears music. [Avishai Cohen](/discover/avishai-cohen) makes music that even my wife can enjoy. Being "weird" should indicate an effort to go against the grain a little bit and express your individuality.

## Who is this site for?

This site is probably targeted toward musicians looking for something different. Ultimately, the site is for me as I learn and grow as a musician. Thanks for joining me on this journey!
