Welcome to Make Weird Music! Thanks for visiting! My name is [Anthony Garone](/discover/anthony-garone) and I run this site as a passion project. I've been playing guitar since 1996 and have been listening to lots of weird music thanks to my father's record and tape collection, which consisted of bands like [Gentle Giant](/discover/gentle-giant), [Frank Zappa](/discover/frank-zappa), [King Crimson](/discover/king-crimson), and other progressive rock bands.

Between the ages of 15 and 22, I was convinced I'd become a professional musician. Working in the music industry helped me realize the extremely low probability of making a decent living as a weird musician. The technology industry and its payscale seemed more realistic to fulfill my lifelong goals of having a family, a home, etc. [My old website](http://garone.org) and [old YouTube account](http://youtube.com/agarone) helped me develop an audience of like-minded music enthusiasts, but I grew completely uninterested in featuring myself as the content.

The idea of Make Weird Music rose from my desire to continue to produce content about music without making myself the focal point. It turns out that people all over the world resonate with the idea of making weird music and I've gotten great opportunities to meet people all over the world to talk about it. No one could ever have convinced me I would get as much out of this site as I have since it started in early 2014.

## What is "Weird Music?"

Weird music doesn't have to be unenjoyable or especially unconventional, but it should be interesting! Some pop songs are "weird" and popular. Bands like Radiohead are mainstream despite their minimalistic instrumentation and arrangements. Bands like Dirty Loops can cover Justin Bieber and make the songs fun and virtuosic. Jazz musicians like [Avishai Cohen](/discover/avishai-cohen) make music that even my wife can enjoy while still satisfying my intellectual desire for interesting music. Ultimately, being "weird" should indicate some effort to go against the grain a little bit and express your individuality.

## Who is this site for?

This site is probably targeted toward musicians and uses lots of pseudo-technical musical jargon. I have never formally studied music and am primarily self-taught, so this site explores lots of concepts that are new to me. If I'm saying or expressing something incorrectly, let me know!
