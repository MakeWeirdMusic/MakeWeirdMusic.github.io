## Elevating Ideas

Will Mejia is one of the best designers in the Phoenix, Arizona area and the owner of [Elevating Ideas](http://elevatingideas.com). He designed the MWM brand/identity, color palette, social icons, etc. We work together at [meltmedia](http://meltmedia.com), where he is the Director of Design. Apart from being incredibly talented, he is also a super-nice and generous guy who has done so much for this site. Thank you, Will!

## Software++

Cory Berg is a software development expert, weightlifter, guitarist, and author based in Chandler, Arizona. He runs a fantastic technology blog called [Software++](http://softwareplusplus.com) and wrote a book called *[Software++: Must-Have Skills for Software Engineers](http://www.amazon.com/Software-Must-Have-Skills-Engineers-ebook/dp/B00U4ZRQC6/)* that's really great. Many people who visit Make Weird Music are in the software development industry, so there's a good chance you'll find the book and blog handy.

## Mad Hatter Guitar Products

Ed Heisler is the owner and engineer behind [Mad Hatter Guitar Products](http://madhatterguitarproducts.com) based in Scottsdale, Arizona. has developed an innovative solderless guitar electronics kit that will make your guitar sound incredible. Most guitar manufacturers use cheap, crappy electronic components and the components Ed has put together for his kits are super-duper high quality. I'm not a tone nerd or anything, but I was *stunned* when I heard my 1997 Ibanez Jem after we put in the new components.

Do yourself a favor and purchase one of his [Mad Hatter Solderless Tone Shaping System Kits](http://madhatterguitarproducts.com/pages/mad-hatter-solderless-tone-shaping-system-kits).

## Carl King Creative

Carl King is a musician, author, and filmmaker based in Los Angeles, California. He is unbelievably talented, super smart, and runs [Carl King Creative](http://carlkingdom.com). He filmed the [Steve Vai interview](/interview/steve-vai) and [Mike Keneally interview](/interview/mike-keneally). His book, *So, You're a Creative Genius... Now What?*, has been hugely influential for me. If you're a creative person, check it out!

## meltmedia
