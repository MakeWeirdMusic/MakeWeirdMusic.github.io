&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-failure-to-fracture&quot;&gt;What is &lt;em&gt;Failure to Fracture&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/learn/fracture&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Failure to Fracture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a video series I’ve put together about all the things that have stood in the way of my successfully playing the song &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/king-crimson&quot;&gt;King Crimson&lt;/a&gt; despite years and years of study, practice, writing, and making videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;22-years-in-the-making&quot;&gt;22 Years in the Making&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;/learn/fracture&quot;&gt;Failure to Fracture&lt;/a&gt; series is much, much more popular than I ever expected. When I started Make Weird Music, I thought, “If I ever get 250 subscribers, this will be a huge success.” Well, here we are 6 years later and there are over 8,000 YouTube subscribers and my Fracture videos have accumulated over 100,000 views. That is a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; way above 250 people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late February, I started writing my thoughts on Fracture and then it turned into a book within a few weeks. I made a teaser video after I finished writing all the book content. I hope you enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book is YUGE. And it’s going to be so beautiful!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also preparing to release “final” performance videos of Fracture and FraKctured alongside the book. Here are some of my latest practice runs.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Clueless at The Work by Anthony Garone</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-book-for-all-sorts&quot;&gt;A book for all sorts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ad&quot;&gt;Buy Anthony Garone’s book, &lt;a href=&quot;http://cluelessatthework.com&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clueless at The Work: Advice from a Corporate Tyrant&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, published by &lt;a href=&quot;https://stairwaypress.com&quot;&gt;Stairway Press&lt;/a&gt;. Available on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Clueless-Work-Advice-Corporate-Tyrant/dp/1949267296&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/clueless-at-the-work-anthony-garone/1133915699&quot;&gt;Barnes &amp;amp; Noble&lt;/a&gt;, and other online retailers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I’m not doing Make Weird Music or with my family, you’ll find me working at &lt;a href=&quot;http://garone.org&quot;&gt;my day job&lt;/a&gt;, advising technology startup companies, working with local colleges and universities, and more. I’m a productive person and I enjoy working. A lot of people ask me, “How do you get so much done?” In fact, so many people have asked me over the years, I thought I’d write about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of what I’ve written comes from lessons I’ve learned through Steve Vai, Robert Fripp, mindfulness, and lots of reading. The purpose of the book&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is an excerpt from the book:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In any profession, 90% of people are clueless but work by situational imitation, narrow mimicry &amp;amp; semi-conscious role-playing. Except social “science” and journalism where it is 99% and 100%, respectively. — &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/942367860709609472&quot;&gt;Nassim Taleb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t know I was clueless until a conversation with acclaimed guitarist &lt;a href=&quot;http://vai.com/&quot;&gt;Steve Vai&lt;/a&gt; on September 29, 2014. Steve introduced me to the transformational power of mindfulness. His life had changed through learning to be present in every moment, a practice developed in meditation. The concepts were so far beyond my understanding and capability, I just pretended to know what he was talking about. I was clueless. I didn’t actually see the depths of my cluelessness until a rude awakening six months later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2015, I was in Tepoztlán, Mexico with &lt;a href=&quot;http://dgmlive.com&quot;&gt;Robert Fripp&lt;/a&gt;, another world-renowned guitarist and composer. I was attending his week-long introductory course about music and the guitar. A few days in, Robert spoke at length about connecting our bodies, minds, and instruments with the present moment. He emphasized the importance of training our bodies to be still, appreciating silence, identifying musical opportunities, and self- control. I listened and nodded intently while mindlessly bouncing my right leg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, Robert said, “Everyone look at Anthony bouncing his leg for reasons he cannot even begin to describe. Is he controlling his body or is it the other way ‘round?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole class turned to look at me and my leg. My brain began processing this unexpected moment of humiliation. I was desperately searching for a witty comeback to deflect and defend my injured ego. Everyone laughed and Robert smiled at me. I decided to say nothing, laugh at myself, and pretend I was fine. It’s better to play it cool and take it in stride, right? It took a few minutes to get my blood pressure and heartrate back to normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I had one of those “a-ha” moments. My brain was flooded with memories of Steve talking about mindfulness. I heard his voice in my head saying, “Being present in the moment means having full acceptance of who you are and what is happening around you. Do you see these flowers in front of us? They’re not pretending to be anything other than what they are right now.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt both gratitude and nausea as I began to recognize my cluelessness. I was grateful that two of my biggest musical heroes had personally shared priceless, life-changing wisdom with me. I felt nauseous because I was acting like a hypocrite. Instead of digesting and practicing what my heroes had shared with me, I nodded my head, acted like I knew what I was talking about, and pretended to be someone I wasn’t. Robert saw right through this and I became the perfect example of mindlessness for the class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My brief moment of embarrassment led to a much greater realization. I had spent 33 years of my life learning how to appear successful to the world through “situational imitation, narrow mimicry, and semi-conscious role-playing.” I had no idea how to respond to my cluelessness or how to fix it. Yikes. It was time to change, quit acting, and start authoring my own life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve’s gift of knowledge and Robert’s gift of feedback helped me to start living life more earnestly, authentically, and humbly. I began studying every aspect of my own behavior and with great scrutiny. I learned to sit still, quiet my mind, and be comfortable with extended periods of silence. My relationships changed. My control over my body improved. My awareness of thoughts and mental habits changed. And for the first time in my life, I started feeling a calm confidence in my capabilities while being tested by life’s challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For 33 years, I represented the cluelessness described in Nassim Taleb’ s quote on page 1. Though my cluelessness was revealed to me through musical practice, I learned that I was just as clueless in my professional work life. I’ll share dozens of stories about that in the following pages. Addressing my cluelessness has meant spending the last several years voraciously reading, observing and analyzing my behaviors, having in-depth conversations with mentors, practicing what I preach, putting my skin in the game, and failing. Through this work, I have developed the invaluable skill of knowing when I actually am clueless and sensing when I probably am not. I now feel as though a veil has been lifted from my eyes and I’m able to see myself and the world much more clearly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for Taleb’s “90% of people are clueless” bit, I’ve since seen plenty of that in my own work experience and personal history. From CEOs who can’t make decisions until they’ve met with some advisory group to fresh-outta-college young people in their first real jobs, many people just don’t know how to succeed in their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People unfamiliar with Taleb are likely to misunderstand his words. He does not believe people are stupid idiots living with their heads where the sun don’t shine. He does, however, hold people accountable for their beliefs and is quick to call out their hypocrisy, especially if those people put themselves in positions of authority. Having read all of his books, nearly every tweet over the last few years, and watched every speech of his on YouTube, I think he’s largely misunderstood. There’s a big difference between believing people are idiots and telling people they are acting like idiots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are “clueless” and “work by situational imitation, narrow mimicry, &amp;amp; semi-conscious role-playing” because they simply don’t know any better. Schools don’t teach us how to succeed. They teach us how to be good at school. I’ve mentored and coached C-suite executives, departmental leaders, line managers, and individual contributors who’ve all suffered from these (and other) symptoms of cluelessness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most of these coaching conversations, it’s clear they haven’t augmented their real life experience with honest discussion, meaningful books, community participation, or failure. They often haven’t sought out help before. They do well enough in one job, move up the ladder, apply for and get other jobs with increasingly longer titles and higher pay, and eventually find themselves in jobs that no longer make sense to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taleb wrote a chapter in his book Skin in the Game about a type of person he calls Intellectual Yet Idiot, or IYI. The chapter is available to read for free online and I highly encourage you to check it out. Read it from top to bottom, and don’t stop when you find yourself offended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main point is: he has no tolerance or respect for armchair experts who make decisions for other people while keeping all the upside and transferring the downside to others. Once you grok his message, you start seeing it everywhere you go. Bureaucratic and political managers at work who don’t seem to do or know anything, but never get fired. Family members with pot bellies giving diet and nutrition advice to others. “Entrepreneurs” who never started their own businesses and bought their way into leadership positions. Cluelessness everywhere you look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there are a lot of IYIs. They often enjoy positions of high status and visibility, never getting their hands dirty with real work. They somehow manage to have high salaries and get to decide who to fire when the revenue is running dry. They get undeserved bonuses during economic downturns. They have corner offices and no discernible relationships with people “in the trenches.” They provide drive-by decisions in meetings, take conversations off the rails, and leave teams unnecessarily bewildered. They go back to school when they are bored in their careers. They think education will close the gap between the current and desired circumstances, all the while believing they have a clue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They want to change the world, but they can’t even keep their bedrooms clean and their beds made. They rarely have original ideas. While they aren’t the entirety of the 90% (and they couldn’t be or else the world would fall apart), they’re probably a decent chunk of that 90%. I certainly don’t want to be part of the 90%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This transcript is in progress. Here’s the first 16 minutes…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Drumroll. Laughter.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Paul Sears is a drummer who has a really crazy history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PS: Fact!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: And he has detailed a lot of amazing stories about his career in his new book. It’s called Angels &amp;amp; Demons. It’s published by Stairway Press.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PS: Angels &amp;amp; Demons That Play!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Angels &amp;amp; Demons That Play! Yes. So, it’s a new book on Stairway Press. It’s a really great book. I’ve known Paul a few years now. We met on Craigslist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PS: 2011?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah, something like that. I knew you were an amazing drummer, but I didn’t know that you could write! This is a great book, man! [Laughs.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PS: Good. I’m glad you liked it. It was a real chew to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PS: I’ve always liked to talk. I’ve had the gift of gab. Basically what that book is is me gabbing and writing it down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah. Well, it’s funny because as I was reading it, I could hear you speaking. I read this whole book in your voice. And it’s very clearly your voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PS: And you didn’t go insane?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: No, I didn’t. Before we got too deep into that, for people who don’t know much about you or your history, why don’t you share some of the major highlights of bands you’ve been in and work you’ve done?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PS: Well, for most of 40 years, I was in a group called The Muffins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Walking the Duck excerpt]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PS: Based in Washington, DC and we started a home-grown record label back in the 70s. The Muffins were, oh gosh, probably the 5th or 6th band that I was in. I joined up with a group of people, The Muffins, who were amazingly the only people in that area, or anywhere that I had run into at that time at the young age of 22, that were into the Virgin Records and the European progressive rock scene. Henry Cow, Fred Frith, Gong, yada yada yada, and they were the only people that I had ever met in my life that were into that sort of scene and listened to that kind of music. So, it was like a ready-made club. We got on really, really great and made a splash in the 70s and we lasted until 1981. Our last album then during the Mark II phase was with Fred Frith and that’s actually resulted in my favorite record of ours ever, which is 185.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: It’s right there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PS: All right. That’s the only record that we made after a tour where we really knew the music when we walked into the studio. We knocked that thing out in two days of recording, three days of assembly and mixing, and then off to New York for mastering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Is that the record where in the book you share a story about doubling your drum part and it was so precise…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PS: Not me, not me. It was Tom Scott’s saxophone part. It was the alto solo that’s in The Antidote to Dry-Dock tune. He had played that solo the same way for so long it became a part and it’s pretty insane solo. It’s probably 20 seconds long, if that, but listen to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Antidote to Dry-Dock excerpt]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: I did today before you came over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PS: After Tom played that, the engineer and Fred were having a chuckle and said, “Wow. Bet you can’t do that again.” And Tom said, “Take the first track out and give me another track.” And I thought those gentlemen were going to wet their pants because it was so spot-on, you can’t tell it’s two saxophones. But we knew our parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: So after 185…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PS: After 185, The Muffins sort of ennui set in. A couple of these guys were starting families and so the band drifted apart. Billy and I kept the house for about another year and then he started a family. My dad got ill. He was diagnosed with stomach cancer, so I moved home to help with family and not much music happened of any organized fashion until the very late 80s when I went to see a dear friend of mine’s group, the Teresa Gunn Band. Great group from the Washington area. She had an amazing bass player. He was playing far beyond what the music needed. He was really quite the hambone. This was a guy named Mark Smoot. I decided, “Teresa, I just might swipe your bass player.” So in between sets, I got to talk to him and found out that he was not only a Muffins fan, but a fan of all the other stuff that we all shared in common with The Muffins. So, he and I played together for about a month, just the two of us improvising and building on systems, then we built a band called Chainsaw Jazz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Chainsaw Jazz excerpt]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: And then you got back together with The Muffins…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PS: Well that… gosh [whistles]. Long time there. Back when the web became publicly available, I jumped on it and, just for spits and giggles, I started looking around for The Muffins and I’m like, “Wow! There’s a page here about The Muffins on some newsgroup.” So I’d print it out. And then about three weeks later, I had filled up a notebook that fat with stuff people had been writing about The Muffins on the web, on various newsgroups, like alt.music.progressive, whatever it was back then in the early 90s. And so there was so much written about us, I got a bug up my butt to try to get the band back together. Nobody had any real confidence in that ever happening, but in 1998, while I was working with another group, 9353, I found the stars aligned and I had accumulated enough evidence to present to the guys that, “Hey! You’ve all had your families and paid your mortgages and all this neat stuff. You want to play some music again?” And, lo and behold, they did. So we had another run from 1998 that lasted until 2016, or 2015-2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Right, and you released the Live at Orion DVD, which I’ve got right there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PS: That was done in 2002 at Orion Sound Studios with the help of several of our friends. Tom–this is an amazing thing for you techno people out there–Tom Scott put together that DVD, edited it all together, rendered it, did everything on a Windows 98 DOS computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Laughter.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PS: I think it took him 72 hours to render it or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: All right, I’ve gotta watch it again with this new appreciation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Maya excerpt from Live at Orion DVD]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PS: So that’s pretty cool. And then we made several more albums after that. We went to Italy and we went to France and did not see the Queen’s underpants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: [Laughs.] Alright, so you as a drummer, you’re one of the most powerful drummer I’ve ever heard play a kit. One of the things that astounded me so much about your playing is your ability to compose parts when the music may be so “off.” You know, like there’s just so little to grasp onto rhythmically or melodically, but somehow your parts unify everything. So I wanted to get a sense of where you’re coming from as a listener and as a musician and how do you view the drums compositionally in the context of a group like The Muffins?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PS: Well, two things come into play. One, I’ve been playing with other warm bodies in bands since 1967. So, I’ve got a lot of experience. I grew up with a lot of music that the 70s progressive-style bands were borrowing, so when I would hear Frank Zappa or Renaissance or Genesis or somebody, I’d go, “Oh, that’s Stravinsky. That’s Polank. That’s Jahanna Lane. That’s whatever.” So I had all this music in my brain thanks to my dad ever since I was a little kid. Improvising, I never really did until 1972. I was working with a very fine piano player named Steve Freeman. I have no idea where he is these days. He played grand piano and a Rhodes, but he preferred to play his Yamaha grand that he had in his apartment. He and I had jammed and he said to me, “One day, bring your drumset over to my house and we’re going to just do an improvisation. Just grand piano and the drums.” And it was one of the most liberating fun days I ever had, playing off this guy and having him play off me. So then, I went off later on and worked in a couple of more rock bands: Tinseled Sin and I went to New Jersey and worked with groups Pandemonium and Whisk. In Whisk, the guitar player, one of the main guys, was Kenny Siegel, who designed the Snarling Dog guitar effects pedals that you see everywhere nowadays. Really great guy. After a year or two of pooting around with them and having fun and joining the New Jersey musician’s union, which was a trip–AFLCIO and those guys in those days–I was frankly getting bored with the direction of the band. I’d go on back to visit my family over the holidays and I ran into my first ever bass player from my first band, Pepe Gonzalez. Pepe had since evolved and gotten heavy into jazz and he said, “Why don’t we do a fusion group? Like Weather Report, Mahivishnu-type thing?” So I said, “Okay!” So I went back to New Jersey and had to sever my ties with those guys. We’re all still friends. And came back to DC and built a band with Pepe. Again, I always start with a bass player if I’m going to start a project and I have any control over it whatsoever. I start with the bassist, get tight, and then I bring in other people. That’s what we did and we put together a really cool group called Magic Theater, which was–oh gosh, the biggest influence was probably 70s-era electric Miles [Davis]. You know, Garth [Webber] type stuff. And then, Pepe started bringing more straight up jazz into the picture and that’s anathema to me. I didn’t want to play in a jazz band. Didn’t then, don’t now.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Gently Disturbed by Avishai Cohen</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;video&quot;&gt;Video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4TothIYckG4?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-perfect-album-video-transcript&quot;&gt;A perfect album?! Video transcript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you catch the time signature of that piece? Yeah, I didn’t either the first time I heard it in 2010. Don’t worry though, I’ll share the answer with you at the end of this video. Anyway, back in 2010 my good friend and then-coworker Andy West played me this song in his car on the way back to work after lunch. He said, “I just heard of this jazz bass player from Israel. He’s unbelievable. Check out this song and see if you can figure out the time signature. I think you’ll dig it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andy was right. Not only was the time signature otherworldly, but I really did dig the piece. When the song ended, he said, “You gotta listen to the whole album. The guy’s name is Avishai Cohen and the album is called Gently Disturbed.” So I bought the album on iTunes later that day and gave it a listen. It immediately blew me away. The opening piece, titled Seattle, was one of the most beautiful and tender pieces of music I’d heard in a long time. It warmed my heart to hear such a beautiful melody complemented by these exotic-sounding harmonies. And since nearly all of my own music starts out as piano compositions, usually in strange time signatures and with unusual harmony, I felt right at home as a listener.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second track, Chutzpan, is the one Andy played me in his car. Its bombastic ostinatos, energetic drums, aggressive piano, and awesome improvisational interplays completely captivated me. It was my first time hearing Mark Guiliana on drums, which was an ear-opening experience for sure. He does things in this piece that are just so out there, from how-did-he-think-of-that rhythmic permutations to how-does-he-do-that, crazy-fast cross-sticking. I really can’t imagine the amount of effort and practice it took to get a song like this to sound so musical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third track, Lo Baiom Velo Balyla, offers an unusual mix of peaceful groove, airy space, and what sounds like a Phrygian dominant or harmonic major scale, all of which are representative of Avishai’s unique musicality. Given my total ignorance about the Middle East, I’ve researched and learned that he often arranges traditional Jewish songs into jazz pieces. This one is a traditional Hebrew song and the title means, “Not at Day, nor at Night,” and seems to be about a girl wondering who her future husband will be. It’s a gorgeous piece of music that’s very singable and catchy. It starts as a slow waltz and evolves into an upbeat, very danceable, groove. I love it. There’s another song on the record with many of the same musical qualities called Puncha Puncha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other tracks are like musical tongue twisters with very challenging rhythms and overlapping cyclical motifs. You’ll hear this in pieces like Pinzin Kinzin, Eleven Wives, The Ever Evolving Etude, Umray, and Structure in Emotion. Some of these songs have that same level of complexity and multilayered structure as Gentle Giant songs like Knots and On Reflection, which feature multilayered vocal parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won’t go song by song through the whole record, but I will say that I think the album is perfect. Yes, like, actually perfect. A work of perfection. I have listened to it many, many times, particularly while traveling, and it has always touched me in some way. It feels like an old friend now. Many of the songs feature masterful gentleness, pauses, and melody lines that make it stand out from nearly every other record out there. It is very dynamic, sounds fantastic, and makes you feel like you’re in the studio with them. It’s extremely intimate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s talk about the band. Gently Disturbed features Avishai Cohen on the bass, Shai Maestro on piano who was only 19 years old when this was recorded, and Mark Guiliana on drums. It was released in 2008 on Avishai’s record label, Razdaz Recordz. Avishai has played with several jazz heroes, including Chick Corea, Bobby McFerrin, Kurt Rosenwinkel, and a jazz hero of mine, Danilo Perez, whose Providencia album basically broke my brain when I first heard it. Also keep in mind that there are two Avishai Cohens, both of whom are jazz musicians born in Israel just a few years apart, but one plays the trumpet and the other plays upright and electric bass. This video is about the bassist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more I’ve listened to Avishai’s albums, the more I have discovered and enjoyed. I even bought two sheet music books from Avishai’s website just to study along with the music and and connect with it even further. A couple of songs make really interesting use of chromaticism and dissonance, like the title track, “Gently Disturbed.” It’s got some melodic lines that almost make the piano sound like a microtonal instrument. At other times, the middle eastern scales really add a sense of tension to my western ears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the overall beauty of the album is the very unique use of rhythm. Each band member layers polyrhythms in nearly every track. There are times when you can hear one of the musicians counting time by clicking their tongue on their teeth. It’s just wonderful, like those moments in some Frank Zappa vocals where you can hear his mouth opening and closing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shai Maestro’s use of chord substitutions in several solos makes me feel like every instrument, including the drums, briefly twists itself into alternate universes. None of these techniques are overused, though some friends have criticized Avishai’s use of repeating patterns and ostinatos, to which I say, “Go listen to Philip Glass or Steve Reich and then talk to me about repetition.” Others have said Mark’s drumming is too busy for the record, but they’re just wrong and don’t yet realize it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which leads me to mention what an absolute beast Mark Guiliana is on this record. There are times when he really supports the melodic and chordal work on the piano and bass, and then there are other times where they support him on some very adventurous drum solos. He is a truly unbelievable player that I wish would do more records with Avishai, though Avishai has somehow found some secret well full of the most talented young drummers in the world instead. I did have the pleasure of seeing Mark play with John Scofield and Brad Mehldau at the Blue Note in New York City, which was such a treat. Mark is one of the best live drummers I’ve ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can listen to the whole album on YouTube on Avishai’s RazDaz Recordz channel, but I recommend you just go out and buy it. It is really a work of art. And if you like this record, I recommend you check out these albums, too: Seven Seas, Aurora, and Lyla. Stunningly beautiful records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve unfortunately not had the chance to see Avishai perform live, but I’ve heard from friends that he’s fantastic in concert. Instead, I have watched several full concerts on YouTube that are quite enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know in the comments if you are a fan of Avishai or if he is new to you. I’d love to hear your thoughts on this music. Thanks for checking it out and thanks to Andy West for pointing me in Avishai’s direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and the time signature for Chutzpan is 17/8.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Nik Bärtsch's RONIN</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago when I started listening to Nik Baertsch, I thought I’d never have the chance to see him perform live. And then the unexpected happened: my generous friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://stairwaypress.com&quot;&gt;Ken Coffman&lt;/a&gt; sponsored not only &lt;a href=&quot;/concert/nik-baertsch&quot;&gt;a solo piano concert&lt;/a&gt;, but just a few months later he sponsored Nik and his entire zen funk band, RONIN, to perform in Apache Junction, AZ on March 21, 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would have filmed and recorded this show myself, but I was part of the opening act. Maybe there will be video of that some time in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I hope you enjoy this performance of &lt;em&gt;Modul 60&lt;/em&gt; from RONIN’s album &lt;em&gt;Awase&lt;/em&gt;. You can buy &lt;em&gt;Awase&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nikbaertsch.com/shop/&quot;&gt;Nik’s online shop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;video-transcription&quot;&gt;Video Transcription&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to Anthony “Ant” Bowles for the interview transcript.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ad&quot;&gt;Buy &lt;em&gt;Plausible Cause&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://damonshulman.bandcamp.com&quot;&gt;Damon’s Bandcamp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: When I interviewed Damon Shulman about his album &lt;em&gt;Plausible Cause&lt;/em&gt; in July 2017, almost two years ago, I had no idea that both he and I would face so many technical difficulties. But it’s really been on my heart the last couple of years that I never released the interview because Damon really is an artist that’s unique and worth your time and attention. Now if you’ve followed this site for any amount of time, you know that I like to try to release the highest possible quality of video and audio quality content, but that’s just not really an option on this one. Nevertheless, I really hope you enjoy the interview. It’s deep and philosophical, just like most of our other interviews, but it just has been difficult for me technically. Anyway, please enjoy this interview and check out Damon’s music at &lt;a href=&quot;https://damonshulman.bandcamp.com&quot;&gt;DamonShulman.bandcamp.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/VX95Ba74kS0?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Damon Shulman is a musician from the south of England and he has a new album out called &lt;em&gt;Plausible Cause&lt;/em&gt;, which I heard when it came out and I think it’s fantastic. It’s a very adventurous and fun album and Damon is here to talk to us about it.
Damon, thanks so much for joining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DS: Hello, thanks for inviting me, Anthony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Can you share with us a little about yourself and a little about the album?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DS: Yes of course. Well my name is Damon Shulman as you said. I am from the south of England, as you said and I am a musician, a full time musician and composer, producer, recording artist and sometimes live artist as well. I’ve been playing for a very long time. I’ve been playing in bands for forty years when I was about eleven and obviously I did a bit of schooling in between but obviously, I’ve been playing for that long and I started off as a bass player and was writing songs as well during what was called the Punk, New Wave era and was, funnily enough, influenced by people like my brother and my father, who showed me all kinds of music and it had a big effect on me. I could kind of tell, really from day one that I wanted to pursue this quite seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Music that is and so I have. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;There’s been periods when I haven’t done it but now I think it’s full-on till the end and I’ll keep going and keep going. I just love playing music, basically. And recording more than anything and writing. And basically that’s it.&lt;/span&gt; I come from, you probably know, I come from a musical family anyway. At least 50%. My mother can’t hit a note but my father was basically quite a serious musician at one point. His father as well - my grandfather. So there’s a tradition - Oh and my uncle as well so there’s quite a tradition in the Shulman family. So why not keep it going? My sons are also musicians, so we just love music. It’s a huge benefit, I think, to the world and I want to be part of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: That’s fantastic. Can you tell us a little about &lt;em&gt;Plausible Cause&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DS: &lt;em&gt;Plausible Cause&lt;/em&gt;, yes I have to count them off &lt;em&gt;Plausible Cause&lt;/em&gt; is my sixth solo album project. I had a bit of a gap. I’d done a project with a band about three or four years before. The last solo album was done in 2010. I was due to do something and I wanted to give it some kind of concept. Actually, I tell a lie there [laughs]. I forgot I actually did an album two years before called &lt;em&gt;Transition Process&lt;/em&gt;, which was actually supposed to lean to a new album, some new form of concept and that’s what it was called. I wanted something very definite to focus on and all I could think of is - I’m not a great person for anniversaries. You know, birthdays, decades - ‘Oh well done, you’ve survived’ that kind of thing. But I just broke through turning fifty and, well you know, let’s have a little review of my life. Maybe it’s not a bad thing to look at and what I thought was ‘What makes me me?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I went through a lot of back history and things that had happened to me. You know certain behaviours that I’d had throughout my life. So I thought this has got some substance. And about half way through this process, I realised I was embellishing, in my own mind - in my own internal dialogue embellishing things, which is odd. You might do it over drinks, that kind of thing.&lt;/span&gt; You know the fish, the fish, the ever growing fish that you’d caught but I started realising this is a very odd thing that I’m doing. Everything I was thinking was true (and that was where the plausibility came in) was true to a degree but not the entire truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I found myself saying, you know, I don’t think I’m being entirely honest here. This is how I became THIS from THIS. So it kind of broadened out. I thought, ‘Well if I think like this, surely there are other people who think like this’. So I started looking at all kind of things. You start looking at history, you know, how history is reported, how differing views of history, politics current affairs and you always see there are two sides to something. Well if there are two sides, there’s got to be - well there are two sides to the brain but there’s got to be multiple ways you think about oneself and this was why I was interested in this and this was before I got to the music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So this was all about literally, plausibility and what we think causes certain things. I didn’t have to be specific about it. I didn’t have to focus in on what I consider controversial which I kind of want to avoid. I’m not that, I don’t want to be specific about things. I’m not really here to upset people or anything like that. I just have a world-view of things. Kind of a well rounded view and what I consider… erm it’s just for the listener to decide on the impact, you know, of what occurred. I basically got all these ideas together - this is about, essentially people like myself, so I had to be musically quite accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I had planned to go a bit further off the edge but I felt there had to be some accessibility, sense of humour and just as if you were having a conversation with somebody, a long one. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;The album’s not all that long but you know those nights with a friend, you go through everything and maybe you’ve known people for a long time and someone points and says ‘No that’s not true.’ You know you could be talking to a friend and they say, you know ‘I was there.’ and ‘these things you’re saying are not true, what you’re saying.’&lt;/span&gt; And it doesn’t have to be confrontational. It’s just like, it’s funny. You know the fact that you can have all these ideas and in a cold kind of sober moment, suddenly realise ‘Oh No, I’ve made a fool of myself.’ So that’s kind of interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And musically, I wanted to convey that through various different means. I was most grateful for what you said about &lt;em&gt;Clarity Phase&lt;/em&gt;, the second song on the album. Interesting case in point. I wanted to create a very simple idea of a diatonic, simple climb up a scale and then on the ride a simple idea, simply played - tritones in major sevenths on the way down and then 2-5-1 at the end. And I was playing this cause everything you play, I mean I enjoy messing around and I can tell you how my process goes for writing, in a minute but with that one it just amused me, the idea - ‘Oh this seems like something.’ and it’s actually not but it kind of develops into something quite maudlin at one point in the middle, you know. That was all kind of funny to me, really. Also - I mean without wanting to be too dramatic, it actually develops into something I wanted to sound quite touching as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So there you go, all those kind of things going on. It was all about - ‘Here’s a thought.’ It seems fairly valid, whether it be musical or not, there then is an alternative to that and you’ve kind of got to be accepting of that or hopefully be successful as a writer. Accepting both approaches. Does that explain some of it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah, yeah. I think it’s fantastic. Actually, I have a big bookshelf right behind the camera and it’s full of books about what you’re talking about. We don’t ever make decisions rationally, at the time. We just make a decision and we rationalise looking back and we are often embellishing and believing things about ourselves in a positive light because we’re our own best friends. Whether we’re depressed or not. We tend to and have to, to survive we have to see the best things about ourselves. So it’s been a very interesting journey for my myself, the last few years of reading and researching. So a lot of that album’s material does connect with me in that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DS: That’s great. I absolutely agree with you as well. Funnily enough, when I’m writing, recording, just thinking about anything in particular - you know what, I kind of had the opposite kind of approach. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I don’t read at all. I try and avoid those structures of influence because I want to be purely me.&lt;/span&gt; Without wanting to sound pompous, to create the art, because the art is, for me I suppose, although I don’t have a direct definition on me but the art for me is creating something from the imagination that is very much real, is insight - not insight but in our sight	and we can develop it through the imagination and hopefully through some skills as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Like I say with my writing process, though you haven’t asked me the question but I’ll volunteer this - how I go about writing generally comes from practise. Believe it or not, I love to practise. I’m a guitarist first of all; that’s my first instrument. As I said I started on the bass and that was one of several things - I started on the violin when I was four. It was literally thrust into my hands as if to say ‘Well you’ve got to play an instrument.’ and I was alright because I learned some music from that. I had some tuition and I learnt some music, some dots and also the idea of how to make sounds that were interesting for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;You know and then I learned trumpet but it was all uncomfortable for me all that stuff. Never learn the trumpet if you’re looking for an easy life, you know. It’s physically demanding and it’s just incredibly hard to play but that’s my father for me. He’ll do that kind of thing - ‘Try that son it’s what I play.’ ‘OK dad.’ but then it’s ‘No I don’t like this.’ ‘No, carry on.’ ‘No I really don’t…’ And eventually it was a case of I do want to play but no. And eventually a guitar was put in my hands and I did try a few things but funnily enough it was my uncle Ray [Shulman of &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/gentle-giant&quot;&gt;Gentle Giant&lt;/a&gt;] who said ‘Try him on the bass.’ He was a bass player and I did and ended up being recruited into my brother’s Punk band, who were a bunch of sixteen and seventeen year old geezers from Portsmouth and wow, I had a great time at eleven and twelve. But what was I saying?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Practise, That’s where most of my music ideas come from.&lt;/span&gt; It’s like delving into, I’m interested in the whole process of music. I think it’s a fascinating thing. I think it’s fascinating when humans have created this amazing complex language that has so many variations. From a western point of view, twelve notes and you think this is unbelievable and you just think, wow so many combinations and the methods you can go around things and you can make it be the most complex thing in the world or the simplest thing in the world and vice-versa and through juxtaposition you can communicate with people, sometimes without a single word. That to me is fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I dive straight into it and use this in my practising and it becomes composition and that’s how it happens and how &lt;em&gt;Plausible Cause&lt;/em&gt; was created - an awful lot of ideas from memories and influences. I’m deeply, sometimes burdened but deeply influenced by certain musicians and certain sounds as well. It’s sometimes the most obvious, if you like, popular music that I’m interested in. Also at the other end of the scale, the weirdest if you like. I think, at least I’ve been told that it really does come to fruition and you can hear those influences. You wouldn’t necessarily know exactly who the influences were. This is not contrived in any way, it just happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Over a period of years I just used to write songs, like we all do - write a song but that wasn’t enough for me. I really wanted to be interested. I kind of like the autodidactic process - teaching yourself and trying to educate yourself and pushing always pushing. In which case you have to be curious, I’m very curious - investigative. Looking at those intriguing little passages that are kind of dark and unknown to you. Go and research, go and have a look at them and I think that’s how you move on. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Sometimes you reach a dead end, other times these tributaries really have gold at the bottom of them.&lt;/span&gt; So that’s what I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plausible Cause&lt;/em&gt; was like that. There are different styles in there and the way I structured the pieces not songs. Does that sound snobby? But you know from one to seven you’ll find if you listen, the styles kind of, or this was my intent anyway, but the intent was to start with a kind of dissonance. The lyric in the first piece is straightforward and simple. It’s about confusion - a general observation of what people I talk to are saying - ‘What’s it all about?’ They don’t know anything yet they they carry on and tell you what they think they know - certain people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So there’s a certain level of confusion that it always seems to be to leave me feeling perplexed. I thought, ‘Well I definitely don’t know anything having spoken to you. I know even less.’ So I have those sort of conversations. So I have these opening salvos of flat five arpeggios going up and down with a minor seven arpeggio and it sounded interesting to me while I was practising and I wanted to build something up with what was a fairly facile lyrical idea. You know it’s getting a bit dark really, saying ‘I don’t know what it’s all about.’ - just saying that. So I thought there was some kind of interesting contrast there and bit by bit that unraveled. It’s really quite jerky, quite quirky, the first piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;There’s more fluency there and by the time you get to the end, it’s almost Rock and Roll. I mean track number four could sound a bit balladeery. Kind of a love song but it’s a bit of an acerbic lyric there. A bit self self pitying actually in certain respects. That is based on my love of old jazz standards. It’s not a tribute but it is a nod to it and how, in their syruppy sentimental way, they really do have some impact and that’s what I wanted. There’s really quite a serious lyric on that. I said self pitying but I really meant self deprecating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s not entirely about me, there’s just two or three lines in there but you get autobiographical about these things. And that was what you really could consider a very straightforward song. This is track four called An Honest Man. Just thinking about that (because I skipped over two) &lt;em&gt;Honest Man&lt;/em&gt; was in fact being earnest - being honest about something and musically, just straightforward. Just play this three, sixes dada da da dada da kind of thing, which sounded a bit, half Doowoppy - half Jazzy. But then it has that middle guitar and piano solo. I’m a real hack piano player by the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;When I solo on the piano I have to use me left hand. And you build up to this, rationalising things. There’s a sudden rationalisation of the end by the time you get to track four to record. Just explaining, I’m doing them out of order. Which is probably how they came to me. Obviously I don’t write them and at the same time decide say this is track 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: You may be rationalising right now, I don’t know. [Laughter]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DS: But going back to the pieces, it almost became an exercise, initially and then it became a process of seeing both sides of an argument and the point was and the obvious cliche was a moment of clarity. The song doesn’t mention me having a moment of clarity. It’s all about making an initial decision and then doubting that decision. I might be right or I might be wrong. I’m not really sure about this and that’s what sends you into awe for the people of power, who are so assertive and affirmative with their decisions and of course, they’re not really that assertive. They’ve got to show that. Yeah, so that’s where it was going to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Some people become president like that. [Laughter]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DS: Absolutely! And what can you do about it? You can go march on the street if you want but all I can do is laugh. Because, what can you do? Write music I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: One thing I wanted to bring up - It takes a special kind of insanity to play every instrument on an album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DS: Well, it’s because I have no shame really. I don’t mind embarrassing myself. I’ll give anything a go. I’ve been doing it for some time, that kind of thing. If I’m really honest, first and foremost, I am a guitarist and that is what I work on but I have in my time, played many different instruments. I’ve encouraged other musicians to do this, because if you’ve got a certain propensity for musical instruments, I believe you can give most things a go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;To be honest the drumming on this was written using drum samples. My setup, at the back of my house, you can’t get a reasonable sound there. That was one hell of an research job because I have strong ideas of how I wanted the rhythm to work. I don’t write it down on a stave or anything and that was difficult to sort out. Eventually, it all came together how I wanted it. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;And also I work on a budget of between seven and ten dollars [laughs] If I’m spending nine dollars fifty, I’m really stretching it.&lt;/span&gt; So you know I can’t go to a studio and play it. I’m not a great drummer but I’ll play it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: So was that done on a keyboard, you program a MIDI grid? The drums sound really good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DS: It’s Billy Martin playing - Billy Martin samples. All legal - all bought. My budget isn’t that bad really. It was all taken from his kit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: I was really impressed with the drums and how they fit in and drive some of the songs along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DS: I like songs like that - driving and also that kind of polyrhythmic kind of thing, working against the other side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AG: Very, very interesting drum parts but I have to say the guitar parts are so adventurous. I’m a guitarist too. Like that whole last part of &lt;em&gt;Clarity Phase&lt;/em&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Clarity Phase&lt;/em&gt; excerpt]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: It’s so twisty, turny, adventurous. This is the most astounding guitar work I’ve heard in years. It’s just so different and you’re not trying to fit, you’re not trying to do anything idiomatic to the guitar. You’re playing like a written, interesting part on the guitar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DS: I really appreciate you saying that and thank you very much. They were written parts, not improvised but the guitarists I love to listen to are improvising but I didn’t want to do that on this album. I’ve done that on recorded pieces but I don’t think it would have worked for where I wanted the guitar solos to be. I wanted the guitar to scream a particular message, whatever that may be, whatever the listener wants it to be. Therefore the use of certain scales against certain chords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Certainly it was necessary to write the parts although if you wanted to hear my track recordings, it wasn’t two takes. The high risk of going through a number of bars, certain shapes and certain runs is enormous. You could be like ‘I got it, I got it, I got it. I haven’t got it.’ So it got to that twenty five, thirty take thing. But so what, I just had to do it. I’m really glad you noticed that. I thought long and hard about that. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;And that came from practise drills but it’s that intrigue and it depends how far you want to push it - how far you want to push that dissonance. How close you want dissonance and consonance work together. How close can you go?&lt;/span&gt; At what point does someone listening say that is dissonance and I’m saying it’s not? That’s what I’m doing and hopefully, it works. It worked for you and that’s good enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: It really works and it’s really interesting and it goes way beyond what other guitarists are doing. I can hear one who’s had a night of four hours just trying to play one part. I can hear the frustration coming through and you’re stretching yourself on certain parts of the album and I don’t say that in a pejorative way. It’s really cool to hear someone stretching themself to their own limit and it still works musically. But for a musician who knows about recording, who knows about performance, I can hear that you are really striving and I think it’s awesome that you put it out the way that you did. It’s a little bit messy at times and it’s just in a little universe that stands on its own and is pretty different from what’s out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DS: I really appreciate those observations because they’re correct and I feel, fortunately or unfortunately for me - probably unfortunately and that’s why I’m on a tight budget. There gets to a point when the striving bit is absolutely right. I got to my fifties but I don’t feel you can rest on your… I’m not a satisfied guitarist. I’m never happy with what I do. I don’t think I’m good enough, particularly when I watch someone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wc7Qvp8Zs6U?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;My first influences on guitar - my dad introduced me to Robby Robertson - &lt;em&gt;Give Me Some Time&lt;/em&gt; - harmonically played and with so much tenderness with the guitar but then when I discovered Jazz quite early, I was eighteen, nineteen and the first time with Joe Pass. A beautiful guitarist, beautiful harmonies. Fluid, the chord changes - everything about him was fascinating for me. And then Wes Montgomery and then later on Pat Martino - his ideas. Using parental forms and all that kind of stuff. Talk about pushing you - making your mind work, thinking ‘What’s he talking about ?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially when you don’t know, it’s like WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT? And then after the elucidation - Ah! The revelation. You realise what these people are talking about, all of a sudden and that’s why these people play like that. They don’t use it every five seconds. They’re usually playing with what most people understand. Having that in there somewhere is really useful for you and of course - John Scofield, I adore. Fabulous guitarist. He’s one of those guitarists who, when he plays a note, you know instantly that’s John Scofield. So those are the types of guitarists I like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZPUWhmQ1Hvk?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: What about Allan Holdsworth?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DS: I know a lot of people like Allan Holdsworth and I appreciate what he does but it almost gets scientific. I like the approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: He’s exploring other boundaries to those other guys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DS: He’s very much doing his own thing. I mean, poor fella’s gone now. You’ve got to appreciate people like that because they are very much doing their own thing and creating their own sound. I think the problem for me is emulation. I mean when people try to be Allan Holdsworth. I guess it kind of clouds my judgement. Yeah, obviously he’s a very good guitarist but not a big influence on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: I only brought him up because of the exotic scales you are using in some of the solos on the album. I was curious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DS: I’ll take that as a complement. If I’m being compared to Allan Holdsworth, it’s a massive complement. Blimey!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Your note choices are really different. So I love it; I thought it was great. So for people who don’t know about you and where to get your music and find out about you, where do they go to support you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DS: I should have written this down somewhere. I’ll tell you what, I used to operate a small web site but it’s a complete waste of time business wise. It’s a lot of money to do these things so I literally just run off BandCamp. I have my BandCamp site, which is https://damonshulman.bandcamp.com/ and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/damonshulman/&quot;&gt;a Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DamonShulman&quot;&gt;a Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;. That’s all I’ve got. No wonder I’m so famous. I can’t stop people knocking on my door all the time. [Laughter]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah the video I published recently with an artist called &lt;a href=&quot;/share/shawn-persinger/halloween-baptizm&quot;&gt;Shawn Persinger&lt;/a&gt;. He wrote a book called &lt;em&gt;Nobody Knows I’m Famous&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DS: That’s right. Maybe we should get together and he could write a book about me. No one will read it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;transcription&quot;&gt;Transcription&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several years ago, I was building a Lotus Super 7 replica using a wrecked Mazda Miata donor car and a body kit. After my wife and I had our second child, I had to sell the car due to lack of time. That’s when I said to my wife, “By the time I’m 40, I want to have a home studio and a Lotus Super 7.” Her response was, “You can choose one.” It was a tough choice, but I eventually went with the studio. And in early 2018 at the age of 36, I bit the bullet, got a home equity loan, and got started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my studio and this is the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building a home studio is easily one of the best and most fulfilling things I’ve ever done. Sometimes I sit in here and gaze with childlike wonder over how much I love this private 280-square-foot creative oasis. Part of me knows it’s because of all the literal blood, sweat, tears, and money my friends and I put into it. Part of me knows it’s because I’ve built a place where I can find peace. Part of me knows it’s the ikea effect on a pretty large scale. But the most interesting aspect is what it represents: freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many musicians, I’ve dreamt for years about moving my gear out of a cramped bedroom and into a proper, dedicated creative space. It all started as a teenager when my dad and I built a small studio in my old bedroom using an Alesis ADAT XT, a PowerPC Mac tower with an A/V card, a cheap 8-track Mackie mixer, a CD burner, and a CD stomper. We would track directly to the ADAT, run each output through the Mackie, and print to the stereo inputs on the Mac’s AV card. From there we put the audio files into a CD-burning app called Toast and we were able to get our music into people’s ears quickly and easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We mixed and recorded several albums there, including his musical interpretations of the Mesopotamian story The Epic of Gilgamesh and the Navajo story Big Star Way. I also recorded  my first two “albums” Hansel Vs. Gretel and Mytopia there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a teenager, I saved every dollar I could to buy music gear, including a Johnson Millennium amplifier, several instruments, strings, ADAT SVHS tapes, blank CDs, and CD label stickers. It was an incredible, hands-on learning experience for several years. Then in 2002 I got an internship with Steve Vai and learned how things are done in the big leagues. My dad and I went all-in on Pro Tools after that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I moved out and got married, I still kept a bedroom studio, complete with Tupperware containers full of cables, hard drives, CD spools, and instruments. When my wife and I had kids, I got rid of my amplifiers and got a digital drum kit, which allowed me to record at any hour without waking a sleeping baby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, when I started MWM 5 years ago in 2014, the recording studio also became a video production studio and required a ton more gear, including lights, cameras, tripods, and a backdrop. The site grew and grew, as did my collection of gear, until I just couldn’t fit in a 110 square foot room anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late 2017, after a couple years of discussion, we bit the bullet and decided to build something new in the backyard. We set a budget of about $25K, got a home equity loan, and I worked with my neighbor who runs a construction company. He and I got a design together and spent several months refining and getting through the permit approval process until we finally broke ground in May 2018. We went through every idea from an upgraded Tuff Shed to prefab kits to structural insulated panels to storage containers to tiny houses. I spent hours and hours and hours researching this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live in Arizona where it gets very hot in the summers and fairly chilly in the winters. I also live next to a main road with lots of traffic, so insulation was a major concern. We decided on 2x6 16” on center construction for the walls with R-19 fiberglass batts. We did 2x12” 16” on center for the roof with R-38 fiberglass. I wanted a southwestern-style building with a single sloped roof so I could have a square wall to film against in the back of the building. I wanted to walk into the building and have a rising ceiling to give the illusion of more height and it worked out great. This also had drainage advantages to handle Arizona’s flash-flood rains that could drop several inches of rain in just a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of drainage, we also had to design new drainage flows for the areas surrounding the building. We put in a French drainage system and graded the dirt so water would flow into the French drains. We also added gutters on my house to help with the drainage. The last thing I needed was any chance of flooding or risk to the foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My neighbor and I designed the inside with two zones in mind. The front half would be the entry zone with computing, socializing, and slumber functions. I work from home a lot, we like to have company over, and we frequently have touring musicians looking for a place to stay for a night. The back half of the studio would be the video production zone where I could film and keep gear set up without constantly tearing down and reassembling when I wanted to film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another major consideration was electricity. In the old bedroom studio, I tripped our circuit breaker in the summer pretty regularly because of all the electricity I needed to film at night with lights, computers, and a dedicated air conditioner. That room shared a circuit with our kitchen appliances, so if I drew too much power and my wife used the microwave, it was bad for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a lot of grand ideas in mind when designing this thing. I wanted tons of shelving, everything on wheels, a ramp system outside the house to make it easy to transport rolling gear, and more, but a lot of this was pure fantasy for someone who’d never built something of this scale before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had an in-ground hot tub in the backyard with its own 160-amp circuit and subpanel. We used all that amperage for a dedicated HVAC mini split system and two 15-amp circuits inside the studio. I knew I would primarily use LED lighting and camera gear, so the 30 amps would be overkill, but better safe than sorry. I made sure there were plenty of outlets in the design, so we put in floor outlets, ceiling outlets, and lots of four-gang outlets on the walls. Altogether, I believe there are 52 outlets in the building, as opposed to the 6 outlets I had in the bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We faced several weeks of delays in the permit approval process. We ripped out the hot tub, my neighbor’s company poured a slab, and we framed it very quickly. I spent weeks putting up OSB and plywood sheathing waking up early before the scalding Arizona summer heat would begin. I usually started at 6, would have some meetings from 730 until 8, then I would work more until 9. If I could work through lunch, I would. Then I would work from 5pm until dinner and sometimes after dinner until about 9pm or sometimes later, like until midnight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hours were grueling, but I was incentivized to finish as soon as possible. The quicker I finished, the quicker I could start working out there. I barely published any MWM videos during that time. Plus it was so hot that I just wanted to be done with the project. I almost passed out several times nailing down plywood sheathing on the roof in direct sun that was easily 120 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My kids helped out a lot too and learned on the job. They used a skillsaw, measured wood, and helped out with the fire blocking pieces protecting the roof from risk of fire. They also helped a lot with installing electric wiring and outlets. It was fantastic even though we were all so so hot out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t articulate how difficult and painful the framing process was for me. I hit my thumb so many times that it bled internally under my fingernail. I had dried blood in my thumbnail for at least 4 months. I dropped hundreds of nails when they would bounce out of the OSB sheathing. It was so infuriating that I had emotional breakdowns at least once a week that ended with me smashing 2x12” scraps into pieces with a hammer. I’ve never been so angry at my mistakes as I was in this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the framing was complete, I hired a contractor to install a membrane roof and “dry in” the building. This was a major milestone because I could then leave tools in the building without worrying about weather. Many beers were had to celebrate and enjoy this milestone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another friend helped me with all the electric work and the ceiling lights. I hired a contractor to install the high voltage wiring and subpanel inside the building. He also helped me get my wiring up to code. I learned how to wire outlets and switches on YouTube and used the pigtail method on every outlet, even when it was unnecessary. I loved doing pigtails, cutting and stripping wire, capping everything, and preparing the building for live power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the electric was done, I bought some windows off a friend who was remodeling his home. Then I had another couple of friends help me install them and the doors. They also helped with the insulation installation. This was a very grueling process because our framing wasn’t exact and required a lot of unnecessary cutting of the fiberglass batting. We spent several days working on that. It was painful. Really painful and we worked past midnight for several days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part of the insulation installation was that I could bring my portable air conditioner into the building. Between the windows and the insulated walls, I could keep the room in the 80s as opposed to the 90s or 100s in the weeks prior. This was amazing, although the air conditioner kept filling up with water and I had to drain it almost every hour during the rain season. It was a pain and I eventually just let the water drain onto the floor so I wouldn’t have to drain it manually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step was drywall, which was a bit of a fiasco because I wanted the ⅝” longest sheets possible for the ceiling. I ordered 12-foot sheets from Home Depot and my friend and I installed them with a lift. These sheets are REALLY REALLY heavy. This was easily the most frustrating part of the construction because we kept measuring and cutting incorrectly. We had to buy replacement sheets and it was a huge mess. I still can’t get all the gypsum dust off the floor. I will never do drywall installation on a ceiling again, especially with 12-foot sheets that weigh more than 100 pounds each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make it easier, I bought a tool called a rotozip and it was the greatest tool I’d ever used. The best $80 spent on the whole project, without a doubt. If you are doing anything with drywall, get a rotozip. You will not regret it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned everything about drywall installation on YouTube. I also learned that drywall installation isn’t easy, especially the mud, tape, and texture process. I installed all the drywall on the walls by myself and did not want to deal with the mud and tape. So I hired a local crew and they did a fantastic job. Absolutely fantastic. They made all my flaws disappear. It was stunning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the texture was finished, I started painting the inside and the room came to life. I also hired a crew to put exterior insulation and smooth finish stucco on. This process took a couple of weeks because it’s many coats of concrete and the process requires curing. It was also raining a lot during this time, so it took much longer than I expected for this to get finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all this I was able to hire a guy to install the HVAC system. He did a great job, but the first unit he installed was defective. He also went on a 3-week vacation during all this and I had work travel so it was a real headache coordinating with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of headaches and coordination, dealing with the permit approval process was not easy either. Wow, did I learn a lot through that. Every major step required an inspection and there are only two inspectors for my area. To put this into context, my county has been the fastest growing county in the United States for many years. We have more new construction and building permits than anywhere else in America. And my city of several hundred thousand people only has two inspectors. Those guys visited more than a dozen sites per day and I had to schedule days or weeks in advance. This is a real problem when you’re trying to get something done quickly! Especially when one of them goes on vacation for a couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, it took about four months for the building to be totally usable. By August 2018, I had a “studio opening” party and hired the band Evil Genius to come play. It was an awesome concert and there’s footage of that show on our channel. In March 2019 we finished the installation of the exterior patio, window and door trim, and baseboards. The studio is finally complete (except I have to paint the trim and baseboards). The only thing that remains is metal cap flashing on the parapet wall, and if you know what that means, then you’ll know it’s relatively trivial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost all the tools I used for this project were borrowed from friends and family. Even though I probably built 50-60% of this building, I could not have done it without the guidance, contributions, and talents of many friends. Seriously, I owe it to all of them because I am not a particularly handy person. I have a master’s degree in technology, so most of my expertise is in computer stuff. I learned a ton from them and from YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project helped me to learn about things like crickets and scuppers, UFER grounds, termite treatments and orange tags, pigtails, j-bolts, z-hangers, strong ties, fireblocking, 20 ounce hammers, rotozips, mud rings, and more. I went to Home Depot and Lowe’s 3-10 times per week. I taught my kids how to use power tools. I learned how to best hammer a nail through OSB on a 2x6 frame. I learned how to fail inspections and install windows. I know where every screw and nail and beam are in this building. There is literally still dried blood on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve never felt so free and empowered in my life. This building has taught me that I can do anything I set my mind to. And now I have my own little slice of heaven. It’s not perfect and there are definitely some things I would do differently if I could do it again, but man what an experience. In a day and age where my hands are primarily on computer keyboards, glass touch screens, or guitar strings, to get my hands dirty and bloody was just awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for numbers, here are the basics: the building cost me $25,000, so about $80-100 per square foot, but the real estate market is selling at $150 per square foot and higher in my area. It increased the value of my home significantly. Other people in my neighborhood spent $50K doing similar projects in their yard. The outdoor flagstone patio work was another $10,000, but that can be done much cheaper with concrete or stone pavers. We could have done a lot of things cheaper too, but I didn’t want to compromise much on quality. This is a once-in-a-lifetime type project for me, so we wanted to do it right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re thinking of doing something similar, I want to encourage you to bite the bullet. It’s good for you and it’s good for the world. We need more people who have hands-on experience instead of armchair expertise. More people creating their own destinies instead of waiting for life to happen to them. More people producing than consuming. More doers and fewer intellectual yet idiots. Feel free to reach out with more questions and please share your own studio projects if you’ve made one yourself. Even though I thought this project would be boring for people, there sure has been a lot of enthusiasm so thank you for all your support! You inspired me to finish and share! So thanks for listening to all this. I plan on sharing more about the studio in the future. If you have suggestions of what you’d like to know, let me know in the comments. If you would have chosen the Lotus Super 7 instead of the studio, I’d also like to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Learn San Lorenzo by Pat Metheny and Lyle Mays</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-this-song&quot;&gt;Why This Song?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://patmetheny.com&quot;&gt;Pat Metheny&lt;/a&gt; is an incredible composer and guitarist. I absolutely love a lot of his work (some I definitely don’t!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was asked if I would perform this song with my friend Jonathan Sindelman for his opening act when MWM brought &lt;a href=&quot;/concert/nik-baertsch&quot;&gt;Nik Bärtsch&lt;/a&gt; to Arizona in March 2019. Learning a Pat song sounded fun and interesting. Little did I know what I was getting myself into!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ad&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/san-lorenzo/83913842?i=83913844&quot;&gt;Purchase Pat Metheny’s San Lorenzo on Apple Music &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-apple&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not an easy song to learn. First of all, you need a 12-string electric guitar. Second, you need to play in a non-standard tuning (shouldn’t be a surprise to Pat fans). Third, the non-standard tuning requires a set of custom strings that are all plain steel, except for one. Crazy! Here are the details on the tuning, courtesy of YouTube commenter David Kean:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low to high!&lt;br /&gt;
Eb3 .021w/Bb3 .013   5th&lt;br /&gt;
F3 .018 /C4 .012   5th&lt;br /&gt;
Ab3 .015 /Eb4 .010   5th&lt;br /&gt;
Bb3 .013 /F4 .009   5th&lt;br /&gt;
C4 .012  /G4 .008    5th&lt;br /&gt;
F4 .009/F4 .009   Unison&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no good video of this song on YouTube, so I had to figure it all out by ear. The sheet music wasn’t of much help, either, because the tuning is non-standard, so learning how to read the sheet music in this tuning was like learning a new instrument. While I know I am not playing what Pat plays, this is a good “fake” playthrough that’ll accompany the track well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;video&quot;&gt;Video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the instructional video for this piece.&lt;/p&gt;
