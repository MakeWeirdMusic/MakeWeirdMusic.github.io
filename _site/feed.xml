&lt;h2 id=&quot;interview-transcript&quot;&gt;Interview transcript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Hi this is Anthony from MakeWeirdMusic.com and I am here with &lt;a href=&quot;http://teddyjam.com&quot;&gt;Teddy Kumpel &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, guitarist for &lt;a href=&quot;http://joejackson.com/&quot;&gt;Joe Jackson &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and man of many musical adventures.
Teddy, can you tell us about yourself, and your formation as a musician?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: My formation, yes… Okay, here it goes. I was born on Long Island, New York. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;My father was a mathematician and my mom was a church organist&lt;/span&gt;. My father played &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_(Manhattan)&quot;&gt;Broadway &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show_tune&quot;&gt;show tunes &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;When I was a kid, we sang and played a lot. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;My mom played tons of classical music and also &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragtime&quot;&gt;rags &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. She loves &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Joplin&quot;&gt;Scott Joplin &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and super early jazz stuff, so I was definitely informed by that.&lt;/span&gt; I think by the time I got to be maybe in third grade, I was already playing guitar. We should start with guitar, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I was already playing guitar by maybe 3? I was probably playing &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukulele&quot;&gt;ukulele &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and both my parents were in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbershop_quartet&quot;&gt;barbershop quartets &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Wow! That’s pretty cool!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Yeah, so my sister and I would learn harmonies to the barbershop quartets and sing with my parents in the car when driving somewhere. We’d learn how to sing background harmonies at a very young age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Ukulele, barbershop quartet - that’s the early years. Let’s see… Then we move up to the 3rd grade. So, school band, playing saxophone… I didn’t grow up wealthy or anything, so my summer camp was going to summer school at the local elementary school. This was in the 70s…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And my music teacher, Claire Kahn, was super cool, and since I didn’t really know if I liked the saxophone as I was into the ukulele more,
I said, “Hey, I want to try the tuba.” She was like, “Yeah, sure, try the tuba! Take that home!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;She let me take home every band instrument one summer and I tried the viola, cello, tuba, trombone… everything you can think of.&lt;/span&gt; French horn, trumpet–I just took them home and messed around with them and &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I think that kind of informed my guitar playing, because just the willingness to go in many different places and try things, and make different sounds other than guitar sounds was part of my upbringing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And then I played in concert bands from 3rd grade until I was a senior, and I played all different instruments. I played baritone horn, tuba, trombone, saxophone… all that stuff, and then also played guitar in the jazz band.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I had an excellent guitar teacher when I was a kid. This guy–&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stonybrookmusic.com/richard_rabatin.html&quot;&gt;Richard Rabatin &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; who was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://berklee.edu&quot;&gt;Berklee &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; composition major–taught me. I guess he recognized when I was like 14 when I started with him that I had a pretty good ear. So he started me on atonal sight-singing right away, which he apologizes for now. Hi Rich! [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;That really opened up my ears I think at a young age, and he showed me a lot of stuff that I don’t think any other teacher would have gone there with such a young kid.&lt;/span&gt; Yeah. So… There you go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Did you play piano at all with your mother’s influence or anything?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: My mom was so good at piano that when I watched her play, I was like, “Um, I’ll never be able to do that. I’m sticking with guitar.” [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: You obviously were passionate enough about guitar to go to Berkelee College of Music, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: I didn’t go to Berkelee College of Music. I got a scholarship to go there and I decided that I’d rather go to University of Miami, so I went there and that was really great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;In my freshman year there, my roommate was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.andytimmons.com/&quot;&gt;Andy Timmons &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I had a bunch of great guitar players around me: &lt;a href=&quot;http://brianmonroney.com&quot;&gt;Brian Monroney &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.du.edu/ahss/lamont/faculty-staff/faculty/abbott-mike.html&quot;&gt;Mike Abbott &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.timmitchellmusic.com&quot;&gt;Tim Mitchell &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://shakira.com&quot;&gt;Shakira’s &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; musical director. We were all in it together and started teaching each other stuff as we went along, and it was really great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: What did you focus on as part of your guitar instruction?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: I think the first couple of years in Miami were sort of an eye opener for me, because it showed me how much Richard, my teacher in high school, showed me. I placed out of all the theory classes and I didn’t have to take any of them, but also I realized that I didn’t know a lot of things on the guitar that a lot of other people knew, so it was all about learning all your chord voicings, learning tunes, jazz tunes, and transcribing. It was the Studio Music and Jazz Program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Where did you go from there, once you graduated? What were some of your early opportunities as a musician?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Well, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;while I was in college, I was playing 6 nights a week playing &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_40&quot;&gt;Top 40 music &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, to get myself through. So, 6 nights a week, 6 sets a night.&lt;/span&gt; That was Miami in the 80s. South Florida in the 80s. That’s the thing–you could just play and play and play. You’d join bands and make a couple dollars. And the main thing about that was that you’d be learning tunes constantly, because you had to know whatever was on the radio. And it would get your stamina up. You’d have to play so long every night that if you can’t stand on the stage for that long, if you got tired or didn’t give it your 100%… [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: How long did you do that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: That was probably a good 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Brutal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: You must have burned through strings. It’s humid in Miami, playing 6 nights a week too…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Yeah, true, true, true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: 6 sets?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: 6 sets a night…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Oh my goodness…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Yeah…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Dance Clubs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: It started like 8 o’clock at night and ended like 2 or 3 in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Wow, and you never traveled? You just stayed in Miami doing these clubs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: I was sort of like up and down the coast of Florida. I think the farthest north we went was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Palm_Beach,_Florida&quot;&gt;West Palm Beach &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but we would also go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_Largo,_Florida&quot;&gt;Key Largo &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for a month. If you weren’t in school at the time you could go do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: How long were you in Florida?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/H_gNrf6-5uA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: About 5 years. I took a gig with this band &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_Silk&quot;&gt;Rare Silk &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. They were like the weird &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Manhattan_Transfer&quot;&gt;Manhattan Transfer &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. They got a Grammy nomination, and they were really a creative band. I toured with them with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ric_Fierabracci&quot;&gt;Ric Fierabracci&lt;/a&gt; on bass and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.umdrums.com/2015/08/16/olbin-burgos/&quot;&gt;Olbin Burgos &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who played drums for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesoundmachine.net&quot;&gt;Miami Sound Machine &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for a long time
and this amazing producer from Miami, &lt;a href=&quot;http://lestermendez.flavors.me/&quot;&gt;Lester Mendez &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_Mendez) playing keyboard. We were their band, and we toured for about a year, then we all quit. [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Something happened?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: I think we wanted more money and they wouldn’t give us more money, something like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: And when was this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: It was about 1986.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: What’s been going on, you know after that, since then?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: After that, I moved to New York, and did what every young starving musician does in New York in the 80s. At least there were only a few things that you could do to make money and one of the main ones was doing club dates or weddings. So &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I think between 1988 and 1998, I did about probably 750 weddings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Oh my goodness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: You were probably really good at wedding music by then after the Miami dance scene, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Well, Miami pop music/dance scene was sort of like what’s on the radio, and wedding was in NY are a very specific thing. You’ve got to know your &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Sinatra&quot;&gt;Frank Sinatra &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you’ve got to know a couple of standards, some &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bossa_nova&quot;&gt;Bossa Novas &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you have &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antônio_Carlos_Jobim&quot;&gt;Jobim &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you’ve got to know…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Maybe there’s a set of dance music, maybe there’s a set of oldies dance music like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sly_and_the_Family_Stone&quot;&gt;Sly and the Family Stone &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. So it’s very diverse and &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;you meet a lot of really great players when you do weddings in New York because everybody does them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;If you’re not a producer, or if you’re a musician and you’re only a side man and that’s your job, then you’re gonna probably going to end up in a wedding gig at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;A: Yeah, it’s funny &lt;a href=&quot;/interview/andy-west&quot;&gt;Andy West&lt;/a&gt; was in a band called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.andywest.com/music/recordings/fwap2.html&quot;&gt;Fwap &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with a guitarist named &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.joaquinmusic.com/&quot;&gt;Joaquin Levano &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in New York, and my dad recently moved back to NY. He’s been playing and he met Joaquin through the keyboard player that my dad has known for a long time, and Joaquin and Scott [keyboardist] were playing weddings in New York! So that’s just funny talking to my dad. “You know, you’ve got this guitarist named Joaquin Levano” Like, what? He played with Andy West! And my dad played and I with Andy West shortly in Arizona, so…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;T: Oh yeah? Cool. Andy’s super cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yeah. Everyone plays weddings in New York!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So what about your own compositions like [Loopestra]  (http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/teddykumpel)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/PDnftXsCwsQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Yeah, it’s my own music. Composition-wise, started composing, and I would say when I was in high school I was writing instrumental rock tunes. Then in Miami, I started writing a lot more, branching out, writing lyrics, and putting together little productions of things on a 4-track recorder, trying to figure out how to do that. Then I had a band in the early 90s called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/nomesane&quot;&gt;Nome Sane? &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;http://tonyscherr.com/&quot;&gt;Tony Scherr &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who’s the bass player for &lt;a href=&quot;http://billfrisell.com&quot;&gt;Bill Frisell &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.andymiddleton.com/&quot;&gt;Andy Middleton &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who’s an amazing sax player, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.briandunnedrums.com/&quot;&gt;Brian Dunne &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; who’s the drummer for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hallandoates.com/&quot;&gt;Hall and Oates &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Oh wow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: We had a funk band. That was pretty fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Nome Sane?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Nome Sane? &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/nome-sane/id46625193&quot;&gt;You can find that on iTunes &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Oh cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: It has a question mark at the end. Nome Sane, question mark. We did some touring. We played in Europe. We had a really good time, and I think &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I learned a lot about being a bandleader from doing that for pretty strong personalities&lt;/span&gt;, trying to figure that out. It’s good, and then as time went on, people kind of drifted off and we disbanded, and I started writing a lot of pop songs. So I wrote a lot of pop songs with some artists who got signed and I got a publishing deal with EMI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Oh cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Um.. which, you know, that and $2.50 will get you on a subway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Great, Right! Yeah. [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: So &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I have a lot of experience demoing and writing pop songs, and I guess that does inform my weird music making too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yeah I bet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Because &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I know how to craft something into something that’s listenable but I also like weird things, so I like to marry those two things together.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Who are some of the weird influences that you’ve got?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4tKq1kc1RKk?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Oh man, well weird influences–let’s see. That’s a good question. I listened to a lot of early &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rambler_%28Bill_Frisell_album%29&quot;&gt;Bill Frisell - Rambler &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That album where they had 2 brass instruments. He had &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Wheeler&quot;&gt;Kenny Wheeler &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on flugelhorn and he had tuba player and he had electric bass and him and the drummer so like… high and low strings and high and low brass and a drummer. I like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And I listen to a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Garbarek&quot;&gt;Jan Garbarek &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He’s a Norwegian sax player who sounds like he’s playing in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fjord&quot;&gt;Fjords &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;–lot of reverb and &lt;em&gt;makes sounds&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I listen to a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://adrianbelew.net/&quot;&gt;Adrian Belew &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zappa.com/&quot;&gt;Zappa &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a lot of contemporary weird classical music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Like minimalist? Like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.philipglass.com/&quot;&gt;Phillip Glass &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stevereich.com/&quot;&gt;Steve Reich &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: No, I’m more into the harmonic stuff, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Satie&quot;&gt;(Erik) Satie &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parade_%28ballet%29&quot;&gt;Parade &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Yeah. And guitar-wise, I’m into all the typical sort of influences that everybody has I guess &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimi_Hendrix&quot;&gt;Hendrix &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Beck&quot;&gt;Jeff Beck &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Page&quot;&gt;Jimmy Page &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: &lt;em&gt;Eh.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I don’t meet many musicians who’d do that with Jimmy Page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Jimmy Page… I mean I love &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Led_Zeppelin&quot;&gt;Led Zeppelin &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I’m not like the guy who listen to Led Zeppelin and goes “Wow! I want to play all those guitar licks,” you know? But, I played them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Of course. 6 nights a week…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Well I had my band in 8th grade and we played all that stuff. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pinkfloyd.com&quot;&gt;Pink Floyd &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, then later on I listen to a lot of Frisell, and a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.johnscofield.com/&quot;&gt;John Scofield &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and that’s about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I just saw Scofield with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bradmehldau.com/&quot;&gt;Brad Mehldau &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://markguiliana.com/&quot;&gt;Mark Guiliana &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Oh Yeah?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Awesome show in New York.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Yeah. I love Mark. Mark has done the Loopestra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z4l0QmP8cks?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: That’s right! Yeah, I wanted to ask you about that. So the Loopestra–how did that get started? Did you first with the electronics, and get an idea, or…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Loopestra kind of came about because &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I wanted to have a band where I could write open ended songs that didn’t have a lot of changes, and I wanted to get another guitar player who would just play rhythm, and I could make weird noises over that and sing songs, but I couldn’t find anybody who would just play rhythm.&lt;/span&gt; Everybody wanted to have other roles, and as great as that could have been, it wasn’t what I wanted to do. And right about that time, Boss came out with a looper. [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: So I was like, “Well, sorry dude, you’re fired. I’m getting a looper!” and it turns out that worked well for me. I was able to exercise my production brain live with that, which isn’t to say that I do a lot of electronics stuff because sometimes it’s very organic and basic. Sometimes I can make it sound like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jamesbrown.com/&quot;&gt;James Brown &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes I can be totally bizarre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: How did you get in touch with the roster of people you’ve played with? Is just the years of working as a musician playing gigs that you’ve built that network? Or are you seeking out these people for specific sounds or talents?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: I think it started out–I wanted to have a set band when I started that, and then it’s New York city. Sometimes people can’t make $50 gigs, so I had to start mixing it up and then that became a thing. It became interesting to have a different drummer and bass player on the gig every time, because you’re making loops–and it’s not a lot of changes and there’s no rehearsal, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;so it ends up that they just had to bring their own personalities to the table, and they don’t know what’s going to happen either, so it’s exciting for them. They don’t have to have any preconceived notion of what’s going to happen.&lt;/span&gt; I try to tailor what I’m doing to what I think they’re going to bring, but then sometimes they surprise me and bring in something completely different than what I thought they were going to bring, so it’s really fun for me to get to play with all these guys and mix it up with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yeah it seems less like music performance and more like musical communication between 3 or 4 people at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: You don’t play the songs for the other guys beforehand generally unless they’ve done a gig with you before? Then they’re unfamiliar with what you’re going to do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Exactly, yeah. Yeah, I think when somebody wants to know what they should check out, I say, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;“Just go check yourself out. Check out your personality, alone in your apartment or meditate a little bit or something. I don’t know what to tell you, pal.”&lt;/span&gt; [laughs] That’s a really New York answer, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Yeah, but as far as the people who have done this… You’re doing this on a Monday night in New York, where all musicians have a day off and people come out, so they see it and they want to be part of it. Or I think, “Oh you know those 2 guys played with blah-blah-blah together. Maybe it’d be cool if they did it ‘cause they have a thing together.” I try to keep people together that have “a thing.” Then sometimes you can’t get people to play together a lot, so you have to put people together that never play together, then they evolve into having “a thing” also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Is this live dynamic performance a response to anything in your past? Like playing through-composed music by other people for so much of your career as a paid musician, doing these wedding gigs, club gigs and that kind of thing? Were you just craving this kind of live improvisation? Or is that always been part of your musical…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Good question. I would say, I’ve been jamming like that with my mom since I was a kid, where she would play organ and I would play piano. Even though I don’t really know how to play piano, I have ears and fingers, so I can kind of find and play in between, and we would have these epic half hour long jams that would just go from totally &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bizarro_World&quot;&gt;bizarro world &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;–but very reactionary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;She would play something, I’d answer. And she doesn’t really consider herself an improviser necessarily. She’s got great ears, but she’s a classical musician, so everything she’s drawing from is something that has been played before. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;But I had no idea what that was most of the time, so I was just sort of hearing my way through it.&lt;/span&gt; And I guess, that’s always been part of my M.O.–jamming and playing extended things as it’s always been fun for me. But equally I like the set forms too, so thankfully I get to do both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yeah! Are your sets unplanned with the Loopestra?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: I don’t even think about it. I just go on stage and sort of go, “Ok, what song do I have here? Maybe I’ll sing that song.” You know? Start something and go, “Nah, I don’t want to sing that song for this. It sounds like this other song.” Because it could go either way. I have some preconceived little loopy ideas that I do for some songs, but instead  probably a third of the time, I’ll sing something else over it, just to mix it up and push the thing into an unknown territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: We didn’t actually say what the Loopestra was! We didn’t talk about it. What IS the Loopestra, and how do you tell people about it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;The Loopestra is a band that has a rotating cast, and rotating guitar parts&lt;/span&gt; [laughs] via loopers. So the way it works is, you get a couple of people playing bass and drums. You get a looper, you make a loop. The drummer goes, “Oh, I know what to play with that.” He does it, and then the bass player says, “Oh I don’t really like that chord. I’m going to play something totally to make it into another chord.” Hopefully he’ll do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yeah. I watched one of your gigs. Most of them are on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/TeddyKumpel&quot;&gt;your Youtube channel&lt;/a&gt;. Or many of them… I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: It’s extensive, the library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: It is!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: They run screaming. [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: What’s amazing to me is, you’d play a loop, and my ears think, “Oh I get it.” And then the drummer would come in and do something totally off the wall, like…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/paRYPRpUfVk?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: And it completely changes the direction of the song. Even just for 8 or 16 measures. Do you get a thrill out of that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Yeah!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: It’s not confusing for you or anything? [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;/em&gt; it’s confusing. I love it when it goes to the edge of the cliff and you really have to pay attention. It just makes you pay attention when they do that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So tell me about the edge of the cliff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Okay… well &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;if you’re playing a gig where you’d know everything that you’re going to play, you’re not on the edge of the cliff&lt;/span&gt;, which is fine ‘cause you have thing that you’re going to do and that’s a performance. It’s a different kind of edge of the cliff, let’s say, because there are subtleties that could come out in a live performance that don’t come up every time, but you kind of have to cover the bases of what the thing is, right? Like with Joe [Jackson], he’d have set parts, and then with Loopestra, since you have no idea what it’s going to be, basically, it forces you to listen, I guess, that’s the only way to… you’re all sort of holding hands and jumping off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I’m assuming these other musicians also enjoy being on the edge of the cliff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;T: Some more than the others. [laughs] Yes. Some of them have gone “Was that good? I don’t even know.” When they say that, I’m like, “That means it was good.” &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;When you think you don’t know, that’s where you want to live for this gig.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I love that, oh man, that’s good… and what about audiences?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Well… that’s an interesting point, because it can get self indulgent if a drummer, let’s say, decides that he’s going to be Mr. Odd-time-weirdo-loud-non-dynamic-guy, the ladies in the audience would not be happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;However, if the drummer decides that he’s going to be Mr. Pay-attention-to-the-room, look around, see who’s holding their ears, every dynamic, super groove oriented, sometimes a little bit spicy, weird for taste, then the ladies will hang. [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Xzm0ON4iDo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: And your gigs are… I mean I watched one at the Smithtown public library. I was born in Smithtown, so it was like, “oh!”…. and my aunt  does a lot of political work there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: There you go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So it was cool, but you could tell, at least, listening, there seemed to be a lot of older women in the audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Those older women loved it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yeah?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: I think partially, because of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Pelton&quot;&gt;Shawn Pelton&lt;/a&gt;, the guy who’s playing drums with me… He’s good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: He’s great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: He’s the master at it. He knows how to make it happen. They’re eating it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: And you had no bass player. It was just the two of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Yeah, yeah. I played some bass parts in that show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So what is your… has your electronics rig kind of grown into something to support the Loopestra?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Yeah, because it’s all about sort of on-the-fly access to a wide variety of sounds. I’ve cultivated, you know of, an array of probably… I don’t know, I have never counted them, but maybe there’s 40 levels of little tidbits of information there that could be turned on and off, and I’m generally a one-at-a-time kind of guy. I’m not a big fan of turning on 17 different effects at the same time and seeing what happens… I’m more of a very specific and, you know, “Let’s get a delay” &lt;em&gt;makes sounds&lt;/em&gt;, “rock guitar chord on a down beat,” “let’s get another thing”… &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;and then you just build a vocabulary within the framework. So it’s… in that respect, it’s not completely improvised, because you do have you know, when you’re speaking words, you know words, and they’re going to come up in sentences, right?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yep. But you’re pretty busy. I mean, when you’re playing, it’s not just the guy playing guitar. I mean, you’re turning loops on and off, you’re changing the pitch, you’re shifting the pitch of what you’re playing. What are some of the tools of your trade in the Loopestra?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: That’s the looping aspect of it, yeah. The previous thing I talked about was the sound element, where you have a variety of sound. But for the looping aspect, I have a rig set up to go through 2 diff amps in stereo, so one thing can come out in the right and one thing can come out in the left. I’m not a fan of stereo effects necessarily, where things are like ping-ponging back and forth between 2 amps. I’m more of a fan of it sounding like a record where there’s a rhythm guitar player on the right, and a bass guitar player on the left. Those things can go away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So I have a way of turning off a whole side of information. I have a way of turning off a specific loop, so I have access to making 4 loops at a time, and they can all be on both sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Oh, ok. So you’re signal routing in addition to thinking about what you’re playing, in addition to thinking about what instrument your guitar’s going to be sounding like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So you’re thinking texturally, sonically, spatially…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Was that super difficult at first?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: I mean, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;it took me about 2 years to develop the rig to the point where I liked it&lt;/span&gt;. So, yeah. When I first started out, I had a Boss looper that had a guide track in it, and I would experiment with it by putting the guide track through an amp, so it was sort of like a drum machine playing all the time through this amp that the drummer could hear, and it was just–that had to always be there. It was annoying. So I figured, “Ok, I have to figure out a way to have a click track,” because otherwise how are you going to stay in time with the loops?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Now, that’s an interesting point, because some people would say, “Well, why don’t you just have a basic rhythm loop going to the drummer’s headphones and then he could always hear that and play along with it, right?”. Is that something that somebody would say?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Somebody would say that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: I’ve heard that many times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I believe you’re correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: So, I tried that, and recorded it, and listened to it and I decided that - A) I don’t always want to have the beginning of the song have rhythm guitar, sometimes I want it to be ambient.  B) When I’m in a recording session with the drummer, and I’m playing funky guitar, that thing is not metronomically correct necessarily. It sounds funkier when the rhythm guitar, at least my style of it, is sort of behind the beat, or sort of messing around with the beat, or…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Kind of what &lt;a href=&quot;/interview/ben-levin&quot;&gt;Ben Levin&lt;/a&gt; was talking about where he’d find an equal amount of time and it doesn’t have to be accurate, that’s what it gives it interest?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Right, exactly. So I mean if I’m playing a reggae groove… I’m going to go “&lt;em&gt;um&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;click&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;um&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;click&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;um&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;click&lt;/em&gt;…”. I’m going to go, ““&lt;em&gt;um&lt;/em&gt; (slight delay) &lt;em&gt;click&lt;/em&gt; (shorter delay)&lt;em&gt;um&lt;/em&gt; (slight delay) &lt;em&gt;click&lt;/em&gt; (shorter delay)&lt;em&gt;um&lt;/em&gt; (shorter delay) &lt;em&gt;click&lt;/em&gt;.” Like swinging a little bit, or doing something weird with it, or play a 32nd note behind just for one of them. And the drummer knows what’s going on, because he could hear the click and me doing that against the click. So he can go “Oh, I see” right away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And these guys are pros. They’re not messing around. So they’re not going to hear that and go, “Oh no, what’s going on?” They’d hear it and go, “I see, Teddy’s being weird. Ok, cool.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: That’s interesting. So do you find that, or did you find when you’re doing the rhythmic looping in the ears… was that introducing bias into your choices while you were performing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Bias in terms of…?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Well, you might hear something and go “Oh well, that’s what I’m hearing in my hears, and just going to play to that, or was that constraining you at all, in the choices you were making…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Hearing the click?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: It sounded like you had at some point kind of a rhythm or drum or something before the click.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Oh THAT thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Yeah, well with that thing, it was like a beat that would always be on, so you couldn’t turn it off, and you couldn’t get away from it, and it sounded really gross and it wasn’t helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: And it was always in 4/4?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: No. The Boss has many different time signatures that all sound equally terrible. They designed that thing for a guy who’s playing by himself at a Holiday Inn lobby who is going to play his Bossanova, you know, (sings) “I just called to say I love you”, and he needs a Bossa beat, and he’s going to play like a little guitar and solo over it, and maybe he’ll loop some background vocals later in the song or something. So they design it for that. They didn’t design it for somebody who’s going to get weird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Right. You’re exploiting the tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;A: I’m seeing a lot of people do this kind of one-man-band kind of thing, and layering percussion, salt shakers, whatever, but it seems that you’re primary sticking to the guitar and your loops. Have you explored building loops in that just aren’t guitar?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: I used to play kazoo or sing some stuff into the looper. I like that. It can be fun. That makes the setup bigger, which in New York isn’t necessarily good. But sometimes I still do that. I really don’t have any interest in being a 1-man band at all, so my thinking was never along those lines and how to get good at that. I always wanted it to be bass player and drummer and guitar trio with the extra stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Do you ever, or are you inspired by any particular people doing looping?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/UXyHf_SpUUI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: The most inspiring guy to me is the guy who does this most simplest and the most one-man band, which is &lt;a href=&quot;http://reggiewatts.com&quot;&gt;Reggie Watts &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He is so good. The guy–just his feel, like how he can make something quarter notes so amazing. I’m a huge fan of him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I’m trying to get him for this site at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: He’d be great. I know his bass player really well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Oh. I’ll have to reach out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Might have to talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;A: Yeah! Did you ever try something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ableton.com/&quot;&gt;Abelton &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is built a lot around song structure, components, pieces?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: I’ve tried that, and I’ve found, for me, the foot pedal thing, is more solid as a tech on a gig for me. I know a lot of people that use that live and that’s fine. But I guess something with computers and me on a stage just doesn’t work really well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It kind of makes one more thing to bring, and it does open up a lot more possibilities of what you can actually do, but that doesn’t necessarily help me. I think the limitations in my rig help. I think it’s good that I can only turn off one side at a time, or, you know, it’s…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I agree. Constraints are a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Yeah, so I use an &lt;a href=&quot;http://pigtronix.com/infinity/&quot;&gt;Infinity Looper &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: What’s that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: That’s a &lt;a href=&quot;http://pigtronix.com&quot;&gt;Pigtronix &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; looper. It has stereo in and stereo out and it has reverse pitch, has undo, has many, many different functions I think probably all the same ones that Ableton has, except instead of the foot pedal. Then I usejjjjj the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tcelectronic.com/ditto-x4-looper/&quot;&gt;TC Electronic Ditto 4 &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, that has some kind of weird–like, you can do stutter effects &lt;em&gt;makes sounds&lt;/em&gt;. You can do tape slow down &lt;em&gt;makes sounds&lt;/em&gt; stuff. [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: That’s cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: I always like to sing the effect when I’m telling the person. Is that ok? [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;A: Yeah! Absolutely. That’s why we’re here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: This stems from a New York session that I got called for once, where my friend Joey called me up and goes (in New Yorker accent) “Hey Teddy, I need you to come down here. I need you to bring your guitar, and need you to bring a (&lt;em&gt;makes sounds&lt;/em&gt;) phase shifter, and I need you to bring a &lt;em&gt;makes sounds&lt;/em&gt; wah wah.” This is a phone message that I got… it was just the classic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I know so many people that talk just like that! [laughs] That’s awesome! How did you get hooked up with Joe Jackson?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Joe Jackson sent out an email to probably 20 of his ex-bandmates, or people he knew in the music business to try to find a guitar player who could sing and was good with effects. So one of them who used to play with him, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cdbaby.com/Artist/AndyEzrin&quot;&gt;Andy Ezrin &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this keyboard player guy I know from college, got the email, and he sent it to me, and said, “Hey, you should do this, audition for Joe!”  and I said, “Oh yeah, I love Joe!” So I sent Joe an email, and 6 other people recommended me, and then I got to audition for him, and he was super cool, and we hit it off right away! There you go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: When was this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: This was last summer, about a year ago&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Oh wow, this was pretty recent for you. You’ve been touring with him on and off from the past year?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Yeah, this is our third tour. We did a US tour in October and November, and we did an European tour in the Winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Do you play with any other acts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Right now? No, I’m busy enough with Joe and…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I mean in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Oh, yeah, sure I’ve done a lot of stuff. I mean, played with &lt;a href=&quot;http://rickieleejones.com/&quot;&gt;Rickie Lee Jones &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for a month on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: That must have been fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: You know, I grew up listening to her, and I think kind of learned how to sing from her. So for me, it was a really spiritual experience to be with her and sing backgrounds with her and she liked my singing. She was really nice to me about that. But then right after that she went on to do another kind of project that she had a band up in California for, so we lost touch. But, yeah, I really enjoyed playing with her. She’s great–really freaky, kind of free-spirit. I did a background vocals gig for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nin.com/&quot;&gt;Nine Inch Nails &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; once, that was pretty amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/chNPM-rUCwI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: In studio, or live?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: It was MTV Music Awards 1999. So it was at the Metropolitan Opera House, and it was 6 days of rehearsal for one song, and it was pretty deep, man. Trent really–he’s some detailed oriented stuff. Really amazing, and to watch him work and be control in every aspect.. lights, movement on stage, every single little detail he was into. It was very eye opening. It watched the dedication and hard work he put into it. It was pretty amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Trying to think of other people I’ve played with. I do of one-off things. I did a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today_(U.S._TV_program)&quot;&gt;Today Show &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; appearance with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feist_%28singer%29&quot;&gt;Feist &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It was pretty fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: My wife LOVES Feist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Feist is great. I knew her before she was famous too, and she’s been fun to watch her to do her thing. She’s so great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yeah. We found out about her through &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kings_of_Convenience&quot;&gt;Kings of Convenience &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Do you know them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_%26_Garfunkel&quot;&gt;Simon and Garfunkel &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;-type out of Norway. She did several songs with them on their albums but no one knew who she was. Great voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Yeah, amazing. I did a lot of playing with this guy, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Brown_(Canadian_musician)&quot;&gt;Chris Brown &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who’s a Canadian producer. Actually him and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Fenner&quot;&gt;Kate Fenner &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, his song writing partner and band mate - they were in this band called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_Tabernacle_Choir&quot;&gt;Bourbon Tabernacle Choir &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the, I guess the 80s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Great name!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/2g77t_CnYM8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: That band, became &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_Social_Scene&quot;&gt;Broken Social Scene &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so Chris and Kate split off as their own thing, and the rest of the people kind of went on to be involved with Broken Social Scene, which is where Feist came from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Okay, interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: So it’s like a whole Canadian contingent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: You mentioned that you sang with your family growing up. But then, focused primarily on guitar after that. But I’m sure, obviously that you sing and play guitar. Anything about your vocal development - is that something you’ve focused on particularly hard or is it just natural coming from your family?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Both, I think. I always sang when I was a kid. I was in the all-state choir. Chorus in high school, I was always singing. I never really sang pop songs until college, when I did those top-40 gigs. I sort of just learned by listening to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_Wonder&quot;&gt;Stevie Wonder &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Gabriel&quot;&gt;Peter Gabriel &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and Rickie Lee, kind of emulating my heroes. I used to always joke that my warm up was a hamburger and a cigarette for singing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;This was back in the old days. Now I think it’s just drinking a lot of water and humming a lot helps, but I don’t have any real philosophy of singing, except to… it’s sort of the same on the guitar. I’m not a… &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I studied the guitar a lot, and come to realization that being yourself is the most important thing - so… doesn’t require thought to do that necessarily. It’s more like getting.. you can study a lot and get a lot of things together on the guitar, but really what you want… what I want to do is to have a direct connection between my emotions, I guess, or soul, or whatever you want to call it to the instrument. So there’s no filter between those things. Just whatever you come up with on the spot is what you’re going to do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Tell me how you developed to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: I think just doing it. I don’t know. &lt;span class=&quot;importnat&quot;&gt;I don’t think there’s any way to develop that except by–you can’t think that through. You can have that philosophy, and say that’s what I’m going to do, and then you do it, then realize, “Oh, it takes a lot more relaxation than sort of mind over matter kind of focus to get to that than you think it does.” You’re sort of getting into your own way, right?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Absolutely! Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: You study technique. You study other people’s music, but there’s no real instruction on who are you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Do you feel like that you’ve found yourself musically a long time ago, or is that been fairly recent?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: I think by the early 90s, I was fairly well in myself, yeah. I’ve learned how to do that better over the years, and &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I think playing with other people, and being a side man helps me find my voice within other music, which helps me find my own voice within my music too, you know. So they all kind of go hand in hand.&lt;/span&gt; There’s no real one moment when I said, “Oh yeah, now I’m who I’m supposed to be.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: I know people who’ve had that, and I’m always like, “Wow.” Sometimes through drugs and I’m like, “Wow, well, I’m glad I didn’t have to do THAT to get there!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yeah, no kidding. What about relaxation? What makes you emphasize that as your key points?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I think when your mind is focused and relaxed, you can let more of yourself through&lt;/span&gt;, you know. You’re not uptight about what’s going to happen, or pre-thinking what’s going to happen, necessarily, even if it’s set music, if it’s something that’s pre-decided or prearranged, you’ve got to be in the moment. You can’t be thinking, “Oh, here it comes! That part… oh geez! [laughs] &lt;em&gt;makes Groan noise&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: “There it went!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Brace for it! [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: The word “weird” in Make Weird Music is more about that, like finding your voice, and realizing that you’re not someone else, musically - that if you’re trying to be somebody else, then you’re not being weird. Everyone’s weird. Can you tell me your take on “weird” and why we’re here? {: .interviewer }&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/e1BiSGOOuR4?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Liebman&quot;&gt;Dave Liebman &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you know who that is? Saxophone player? Played with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Davis&quot;&gt;Miles Davis &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, really amazing teacher and player. I was lucky enough to sit in on one of his saxophone clinics for Dave, because I drove my friend there, and he said something that blew me away. He said that there’s 3 stages… real New York guy, (&lt;em&gt;in New York accent&lt;/em&gt;,) &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;“3 stages to every musician’s career. You’ve got imitator, everybody starts at imitating - gotta do it. 2nd stage. Stylist. You became yourself within a style of music. Very good for you. 3rd stage. Innovator - nobody gets there. Couple of guys.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So like.. wow, that’s brilliant, and sort of like encapsulates the whole thing, you know. I’d be happy to be myself within a style of music, whatever that style is. I guess my style is sort of incorporating a lot of styles together, which you’d like to think it makes a new style, but really it’s a bunch of things mixed together. So, it’s up to the critics to decide if it’s a new style or not, I suppose. Did I answer your question? [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Sure. Whatever [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Question shmestion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I don’t even know why I’m here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So, I really appreciate you taking the time to tell us all about yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: I appreciate you coming all the way over here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Thanks a lot Teddy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Thanks for having me! Appreciate it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Thanks man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;A: Alright! Thanks Conan!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Discover Phish</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-little-about-phish&quot;&gt;A LITTLE ABOUT PHISH&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phish is an improvisation-focused rock quartet formed in Burlington, Vermont and consisting of members &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trey_Anastasio&quot;&gt;Trey Anastasio &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (guitars, lead vocals), &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Gordon&quot;&gt;Mike Gordon &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (bass, vocals), &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Fishman&quot;&gt;Jon Fishman &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (drums, percussion, vacuum, vocals), and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_McConnell&quot;&gt;Page McConnell &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (keyboards, vocals). Their stylistically whimsical and genre-defying music includes hints of rock, jazz, country, progressive rock, folk, funk, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-so-weird&quot;&gt;WHAT’S SO WEIRD?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of Phish’s work makes use of the following weird music techniques:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Time Signatures&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Composition&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Virtuosity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Humor&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Surrealism&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Atonality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-i-care&quot;&gt;WHY I CARE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 1995 my musical interests were deeply rooted in the psychedelic blues of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd&quot;&gt;Pink Floyd &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the statistical density of composers like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Stravinsky&quot;&gt;Stravinsky &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravel&quot;&gt;Ravel &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/frank-zappa&quot;&gt;Zappa&lt;/a&gt;. My ears were ever searching for interesting harmonies, complex &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyrhythm&quot;&gt;polyrhythms &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atonality&quot;&gt;atonal &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consonance_and_dissonance&quot;&gt;dissonance &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; while also maintaining roots in groove oriented blues and rock. It was a crossroad in my life. I was graduating from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrash_metal&quot;&gt;thrash &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_metal&quot;&gt;death metal &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoner_rock&quot;&gt;70s stoner rock &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to more sophisticated rock music stylings. Coming from a history lightly battered in classical music sensibilities, I was lucky enough to have developed a bit of an ear for the weird and unorthodox in music and was well on my way to discovering and becoming engrossed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_rock&quot;&gt;Progressive Rock &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was about this time that a good friend and accomplice in music recommended I take a listen to a weird little band from Vermont called Phish. What struck me first was the name: Phish. I mean, why was it spelled that way? The first album I tucked into was called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junta_(album)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Junta&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; another oddity in nomenclature. Needless to say, I was right off the bat intrigued. My intrigue heightened when I learned that they had a fan newsletter called &lt;a href=&quot;http://forum.phish.net/forum/show/1303154865&quot;&gt;Doniac Schvice &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which was comprised of nonsensical stories, poems, puzzles, anecdotes, instructions and surreal art provided ‘from fish to tongue.’ I haven’t even heard the music yet and I’m having fun. This should be good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listening to &lt;em&gt;Junta&lt;/em&gt; was, for me, a pretty life changing experience. I had simply never heard any music like this (this was before I found &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatfield_and_the_North&quot;&gt;Hatfield and the North &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health&quot;&gt;National Health &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but more on that in another discovery). It was comical, cartoonish, whimsical, dark, surreal, absurdist, atonal, harmonic, virtuosic, psychedelic and rocking all at once. Until I found (and subsequently became obsessed with) Zappa, I had never heard something so bizarrely unique in rock music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/CzWqHvSkQZI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the next–well, still actually, I followed the career of this band eating up everything I could get my ears on. I got all their albums which, as it turned out, only scratched the surface of their body of work. I learned that their live shows were ever changing and that no two performances ever sounded the same as they were incredible improvisors that made a point to explore musicality at every show. Songs became ‘vehicles’ of sonic exploration and going to a Phish show typically entailed getting tickets to several concurrent shows or following the band on tour a la the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead&quot;&gt;Grateful Dead &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to hear all the different permutations of their songs via improvisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But all comparisons to the Grateful Dead aside, Phish has maintained an incredible body of work that is altogether weird, beautiful, organic, dissonant, and exploratory. As far as weird music is concerned, Phish, in my opinion, should be touted up alongside Zappa, &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/the-residents&quot;&gt;The Residents&lt;/a&gt;, and others as a cornerstone of the ‘genre.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-you-should-hear-first&quot;&gt;WHAT YOU SHOULD HEAR FIRST&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to pinpoint specific albums for different ideas because each record covers so much ground. Also, the recorded works are really only a fraction of what’s available to enjoy. So I’ll cover a few compositions that are core to the Phish experience and you can explore as you will from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a well-rounded ‘This is Phish’ experience: &lt;em&gt;Harry Hood&lt;/em&gt; off of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Live_One&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Live One&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Reba&lt;/em&gt; off of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawn_Boy&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lawn Boy&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. There is also an amazing live rendition available on YouTube &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/cnJlBWjDeXA&quot;&gt;here &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/AKmIV1SY9gY&quot;&gt;here &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/cnJlBWjDeXA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For completely weird, Zappa-esque outlandishness: &lt;em&gt;David Bowie&lt;/em&gt; off of &lt;em&gt;Junta&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Split Open and Melt&lt;/em&gt; off of &lt;em&gt;Lawn Boy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For compositional complexity: &lt;em&gt;All Things Reconsidered&lt;/em&gt; off of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rift_(album)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rift&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Fluffhead/Fluff’s Travels&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Junta&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For balls-to-the-wall guitar rock: &lt;em&gt;Chalkdust Torture&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Picture_of_Nectar&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Picture of Nectar&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Run Like an Antelope&lt;/em&gt;, again from &lt;em&gt;Lawn Boy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For wonderful melody and songwriting: &lt;em&gt;Horn&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Rift&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Esther&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Junta&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Divided Sky&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Junta&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you’re looking for something REALLY out there, check out &lt;em&gt;Dave’s Energy Guide&lt;/em&gt; or any improvisation labeled &lt;a href=&quot;http://phish.net/song/daves-energy-guide&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;DEG&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Phish has provided so much improvised content over their career that there is a meta-labeling system to help categorize different ‘types of jams’ from their library of work).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be foolish to try and pigeonhole Phish’s music into a specific label or category. They simply do too much different shit to fit into a single bucket.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>33 in Buffalo</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-context&quot;&gt;Some Context&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I posted the &lt;a href=&quot;/interview/steve-vai&quot;&gt;Steve Vai interview&lt;/a&gt;, MWM started getting a lot of attention. I got an email from Robbie while he was in Europe traveling with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/BannedFromUtopia/&quot;&gt;Banned from Utopia&lt;/a&gt; in October 2015. We ended up having a lot in common and connected via Facebook. He sent me a copy of his wonderful record and some YouTube videos and I knew we had to chat. So, we met on a rooftop in Manhattan while I was traveling for work and we made some MWM content. And here we are!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;video-transcript&quot;&gt;Video Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;Ant: This is Anthony with Make Weird Music and I’m here with Robbie Seahag Mangano.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Robbie: Hi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: And, Robbie, why don’t you tell us about what you’re going to show us from your album, &lt;a href=&quot;http://treb-c-moon.wix.com/fullmoonfever&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Full Moon Fever&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;R: Okay. As you’ve requested to see about &lt;em&gt;33 in Buffalo&lt;/em&gt;… The number 33 actually has to do with the time signature of that whole riff. So it’s 10 notes, then another 10, then another 10, and then 3. So we got 33.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Is that in standard tuning?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;R: It’s in standard tuning. A friend of mine thought it was without open strings, but that sounds a little too hard to figure out. This was actually pretty hard to figure out because of this little move right there [hiding the middle finger under the others to slide on the high e string].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Ahhh… I was trying to slide with my pinky on the B string when I was figuring it out, but the fingering was too big.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;R: And that last note, I pick with the middle finger [on the right hand] because I’m never going to get the pick there in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Where did the song come from? What inspired it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;R: I play all day at home. Not all day, but there’s a guitar in a stand and the rest of them in cases all over the place. But, I pick it up and if I come across something I’ve never played before and try to get good at it. Especially if there’s a mistake. So that one came out as–maybe the notes came one at a time. And I wanted these notes instead of something easy like [plays an alternate phrase with open strings].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Oh, that’s cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;R: And also, it has a lot to do with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_Encounters_of_the_Third_Kind#Soundtrack&quot;&gt;Close Encounters theme &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also influenced by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaco_Pastorius&quot;&gt;Jaco Pastorius &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; song.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Oh, which one?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;R: It’s off &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaco_Pastorius_(album)&quot;&gt;his first solo record &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the one with the harmonics. I can’t remember the name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/v_kv_UjIM7Y?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: It’s a girl’s name, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;R: No, that’s Portrait of Tracy. This ostinato thing and he has a horn going and that sounds like my thing. So that’s where I think that kind of comes from, loving those melodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Right! Those intervals. Did you intend to write something in 10 + 10 + 10 + 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;R: Yes. At that point, I was thinking about the number 33 a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Interesting. Why’s that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;R: I’m into numbers. I’m not really sure why. Percentage is an interesting thing when there’s 3 people and there’s a split-up of something and it’s 33 1/3. If you’re going to split anything up it’s that 33 thing. That 33.333333. And they say that Jesus died at 33. It’s not like they would really know, but maybe there’s this secretive 33 thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Right. The freemasons and the 33rd degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;R: Right! I don’t know much about it, but if you do, let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: And what about the next part of the song? What about that? How do you play that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;R: I wanted to make 100, so I added one more note. Something about 33.33333 makes me unstable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: It’s unsettling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;R: So when I got to the last note, it’s 99 when I do it 3 times. So when I hit this last one, it’s 100.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: If you get paid by the note on this song, then you know exactly how much to charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;R: Exactly. First verse is $100. There’s overdubs on the next section [plays harmonies].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we start talking through the chords and intervals. And we wrap it up.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Zon Michael Manring Hyperbass</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;zon-michael-manring-hyperbass&quot;&gt;Zon Michael Manring Hyperbass&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was a teenager, I saw a video of Michael Manring playing a 3-octave bass with dynamic tuning capabilities and sorta became obsessed with the idea of owning one. In the late 1990s, the price was around $7,000. A brief Google search yields used ones for ~$10,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/interview/michael-manring&quot;&gt;Don’t know who Michael Manring is? Check out our interview with him! &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was always a fantasy of mine to see him play live, so I flew him out to our house for a house concert (video coming soon!) in April 2016. Not only did I get to see Michael play, but I got to have his wonderful instruments in my home for a few hours! Michael was gracious enough to do an interview about the instrument before the show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interview-video&quot;&gt;Interview video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a video of the interview:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interview-transcript&quot;&gt;Interview transcript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;Anthony: Hey, this is Anthony from MakeWeirdMusic.com and I’m here with Michael Manring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Michael: Hi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Uh, in my bedroom studio. So, thank you for traveling out here, Michael.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: My pleasure. Thank you for having me, Anthony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So, I wanted to talk about instruments that provide a unique voice for musicians and you certainly have one of those instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: I know something about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So, can you tell us about the bass you have today?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Yeah, this is officially known as the “Zon Michael Manring Hyperbass.” It’s a bass that Joe Zon and I designed together almost 25 years ago now and the idea was that there were a lot of different design possibilities that we wanted to try out on an instrument. We kind of decided, “Well, let’s put them all on one instrument and see what happens.” We weren’t banking on it being a success. It’s a prototype. That’s what it is; an experiment to see what would work and what didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;We ended up–I was gonna say we ended up being lucky, but what happened is Joe Zon is just really good at what he does and everything works beautifully. So, the instrument really works so well as an integrated whole, but it’s kind of its own beast and it’s just been a joy for me. It’s really opened up a whole lot of possibilities that wouldn’t be there otherwise. It’s a thrill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So what makes this instrument different from a regular 4-string fretless bass?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: So, a couple things. Probably the most obvious design change in this is the fingerboard is especially long. A standard bass fingerboard ends about here [points at the 21st fret] and then there’s a standard that ends here [points at the 24th fret] and this little bit is almost an additional octave because the notes get closer together as you go up the neck. So, extending it this far gives a lot more range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;However, the idea behind this wasn’t necessarily about having more range as much as it was we couldn’t figure out why not to do it. We knew where we wanted the pickup to be and we couldn’t think of why the fingerboard should end at some point before that and so we thought, “Well, we’ll just extend the fingerboard to the pickup and see what happens.” I don’t tend to do a lot of direct playing in this last little area of the fingerboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Occasionally it’s real nice to have. But, there’s other things that happen because I have fingerboard there that have ended up being really, really exciting. There’s lots of sounds I can make on that part of the fingerboard with my picking hand, my right hand, that really have become an important part of what I do. So that’s been a really nice thing and as time goes on, I’ve been kind of working on playing in this super stratosphere. It’s really kind of nice to have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;With bass, you’re always kind of running out of notes when you’re going for that extreme moment. That’s never going to happen on this instrument. There’s always more to play than I can usually manage to get to. So that’s the first thing about this. And then Joe decided to do a real deep cutaway so it’s not too hard to get up here. I have to kind of decide to go on top of the cutaway or underneath it in my fingerings that I use. And I’ll do either one depending on what kind of passage I’m playing, but it’s kind of nice to have that option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Is it the full width of the body behind the neck? Is there any sort of special shaping for your hand to reach?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: There’s no bevel. It’s just a straight cut back and in instruments we’ve been doing since this one–as I said, this one was the first prototype like this–he’s been doing some different shaping with that part of the instrument to see what works. It’s a lot of fun. I don’t know if there’s a right or wrong way to do it, but it’s kind of nice to see what can be done. So, yeah, that’s kind of the first thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Another interesting thing about this instrument that’s not immediately visible is the electronics. We wanted to do some different things with the electronics on this instrument and so one of the things that’s happening is underneath this pickup cover, there’s four separate pickups, one for each string. There’s a humbucking pickup for each string. So that gives me the ability to plug each string into a different amplifier or a different channel in a mixing board and really deal with each string individually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And this is something I’d been wanting to do for a long time and I just find really thrilling because it just opens up a ton of things you can do. I suppose it’s kind of obvious that you can do completely bizarre, crazy things, like put a massive amount of fuzz tone on one string and have the others clean, and that’s a lot of fun. But, often I’ll just use it kind of subtly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;If I’m recording–I use it mostly when I’m recording solo bass music and so I can have, for instance, the same reverb sound across all four strings, but it can be shorter on the low strings so I can have a rich reverb that doesn’t cloud up as much. I can have different kinds of compression on each string, all kinds of EQ, and panning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I can do panning differently with the strings and that’s something that has ended up being really thrilling to me. Just the panning thing alone, the sound that it makes really is something that really impresses me. If you have sound moved across a sonic canvas of some kind, it really behaves in a different way than if it’s all coming out of one thing. So, right, so that’s the quadrophonic magnetic pickup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;In addition to those four outputs, Joe built into the body ceramic pickups. There’s one up here [by the horn], one down here [on the lower horn], there’s one here [by the arm rest], and there’s one up here [in the headstock by the truss rod] in the headstock. And then the signal from those goes back here [flips over the bass]. There’s a little trim pot mixer, these little trim pots you can move with your fingernail so you can decide how much of each of those you want to have in the mix, so if you want to have just one in a separate output, you can do that. You can do different things with that where you can mix in different ways. And that comes out on a fifth output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;All these outputs work together out of a really nice multi-output jack by a company called Lemo Jack. It was a very expensive, groovy part of this instrument, using this Lemo Jack to do the multiple output. In addition to that, Joe figured out how all of those could be summed together so I could play this instrument in mono. I was so excited about these possibilities that it never really occurred to me that it’s kind of wildly impractical to have five inputs any time you want to play the instrument, so Joe built a mono output into this instrument as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;All these outputs are summed and you can still control the mix of the transducers, which is nice, and those come out a regular 1/4” output, just like any other instrument, and in fact, that’s the one I end up using most of the time just because it’s logistically so much easier. But, I love recording with the multiple output. So, that’s kind of the electronic aspect of this instrument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And then finally, probably the most bizarre thing about this instrument is that we designed it for dynamic tuning. For many years, I’d been interested in using different tunings on the bass. The bass is incredibly receptive to altered tunings and when you change the tuning, these kind of wonderful magical things happen. I just got very into this concept and realized there’s so much you can do with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;There’s so many different tunings you can do with the bass that I really wanted to keep moving beyond that and to go to the next level with it. And one of the places I wanted to go was into this area of dynamic tuning. So, not only is it about using these unusual tunings for the bass, these altered non-standard tunings on the bass, but being able to move those and change through those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I started trying to do that just by turning the tuning keys while I was playing. And that’s okay, you can kind of do a little bit with that, but I really wanted to take it a lot further than that and that was probably the biggest challenge from a design standpoint. Joe and I talked about this for a long time and talked about various systems we could do and we designed a few systems that we couldn’t afford to build. But we ended up with this system, which has really worked amazingly well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;What’s happening is that here at the headstock, we are using Hipshot Extender Keys. And this is actually a relatively standard add-on device for a bass. It’s designed to be put on your low string, typically on the low E string, and the tuning key sits on a kind of plate and when I move this lever, the whole tuning key tilts, just the tension of the string causes the tuning key to tilt. You can use that to drop your E string to a D or a C or a B. Really whatever you want. You can set it up with this little set screw in the back. And so these are two right-handed Hipshots and these are two left-handed Hipshots. I have one on each string here and it allows me to change the tuning of each string individually here at the headstock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Can you play us just a few notes to show us how it works?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Sure! [Plays harmonics and changes tunings.] So it’s a really nice tool to have. It really opens up a lot of possibilities. One of the things I discovered is that I really like the sound of the tunings moving. Just how it sounds when the bass moves, which is not something I expected necessarily and I often write pieces around that, just the moving of the tunings because to me it’s an appealing sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So in addition to this system, we did a system here at the bridge as well because we really wanted to do as much as we could at the time given the constraints of the technology and the amount of money we had to put into this. So, this bridge is one that Zon makes and it’s a little hard to explain. What happens is each string kind of sits on a kind of a tray and underneath the bridge, so they’re basically flat on one side and rounded on the other and these levers turn the cams. The trays, there are little set screws on the trays, and when I turn the cams, that causes the trays to move up and down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;You can set what you want the tunings to be with the set screws in the bridge. The bridge is designed to do three different tunings. You have a high tuning, a medium tuning, and a low tuning, more or less whatever you want within some limits. It depends on a lot of things like the gauge of the string and the tension of the string, things like that. Even how you set up the bridge makes a difference. But it does give you some really cool possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;As you move through the tunings in the bridge, you don’t have to have all the strings change, too. I usually set this bridge up, in fact, so that from the high position to the low position, the two high strings stay the same and then to the low position, dropping down all four strings. It doesn’t have to be that way, but it’s a thing I like to do with moving just two strings or all four or whatever you want to do. So, yeah, and then that moves all four strings like this. I’m moving all four strings a whole step. This is Bb, F, Bb, F and [flicks the cam on the bridge] now it’s Ab, Eb, Ab, Eb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So I use these two systems in combination to–it gives me a chance to go through a whole lot of tunings [manipulates both bridge and headstock tuners.] In one piece. And I think that’s pretty much it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: That is pretty incredible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Well, let’s get some footage of you playing. Let’s see if we can get this 5-output thing going. Thanks a lot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: You bet.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Homer Flynn Interview</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;special-thanks&quot;&gt;SPECIAL THANKS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extra special thanks to Mama Ralph (Lorrie Murray), social media director for The Residents, for making this happen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to Caustic Casey, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.causticcasey.com&quot;&gt;purveyor of Hellish Foods &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He manned the cameras and the audio recorder to ensure we had an error-free experience. Also, special thanks to Jenna at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/Reverie-Cafe-446696380600/&quot;&gt;Reverie Cafe &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in San Francisco for letting us set up and record in their beautiful garden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a video of the interview:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-context&quot;&gt;Some Context&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the most challenging interviews I’ve ever conducted. It was very difficult to interview a person about a nameless group of artists that’s, as he describes them, “a faceless façade.” There are a couple dozen interviews with Homer available online and most of the questions are the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people are concerned with the lore, particular releases, the story of the group. I’m more interested with the process, the art, and the creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus, I was a little nervous all day about not screwing up the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I don’t believe I was at my best, but Homer provided wonderful insights nevertheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homer Flynn has always been associated with The Residents as an owner of The Cryptic Corporation, but not much is publicly known about him. As soon as I saw &lt;a href=&quot;http://johanssonprojects.com/shows/homer_show.html&quot;&gt;photos from a public art gallery show of his work &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I knew I had to talk to him. To me, the art is just as much a part of The Residents as the music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weeks after some inquiries, I was able to get an interview set up, but Homer was so busy we postponed it for several months. The stars aligned and we were able to meet and chat on Wednesday, May 25, 2016 at 3PM in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interview-transcript&quot;&gt;Interview transcript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;Anthony: This is Anthony from MakeWeirdMusic.com and I am here with Homer Flynn. Homer, thank you so much for joining us. I really appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Homer: Sure. Hi, Anthony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Can you tell us who you are and what you do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: Yes. My name is Homer Flynn. I am one of the owners of &lt;a href=&quot;http://crypticorp.com&quot;&gt;the Cryptic Corporation &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The Cryptic Corporation is the managers, handlers, PR interface for The Residents. The Residents are an art, music, and performance collective in San Francisco since 1972.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: And how has the band–what’s unique about the band? There’s a movie called &lt;a href=&quot;http://residentsmovie.com/about/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theory of Obscurity&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and it’s primarily about The Residents and their history, but…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: Well, I suppose the most unique thing about The Residents is &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;they have chosen to present themselves as a sort of faceless façade.&lt;/span&gt; The group members have never been identified. They’ve never actually shown their faces. No one really knows if it’s the same people now that it was in 1972 and, as far as The Residents are concerned, that’s not quite important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: They have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.residents.com/home/page3/index.html&quot;&gt;quite a storied history &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; going from playing in a small shop to touring the world. Can you tell us about the evolution of their growth?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: Well, that’s a…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: It’s a big story. 40-some years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: Right. It’s a big question. Once again, they’ve been doing this since ‘72, so a lot of their evolution, I suppose–they started out sort of as the ultimate studio group. They didn’t tour. They didn’t perform live for the first 10 years. They were very influenced by people like &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/frank-zappa&quot;&gt;Frank Zappa&lt;/a&gt;, people who used the studio as a tool, as another instrument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Really, they came at it more from a point of view of non-musicians.&lt;/span&gt; They had an attitude that they learned to play something just well enough to get it recorded and then they would record it and never play it again, which is pretty much the opposite from a normal band where you get several people together, they all practice and practice until they get to the point where they can play a song, or a series of songs, well together. The Residents never did that. So, that kind of put them in their own space, more or less, from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;There was interest in them playing live, but they felt like their studio sound was so–once again, it was a very complex sound. It wasn’t complex because they were great musicians. It was because of the layering they would create with their recording techniques. It was such an interesting and unique sound they felt like people would be disappointed if they couldn’t re-create that live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/hBjs6nwzeSI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, for the first ten years, they didn’t play. All they did was record. And then, with the invention of samplers, at least on a broad level, the first thing being emulators back in the early 80s–at that point, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;they started feeling like maybe they &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; recreate their studio sound to some extent. That’s when they first started touring.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Another thing about The Residents is &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;they’ve always felt the visual side of their work was equal in many ways to the music side&lt;/span&gt; from the point of view of how &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; valued it. So, they were very early doing music videos. I’m the person who’s done a lot of their album covers, most of their album covers. I always felt that album covers were very important in terms of you giving some sort of signal as to what this project was all about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, once again, they started touring in the 80s, they did three tours in the 80s, they began to computerize in the early 90s when they first started doing MIDI. MIDI, of course, kind of took the real-time element out of music for them. And a lot of ways–you know, they &lt;em&gt;weren’t&lt;/em&gt; great musicians, so that just made things a little easier, or certainly more flexible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And then in the 90s, they were very involved in CD-ROMs. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Residents#1991.E2.80.9397:_Multimedia_projects&quot;&gt;They put out three CD-ROMs &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that were very well-accepted. There was so much working on that kind of material. [This is where Homer got a phone call and we had to cut.] So, anyway, in the 90s, The Residents virtually did not perform at all. They were involved in CD-ROM projects. That world kind of went away. And then they started touring again in the late 90s. And they’ve been touring fairly regularly ever since. Although, once again, things continue to change and evolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/oM20mw6PCh8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Their performance stuff–&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;The Residents really do performance art, they’re not really a band playing songs.&lt;/span&gt; So what they do really is very theatrical. But in some ways, as things come full circle or whatever, the kind of shows that they’re doing now are really more band-oriented. In some ways, the version of The Residents that exists now is called “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.residents.com/historical4/rcb/&quot;&gt;Randy, Chuck, and Bob &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.” Randy, Chuck, and Bob have been referred to as “the world’s greatest Residents cover band.” So, anyway, that’s a sort of capsule summary of 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: That’s wonderful. It’s interesting you had mentioned The Residents didn’t tour until they were able to replicate some of their sound live. However, now, these “covers” by Randy, Chuck, and Bob–these performances are &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; different from the original songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: Right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Was that a matter of maturity, growth, confidence? Or is it just a different era of the band?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: Yeah, honestly, I was say maturity, growth, confidence is probably hitting it pretty closely. You know, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;when they first started contemplating touring in the early 80s, they didn’t have any confidence in what they were doing.&lt;/span&gt; They really felt like–which is not to dismiss what they did at that time–but at the same time, they kind of felt like they needed a certain amount of smoke and mirrors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/B3sEgtM8oKI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;When they took their first show out, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mole_Show_Live_at_the_Roxy&quot;&gt;The Mole Show &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in ‘82, I think–they had 20 gigantic backdrops. The backdrops were 20 feet tall and 10 feet wide, I think. It took them, literally, 4-5 hours to set up just the backdrops before every show. That tour lost anywhere from 10-20,000 dollars depending on whose accounting you went by and you were lucky if you got any accounting at all from anybody. It was a complete and total disaster and ultimately, as their confidence and maturity has grown, they’ve become much more efficient about what they do. Ultimately, I think that efficiency pays off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: How about you as an artist? Your art has evolved quite a bit. Did you go through similar stages of development as you worked alongside The Residents? Were you going through something similar?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: Sure. I would say so. My own evolution–&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I try to do things a lot simpler now than what I used to. I used to feel like things needed to be very busy and complicated&lt;/span&gt;, but once again, that also has to do with the evolution and changes in the technology and the culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: The efficiency of the tools, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: And the efficiency of the tools, but it used to be that when you did a primary graphic for an album, it was an album cover. It was 12 inches by 12 inches. You had a lot of space there to fill up. Now, ultimately your primary graphic or marketing tool is something that’s gonna be maybe 2 inches by 2 inches and show up on iTunes. You better be pretty economical with that. So, once again, all these things have changed and evolved. If anything, what I’ve learned over the years is that you have to learn how to surf the changes. You can’t fight the changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Ah, interesting. So, speaking of which… The music industry has completely changed. The way people participate with music and art has completely changed. What are some of your thoughts on the way people do that now as opposed to, maybe in the 1970s when it seems that maybe there was an artistic prime in those kinds of industries and tech wasn’t invading everything?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: Well, I have mixed feelings about all that. I mean &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;in some ways I can understand what you’re saying and on the other hand I see how tech has opened the doors wider open than ever.&lt;/span&gt; At this point in time, anybody with a laptop, if not a phone, not only has musical instruments, but they have a studio right there. Ultimately, I could sit here at this table in this coffee shop and I could create a song on my phone. I could post it on &lt;a href=&quot;http://soundcloud.com&quot;&gt;SoundCloud &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and I could have something up and out for people to consume within an hour, were I so inclined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: No record companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: I think that’s great. On the other hand, by the same token, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;there’s a massive amount of garbage out there. If you are a consumer weeding your way through all of that garbage, it can be pretty daunting.&lt;/span&gt; It used to be, when I was young I’d go to a record store. You’d thumb through some albums. If a cover caught your fancy, maybe someone would play a little bit of it for you… Once again, the choices were a lot simpler, the times were a lot simpler. But, again, you surf the changes. You don’t fight the changes. I try to find what I feel is the good part of the way things have changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: As you’re looking around the music industry and art today–like you said, there’s a lot of garbage–are there any &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; artists that you admire, whether in visual graphic design or in music? Anyone that you’re looking at, thinking “they’re doing it differently” like The Residents are doing it differently?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: Well, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;it’s hard to find anybody that I can compare to The Residents.&lt;/span&gt; I mean, The Residents are still pretty unique even though, in a lot of ways, The Residents are not as “out” at this point as what they were in the mid-70s. There is no basis of comparison. There was no basis of comparison at that point. You can actually compare The Residents to some extent now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/0pdDkql6VYE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But, I certainly seek out new music and find stuff that I’ll like. There’s a Finnish group called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alamaailman_Vasarat&quot;&gt;Alamaailman Vasarat &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I’m an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMusic&quot;&gt;eMusic subscriber &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and so with eMusic, I pay $14/month subscription and you download. It’s like a use-it-or-lose-it deal. So, if you don’t do it, you don’t get ‘em and that forces me to download new music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So this group–I think it was just something that was recommended to me on eMusic. It’s a fairly large group, 7 or 8 pieces. Maybe 9 pieces, with horns. They were kind of lumped in with Eastern European music. They are kind of almost like a punk jazz fusion that I find very unique and very compelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Something else that I just downloaded from eMusic… Sometimes my deadline is coming so I get desperate. I have to download something. So, I discovered these Russian a capalla recordings. They must have 20 albums out. It’s called something dumb like “Free ‘n Easy” or “Sweet ‘n Jazzy” or something like that, but they had one entire album of Michael Jackson covers and they had this great version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Jean&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Billie Jean&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that I just popped up on my iTunes yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, anyway, the point is I still think there’s a lot of interesting music being created because the tools are so fantasti, but at the same time, you have to work hard to find it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/NRweyGHJ3bc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Right. So, The Residents in their early stages seemed to be pretty rebellious, maybe even politically motivated in some senses with Third Reich and Roll, there’s controversy there. Not, it seems to be more thematically weird. Their music has evolved over time. Obviously not running out of things to say, but like you said, they were incomparable at the time and now they’re more comparable to music. Is that because the rest of the groups out there have caught up?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I think the culture has caught up to The Residents to some extent.&lt;/span&gt; I do because, you know, The Residents are… older at this point. There’s kind of two things there. It’s kind of hard to keep charging again like you’re in your early 20s or 30s, and at the same time, I don’t think they feel it’s necessary to do that as much now as they did then. So, I think you have both of those things working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: A lot of the themes, lyrics, and music are fairly dark for The Residents. I’d say there’s a lot of dark music in their catalogue. Is there something motivating that? Is it just fun and weird for them? How do they think of a story about a deranged clown like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweedles&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tweedles&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Lover&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Lover&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;? Where do these themes come from and how do they motivate the music?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: You’re correct that those things–there’s a certain dark aspect to those. From my own perspective, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;they’re just sort of reflecting life as they see it. There’s also a lot of humor in those exact same things.&lt;/span&gt; They try to balance out the darkness with a certain amount of humor. People bring that up at times and usually when they do, I say, “How closely do you read the headlines on CNN?” From my point of view, The Residents aren’t nearly as dark as real life. If you wanna go out there and start–I just saw one yesterday that’s like a manhunt for a guy who murdered his 8-month-old son. The Residents would &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; go there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ob1hLi0UFP4?list=PL4yn92zU2slE2P4a9RKpZ9_PYoxJOekd4&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yeah, that’s pretty interesting. In terms of the musical evoluation and maturity of the group, can you tell us about how songs come together? How do these album concepts come together? I think you mentioned in a couple interviews something about train wrecks. How do these songs come together and what inspires some of these themes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: Honestly, it’s hard to know exactly where some of these things come from. They usually just kind of appear on their own. Some things appear in a fairly intact way. The train wreck thing–there is one of The Residents in particular that’s had this great fascination and love affair with trains. It was really another one that suggested doing something with trains knowing how much this one loved trains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;They thought it’d be interesting to do something about trains, but typically with The Residents… &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;What are you gonna do with just trains? You have to go somewhere with it&lt;/span&gt; and a lot of times these things pop up more or less intact. Other times they evolve with the creative process or with research, which can be kind of the same thing. With this one, “Okay… train wrecks. What can we do about train wrecks?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;What they found was a book for want of a better term. It’s really a Kindle download that is a collection of newspaper articles from the late 1800s to early 1900s. It’s called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Death-Train-Terrifying-Accidents-1879-1927-ebook/dp/B00JFL9OWA&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death by Train&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, it’s not &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; train wrecks. There’s a lot of train wrecks in it, but it’s also people that fall on the tracks. The train runs over them and they get cut in half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So they started reading this book and what they found that was particularly fascinating was the language of that era was so elegant and eloquent, but the events that they were describing were so completely horrific that the juxtaposition of the language against the events created a kind of interesting tension. In a lot of ways, that became–at least from the point of view of the text–became a lot of the inspiration for the lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But also, too, they also wanted to revisit from a form point of view, they had wanted to revisit something similar to their &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eskimo_(album)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eskimo&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; album. In a lot of ways ever since &lt;em&gt;Eskimo&lt;/em&gt;. So, the form of the &lt;em&gt;Train Wreck&lt;/em&gt; album is closer to &lt;em&gt;Eskimo&lt;/em&gt; probably than anything else they’ve done. It’s very multi-layered, it’s a collage of music, sound effects, singing, spoken word, textural stuff. So, anyway, those are the elements that sort of came together or are in the process of coming together to create that album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: And as a group that started out as not-great musicians, has the process of writing and assembling music become more enjoyable? More sophisticated? More fulfilling? Or, is music now secondary? As an artist, maybe you get an idea for graphics or something and you might propose that and maybe that inspires something?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: Sure, they’re always open to inspiration. So, yeah, if I were to do something graphically inspiring to them, they could take that and run with it for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Where do you see The Residents having impact on the world today? Obviously after several decades, they’re survivors. You said culturally you feel things are catching up to The Residents. Do you feel that The Residents have had a broad impact or has humanity changed and ideas have changed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Given the fact that 9 out of 10 people that you walk up to on the street will ask you, “The Residents? Who’s that?” It’s hard to feel like they’ve had a broad impact.&lt;/span&gt; I know they’ve had a significant impact on a smaller group of people, both in terms of other musicians and fans. We always said or discovered that, historically, a typical Residents fan was the weird freaky nerd that couldn’t relate to anybody in every little small town everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And I don’t know if that’s quite as true as it used to be, but &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I do think that for the people that have found The Residents and have felt alienated, disenfranchised… The Residents have opened a door for them.&lt;/span&gt; They said, “It’s okay to be weird and crazy and not be trying to imitate Beyonce or Jay-Z or whatever’s popular. You can follow your own path and that’s okay. That’s a good thing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[This next question legitimately makes no sense.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: And your sense as an artist, a graphic artist and somebody who uses technology–I feel like The Residents pushed a lot boundaries for many years and your art has always stood out. You can look at a video like Constantinople and go, “Nobody does art like that.” When you look at your artistic career, do you feel like there’s this still this consistent voice that is still unique and still will carry on and The Residents will still perpetuate that, people will be inspired by that? Or do you feel like it is its own thing for that little crowd and it’s special on its own like a gift to that small crowd?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/fcI5rNR5TGM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Well, personally I don’t see The Residents as having broad appeal.&lt;/span&gt; They’re never going to threaten Justin Bieber, but at the same time, I’ve always felt that to some extent that they were underexposed or underexploited and, you know the documentary, it’s gonna be interesting to see what kind of impact that has over time because, having been to quite a few screenings of that and spoken to various people about it, the response has been great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;There are an awful lot of people who, for one reason or another, happened upon a screening of it that don’t know much, if anything, about The Residents and they’ll talk about how inspired they were by it and how it makes them want to know more. Well, that’s a great thing. So, once again, it’s kinda hard to know what the future’s gonna bring, but I do think the influence and impact of The Residents will continue to grow over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/07/new-york-1percent-stifles-creative-talent&quot;&gt;an article &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Byrne&quot;&gt;David Byrne &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/03/leave-new-york-for-los-angeles&quot;&gt;another &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby&quot;&gt;Moby &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about the cost of living in artistic cities like New York and how there are cities like Florence and Venice that used to be flourishing with art, but now people just visit to take things away from it and not contribute to it. Do you feel, being a San Francisco-based artist, do you feel that’s happening here? Or do you see the art community is still flourishing, thriving, and doing well?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: Well, to be completely honest, I’ve never considered San Francisco to be much of an art center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Really? I’m from Phoenix, so compared to Phoenix…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/-am0-Oh6ypo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: I think LA is more of an art center than San Francisco. San Francisco is a great culinary center. It’s a great tech center. But, San Francisco, while I do know some great artists here, it does not particularly seem to embrace or cherish its artists. San Francisco looks towards New York or London or Paris. Why that is, I don’t know. &lt;a href=&quot;http://biblehub.com/luke/4-24.htm&quot;&gt;Jesus famously said &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “No man is a hero in his own hometown.” I think there’s some of that, for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I think in terms of supporting an artistic community here, I think it’s difficult in a lot of ways and I think, for young people, honestly there’s not much of a chance if you’re not part of the tech crowd making $150,000 a year or more, you can kind of forget it. Now, that doesn’t mean that you can’t find a place to live in Oakland or somewhere in the Bay Area, but it’s not very easy in San Francisco at this point. It’s like Manhattan and Brooklyn or something. Young people don’t go into Manhattan and get an apartment, but there are plenty of places in Brooklyn and a lot of young people are there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: The Residents, I think it was the 40th anniversary tour, they did the Wonder of Weird. What is it about “weird?” It’s in the title of my website, but for me it’s like “a unique voice.” What is it about The Residents that they’re embracing “weird?” What does it mean to them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: Honestly, my point of view is that &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;they’re not afraid to be themselves and afraid to be original. You can label that weird or not. That’s kind of irrelevant.&lt;/span&gt; I think most people don’t either have the confidence or they’re not bold enough to listen to their own unique voice and act on that. I think there are a handful of people out there that can listen to their own unique voice and do something that’s popular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;If you listen to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_Wonder&quot;&gt;Stevie Wonder &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; back in the 70s, the guy was just a fountain of beautiful, catchy pop music. It’s what &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Wilson&quot;&gt;Brian Wilson &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was in the 60s and I don’t think they were &lt;em&gt;trying&lt;/em&gt; to be popular. They were just being their own unique voice. But, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;so many people are unempowered or afraid to really be unique and original when that’s inherent in everybody.&lt;/span&gt; You could say–if you want to call that weird, that’s okay, but to me it’s “normal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Do you feel that you have found your own unique voice? Did you struggle with that over the years or have you always just kind of been you and you’ve done what you’ve done?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: Yeah, for the most part for me I supposed that came fairly easily. I can’t necessarily say why. As a graphic artist, when I started out, I knew that I didn’t really have the chops to be able to–I was always a big MC Escher fan. If you look at some of Escher’s work and the elegance with which he would hand-cut this wood, I thought, “I could never do that in a million years.” But, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;on the other hand, I guess I had confidence that I could do something unique relative to me and who I am.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Can you tell me about that? Who are you and how does that come out in your art?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: It’s hard to say other than attempting to be true to myself. It’s hard to say how that comes out. I think sometimes it’s more successful than others, but I think that’s true of any artist. To me, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;the most important thing about any kind of creativity is to be open. I feel like creativity is the process of life passing through you so that if you are truly and genuinely open to life, you open up, life comes in, it passes through you, and in the process of passing through, you stamp it or you flaw it or you beat it up and it comes out with whatever your unique sensibility is.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/MTJJb1UqjuA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: What do you feel are some of your works that reflect that unique sensibility most?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: I was always very proud of–you mentioned &lt;em&gt;Tweedles&lt;/em&gt; earlier and I thought that &lt;em&gt;Tweedles&lt;/em&gt; did a very good job of–at that time, I was working with 3-D graphics programs, particularly with a program called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poser&quot;&gt;Poser &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that was/is optimized for human figures and now, I guess the program is still around but I haven’t worked with it in a while. It was optimized for human figures and animal figures and the whole idea of the program is that the little wooden mannequins that artists have used for years to create poses, well this was the digital version of that and ultimately became very sophisticated, but the program was never hugely successful so it went from one company to another to another to another. And every time somebody would add something else and it got difficult to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Anyway, that was kind of the apex of my 3-D graphics short career and I felt very positive about that in terms of feeling like &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;it kinda captured where I was at at that time and I feel like that album was that.&lt;/span&gt; Also, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Third_Reich_%27n_Roll&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Third Reich ‘n Roll&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Eskimo&lt;/em&gt; were things that I felt like really captured where I was at and where The Residents were at at those moments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I look at those pieces and they’re as iconic as Andy Warhol’s Marilyn Monroe. I think they’re incredibly unique, there’s never been a piece that looked like these and I feel like &lt;em&gt;Eskimo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Third Reich&lt;/em&gt;, those two pieces stand out. So, for me, thinking about where you might have been at that point is interesting because you say you’ve developed over the years. You mentioned Tweedles, which is a recent thing, but there’s also some early work. It’s cool to hear an artist say, “I like stuff that I used to do &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; I like stuff I’ve done recently.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: Sure, to me it’s an ongoing process and I still feel like I have things to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Do you have more things to say? [Another idiotic question.] You have a wellspring in you and you’re highly motivated? Or do you feel like after 40 years of doing this, you’ve got a few ideas you want to get out and you’ll feel good after that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: I’m still pretty motivated. One of the more interesting things that’s happening right now is The Residents’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_in_Three_Persons&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;God in Three Persons&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from 1988 is in development as a stage piece and I’m pretty involved in that. I’m very excited about it. As time has moved on, they’re almost like parallel lines of The Residents. One, of course, is the new stuff that’s still being created, but the other is continuing to sort of mine the legacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Is it refreshing? That process? Is it satisfying to go back and sort of articulate certain things?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: For the most part it is. I’m not someone who enjoys rehashing the past in particular, but at the same time, for &lt;em&gt;God in Three Persons&lt;/em&gt;, The Residents always felt it was a stage piece waiting to happen and there were no resources or connections to make it happen up until the last, say, three or four years. So, the fact that there are new people wanting to get involved–a director, a producer–right now, this is set for a reading at ACT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;ACT is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Conservatory_Theater&quot;&gt;American Conservatory Theater &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the longtime, primary established theater group in San Francisco. So, there will be a reading of &lt;em&gt;God in Three Persons&lt;/em&gt; at ACT in September and the fact that there are, like I said, a lot of people involved in this and excited about it, that gets me excited too. That doesn’t feel like it’s rehashing the past. It feels like it’s giving new life to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Are The Residents bigger than ever? Do you feel like they have a bigger following than ever thanks to the internet, thanks to distribution that’s easy to access?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: I don’t know. If you look strictly from a sales point of view, I’d have to say, “Absolutely not.” But on the other hand, there are things that I think were more trendy at one time or another. And once again, when it comes to sales, nobody sells as much as they used to. You look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_(Michael_Jackson_album)&quot;&gt;Michael Jackson’s &lt;em&gt;Thriller&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, what’d it sell? 50 million copies? 65 or 70 million copies? I mean, something that sells &lt;em&gt;2&lt;/em&gt; million copies now is considered to be a big hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/fKipv2OAlcQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, once again, that has more to do with changes in the culture than it does with The Residents, really. I think in terms of their hardcore following, I think, “Sure, they’re as popular as ever.” The Residents just finished a tour. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Shadowland-Residents/dp/B00RZVBNYY&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shadowland&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the most recent show, they’ve done close to 55 performances of it. That’s pretty successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yeah, that’s incredible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: So, I suppose it just depends on what your measuring stick is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Well, it’s been super-enlightening. I’m really grateful for your time. And congratulations to you &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; The Residents. I think you are an incredible group of people. What you’re doing has had such an impact on me and so many other people. I love your art, I love the music that The Residents make. It’s just wonderful. Thank you for doing what you and the band do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: Well thank you. It’s always nice to hear those things. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Sometimes, you feel like you’re kind of isolated in your little studio somewhere. You’re staring at a computer and it’s like, “Is there actually a world out there?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: There is, man. There is a world. Casey is a big fan. He’s the guy behind the camera. I want to give him an opportunity if he has a question to ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;Casey: No, I think it was covered. Oh, one thing! &lt;em&gt;Tweedles&lt;/em&gt;. There was talk about it being a stage show like &lt;em&gt;God in Three Persons&lt;/em&gt;. Why was it never put on tour? Is it because the timing was bad? Because it does seem destined for a tour, I would think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: Yeah, it does seem like a timing issue. I’m trying to think what was happening… &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demons_Dance_Alone&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Demons Dance Alone&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was a big tour. I kinda of think maybe that was right before &lt;em&gt;Tweedles&lt;/em&gt;. And then I think &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bunny_Boy&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bunny Boy&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was right after. I think maybe &lt;em&gt;Bunny Boy&lt;/em&gt; just felt like a fresher project when it was time to tour. But, I think Tweedles could make a very interesting show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;C: So, there’s still talk of it being a stage show as opposed to a concert type of thing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: Yeah. Honestly, I think it lends itself more to a theater piece than it does to a concert. You know, watching audience reactions to things… Audience reaction to &lt;em&gt;Shadowland&lt;/em&gt; has been pretty fantastic and I think &lt;em&gt;Shadowland&lt;/em&gt; is a good show. I think it’s a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good show, but I think it’s almost a straight ahead rock show for The Residents as compared to &lt;em&gt;Demons Dance Alone&lt;/em&gt; or, heaven forbid, &lt;em&gt;The Mole Show&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/YAb_5RePyLc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, my sense is that audiences are–audiences have so much material to choose from that they almost need something a little pre-digested and categorized. The more you have a tendency to blur the lines of categories, the harder it is to sell it. I think that if you took something like &lt;em&gt;Tweedles&lt;/em&gt; and you said, “Okay, this is not a rock show, this is a theater piece.” &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;And you put it in theaters, I think audiences are going to be more accepting of it than if you tried to take it into rock clubs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;People are not going to have the attention span as they do for music. I feel like that was one of the things–the reaction to &lt;em&gt;Bunny Boy&lt;/em&gt; was very mixed because it was very theatrical whereas if you step back to &lt;em&gt;Demons Dance Alone&lt;/em&gt;, it was theatrical, but more purely musical. And I think that was a more successful tour, once again from an audience point of view, not necessarily my point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Thank you so much, Homer. I really appreciate it. It was great talking to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: Yeah, yeah! My pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Ben Levin Interview</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;special-thanks&quot;&gt;SPECIAL THANKS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://andyalt.com&quot;&gt;Andy Alt &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for connecting me and Ben. Andy is the mastermind behind the amazing guitar pickup, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alittlethunder.com&quot;&gt;A Little Thunder &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-context&quot;&gt;Some Context&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is our interview with the creative genius, Ben Levin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d never heard of Ben before Andy tagged me in a comment on a video Ben posted and suggested I interview Ben for the site. I was flattered that someone as busy and popular as Andy would think of me, but I was doubly impressed at Ben’s music video. It was visually creative, the music was very interesting, the lyrics were profound, and Ben was just a fun-looking dude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We soon started chatting on Facebook and I found that he’s the guitarist for a band I’d only briefly listened to called Bent Knee. &lt;a href=&quot;/interview/mike-keneally&quot;&gt;Mike Keneally&lt;/a&gt; had posted something on Twitter about “the incredible Bent Knee,” so I put Bent Knee in my private list of music I should someday get to hearing. Personally, I was more entranced by Ben’s solo music than I was with Bent Knee’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Ben sent me a full copy of his latest solo effort, &lt;em&gt;Life and Back&lt;/em&gt;, as well as a preview release of Bent Knee’s to-be-released album, [&lt;em&gt;Say So&lt;/em&gt;]. My mind was blown! At that point, I knew I had to prioritize Ben in the queue of people waiting for me to schedule interviews. So here we are!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.benlevingroup.com&quot;&gt;Don’t know who Ben is? Check out his website! &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This interview was conducted on Monday, April 11, 2016 at 9PM AZ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interview-transcript&quot;&gt;Interview transcript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;Anthony: This is Anthony from MakeWeirdMusic.com and I am here with Ben Levin. Unless it’s “Le-VIN…” Is it “LE-vin?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Ben: No, “LE-vin” is good. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: All right, cool. Ben Levin from &lt;a href=&quot;http://bentkneemusic.com&quot;&gt;Bent Knee &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Ben, I have been listening to your music in Bent Knee and your solo music. It’s pretty incredible stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I was wondering if you could introduce yourself. Tell us a little about yourself. Take as much time as you want and say as much as you feel is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: Okay. Hello, I am Ben Levin. I’m a musician. I make a lot of concept albums and really over-the-top music, but it’s always about little human things. I like telling stories with music and I like playing guitar. My favorite thing with music is making albums and writing then recording music. I think that’s the thing that is the most enjoyable aspect of life so far (outside of the love with humans thing, that’s pretty good too).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Let’s see… I am based in Boston and here I perform in a number of groups, mostly with the same people in those groups, but in different configurations. My pals who play in those groups and I have this collective called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.secretdogbrigade.com&quot;&gt;Secret Dog Brigade &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in which you find Bent Knee, &lt;a href=&quot;http://benlevingroup.com&quot;&gt;Ben Levin Group &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.secretdogbrigade.com/justice-cow/&quot;&gt;Justice Cow &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.secretdogbrigade.com/mr-gavins-meat-farm/&quot;&gt;Mr. Gavin’s Meat Farm &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.secretdogbrigade.com/that-one-eyed-kid/&quot;&gt;That One Eyed Kid &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, my solo stuff, and then &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.courtneyswain.com&quot;&gt;Courtney Swain &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (the singer from Bent Knee)’s solo stuff. And everyone else’s solo stuff as it comes up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I play in all those bands even though they’re mostly comprised of the same 8 or so people. It keeps me pretty busy and I teach music lessons on Skype. I have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/c/benlevin&quot;&gt;a YouTube channel &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and I make instructional videos as well as music videos. Private videos are just stupid running around and screaming. I’ve got about a dozen of those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Are those creatively done or are they more improvisational?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: Oh, that’s a good question. Well, they’re usually outtakes that I enjoy that I keep from when I’m trying to do something serious. Before I start filming an instructional video, when you’re making an instructional video or anything that you’re going to put on YouTube, I have no idea who I’m actually talking to and there’s so many ways to interpret a person, so I think &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;one of the safest ways to be inclusive when you’re making a video is to be happy just because, as long as you’re genuinely having fun, people can see that and at least they understand that you’re not resentful of the moment that you’re trying to bring them into&lt;/span&gt;. It’s more fun to be in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/7gwyVnft0OY&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, before I start recording, I’ll often be like HA-BLEE-DOO-LA-HOOGLAH-HEYGLUH-HOGLAH-HUNGAH! Or I’ll scream profanity or I’ll make up funny little phrases that are usually not too offensive, but it’s hard to think of one. They just kind of come. So, that gets caught on camera and then sometimes I think it’s funny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So it sets the mood?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: Yeah! And then I have a bunch of private videos that are old trailers for shows that I made when I was in college for concerts where I would be in college acting like a guy in college. Not that interesting to anyone except for my anymore. So, they’re there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Why so many bands at one time? What’s the purpose of having 8 separate groups with the same people?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: Well, that’s a great question. I know it’s kind of weird because it’s the same people. Everybody wants to be on our team, but everyone also wants to do their own thing. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;You can’t really sustainably hire people to play your music when you don’t make any money playing that music and you can’t have 8 bands succeed at once.&lt;/span&gt; Maybe someone could, but it seems like such a terrible gamble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, because there’s no way to get your music played by musicians and pay them, a better thing is to trade where it’s like I’ll play all of your songs, I’ll do whatever you want, and you play on my songs and you do whatever I want, and we’ll be in this band where we’ll collaborate, too. So everyone gets fulfilled in that way. Whoever’s got their own kind of path and music that they really want to try, gets a chance. And then, for Bent Knee in particular, it makes it so that when we’re in there, we’re much more easier to be democratic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;There’s a lot less conflict because we’ve all got some way of satisfying our own very nit-picky and control freak types of ideas.&lt;/span&gt; It creates a window for compromise. It’s sort of like an economy of creativity where I have the stuff I do absolutely by myself, it’s like life [inaudible]. I’ve done that a few times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Then I’ve got Ben Levin Group, which is music that I write, but ultimately I give an incredible amount of final say and power to everyone in the band, so it’s still pretty egocentric for me and pretty satisfying with “I can write the music and other people play it,” but there is a level of dependence, especially with the producer, Vince, who’s also in Bent Knee. He mixes all the Ben Levin Group stuff and produces it. It’s really a big, collaborative thing, even though it’s got my name on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And then Bent Knee is the ultimately democratic musical experience where everybody is equally involved in the music and the band is very familial in that way. There’s no leader. So, that’s the advantage of many bands with the same people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/9s7XwPw4Ie4&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: That’s great. How did you guys initially get together?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: We mostly met at &lt;a href=&quot;http://berklee.edu&quot;&gt;Berklee College of Music &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I’m in this band, That One-Eyed Kid, with someone I went to high school with. His name is Josh Friedman and he literally has one eye and that’s why the band’s called that. You’ll see him in a lot of my videos playing with me. I’ve been playing with him for a long time and then it made sense that when I went to college in Boston, I went to Berklee and he went to BU, and so we continued playing together and he’s been in Ben Levin Group since its second year. It formed in 2007 and he’s been in it since 2008 and we were in bands throughout high school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Everyone else I met through Berklee, pretty much. We all kind of started in Ben Levin Group to some capacity, like the violinist from Bent Knee, Chris and I met through Ben Levin Group. Courtney saw us at a Ben Levin Group show and then we started collaborating Bent Knee from that. Josh, the one-eyed kid guy, he’s in Ben Levin Group. Gavin, the drummer in Bent Knee, in Ben Levin Group. Just a lot of people. Everyone had something to do with the Ben Levin Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, that was sort of the beginning, but you can’t… Having the Ben Levin Group is like a composing studio group thing and it’s very important to me and it’s a very special space, but it’s very hard to do things by yourself or to always be in charge of everything. It was kind of against the grain for me to truly push that as far as it could because I wanted everyone to always–I wanted people to take on different jobs and help me manage the band and stuff, but I realized that can’t happen if it’s called Ben Levin Group and it’s just my music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I think it’s a maturity thing where you’re able to, at a certain age or a certain level of musical experience, be able to find just as much joy or maybe more in collaborating with others at an equal level than you do bossing them around.&lt;/span&gt; And the reason for that, I think, is when you’re in high school and you’re trying to be in a band with people and collaborate, you just fight all the time because everyone’s kind of an idiot. I’m not saying everyone in high school is an idiot, but you’re pretty bad at expressing yourself in a constructive way and being bold enough to say what you mean, but also sensitive enough to say in a constructive way and to take criticism–&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;collaborating in high school is incredibly hard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But then collaborating in college is only slightly easier. But then when you graduate from music school, a few years after you graduate, people start getting pretty good at music and pretty good at life, too. They start figuring out who they are for real and then you can start saying, “Hey, I have an idea for this, but this person always has great ideas and they might be better than mine and I actually want to hear them.” That’s why it took me so long to enter a fully collaborative project like Bent Knee and &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;it’s why Ben Levin Group was the first thing that happened because you’ve got a lot of hunger to make albums, but you don’t necessarily trust that everyone’s going to do a great job unless you tell them what to do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Right. &lt;a href=&quot;/interview/jeff-berlin&quot;&gt;I just interviewed Jeff Berlin&lt;/a&gt; a few weeks ago and he was talking a lot about music education and schools like Berklee. You ended up being a very creative person. Do you feel that your music education or the experience you had at Berklee ended up forming that or just educating it or opening/expanding horizons? All of the above? How did that experience help you as a musician?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: It helped me to be more creative and find my own voice because what happened was at Berklee, it’s sort of like an all-you-can-eat buffet of every kind of musical style, but there’s not enough time to really get 100% amazing authentic experience out of any one of them. So, unlike other music schools, where I think you can be completely focused on classical or jazz or one thing like that, and then become a true expert at that one field, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I think Berklee’s advantage is it gives people a chance to try everything and get pretty good at everything.&lt;/span&gt; There are people who get great at one thing there, too, but I think generally speaking, it’s a lot more of an experimental school to go to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;You try things out a lot. What that does is, because you’re surrounded by musicians and because you can try any kind of music you want at any time any semester, you get burned out on–well, not burned out, but you go through the process of trying and forming opinions about directions very quickly. So, I think it might have taken me maybe twice as long to discover that I even cared about bluegrass if I hadn’t gone to a place that provides bluegrass and metal because I wouldn’t have gotten my metal kick properly fed. I really wanted to learn some metal, that was there. I wanted to learn some jazz, that was there. I wanted to learn some bluegrass and that was there. I wanted to learn Middle Eastern music and that was there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/KBZRhlrPnTQ&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And so this whole phase of just figuring out what I like and trying things was accelerated that way and I don’t think it ever truly ends, but what happens is I think &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;when you’re in music school you make music that’s about learning music.&lt;/span&gt; So, I’m interested in this style and I want to make music in this style and so you try it. People do this all the time. It’s like, “Oh, I really like Michael Jackson, I want to make pop like he does.” So, you try to make a bluegrass song and, “What if I try to mix bluegrass with jazz?” Everyone does that! Mix this and mix that and mix this and mix that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And then you just sorta do it and then, for me, I didn’t want my music to be about learning music anymore because I got through that. Then music started being about more of a dialogue with the audience and with expressing things that are true in my life rather than making kind of meta-music about the things I’m learning inspired by the things I’m learning. I’m more inspired by life lessons and–I’ve got an album called &lt;a href=&quot;https://benlevingroup.bandcamp.com/album/pulse-of-a-nation&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pulse of a Nation&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is the first time that transition took place where I went from making albums about trying things out to now making albums about my life. That was about the first time I broke up with a serious girlfriend, my grandma died, and these are normal things that happen to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;You end a first relationship, you–and if everything goes according to plan, your grandparents die before you and your parents die before you and it’s a horrible thing. It’s really hard, but everyone goes through it and &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;that’s a really potent place to start writing music, even if it’s instrumental music&lt;/span&gt;, it can very clearly be about that and maybe people don’t understand that it is, but they can feel that it means a lot to you. And so I think Berklee helped me get to that point where I could start writing music that was about myself eloquently and also in a way that didn’t only make sense to myself because I had a really big vocabulary of styles, but I wasn’t also just obsessed with showcasing styles. I kind of had gone through that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Can you tell us a little about your influences? Who were the major musicians throughout your musical formation in your life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: Sure, yeah. I started out listening to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent_(musical)&quot;&gt;Rent the musical &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; over and over again on CD player when I was in elementary school. The original Broadway cast recording and I listened to the first disc for, like, a year every night. And I listened to the second disc after that. I listened to that obsessively and I really liked the way the melodies were and everything sounded really cool. I’d been playing piano at the time and so I was starting to be interested in music a little bit when I was in elementary school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But, then when I was in high school, I started getting into bands like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_(band)&quot;&gt;Nirvana &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weezer&quot;&gt;Weezer &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and these really emotional rock bands like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_a_Down&quot;&gt;System of a Down &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and stuff. That made me interested in guitar because I had a friend who was playing those songs on guitar and I was like, “Wait, how long have you been playing?” I was like, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;“You can play professional music after six months?! That’s crazy!!”&lt;/span&gt; He was like, “Yeah, whatever.” So then I wanted to play professional music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I wanted to play the music I listened to because on piano I never got good at any of those things I was trying because it just wasn’t the music I was listening to. I didn’t think I could do it. That was the other thing. But, it clicked in my head. It was like, “Oh, I can do this!” The Nirvana tunes and the Weezer tunes, they didn’t seem that hard and I started learning them. And so I was hugely influenced by grunge music and music about feeling pathetic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And then I got into metal, particularly &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megadeth&quot;&gt;Megadeth &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for a while because that was my first exposure to that kind of guitar playing, like with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marty_Friedman&quot;&gt;Marty Friedman &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; doing so many things. Such a versatile sound palette within just the narrow world of lead playing. They sound as full and rich as a human voice. Got into &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Led_Zeppelin&quot;&gt;Led Zeppelin &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for similar reasons. Then I started being obsessed with &lt;a href=&quot;/interview/steve-vai&quot;&gt;Steve Vai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Satriani&quot;&gt;Joe Satriani &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yngwie_Malmsteen&quot;&gt;Yngwie Malmsteen &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; because I saw the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G3:_Live_in_Denver&quot;&gt;G3 Live in Denver DVD &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and that’s when I started thinking I might want to do music for a living because I was so freaked out by Steve Vai in a great way that I learned everything I could about him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I found out he went to music school, he went to Berklee, which I hadn’t heard of, and then I was talking to my parents and I was like, “I think I want to go to music school. I could learn guitar in school.” And they were like, “Yeah, that’d be great.” And I was like, “Wait! So… college could be great! College could be really fun! Having a job could be guitar!” That was a lot from Steve Vai because &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Steve Vai, his life as far as his career goes, as far as the story of his career, is incredibly optimistic. It’s a really positive story.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I’m sure he’s had all kinds of hardship in his personal life, like everyone does, but his career arc is wonderful. It’s like, if you want to see if it’s possible, look at that guy. He went to music school, ends up in &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/frank-zappa&quot;&gt;Frank Zappa&lt;/a&gt;’s band, and then before you know it, he’s in all these big stadium gigs. But then, his greatest music is what got the most attention. He started a solo career that was really crazy and creative and that was like what I wanted to be doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I started making albums on my own in high school. I made four albums or five albums, four that I actually released and they were horrible. Total garbage.&lt;/span&gt; I did that all day every day when I wasn’t at school, so I don’t know if I got &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)&quot;&gt;10,000 hours &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from that, but that was enough time to make a lot of mistakes. I just made a lot of horrible music and then when I was in college, I made three or four, and since then I’ve made ten more. It’s my favorite thing to do! So, Steve Vai had a big role in that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And then, after college, I got really big into Sufjan Stevens and I got really big into &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Cave&quot;&gt;Nick Cave &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar&quot;&gt;Kendrick Lamar &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is my newest obsession. There’s the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tune-Yards&quot;&gt;Tune-Yards &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and I like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanza_Spalding&quot;&gt;Esperanza Spalding &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;’s new album a lot. You know, my thing shifted and I don’t listen to guitarists anymore, but that was a big thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I would say that Steve Vai had the most influence over my life up to the end of college and then &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufjan_Stevens&quot;&gt;Sufjan Stevens &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has had the most influence since then. I love the way he can make songs that are completely magical and enthralling and they’re about subjects I wouldn’t otherwise care about, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois_(Sufjan_Stevens_album)&quot;&gt;a whole album about the state of Illinois &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I’m from St. Louis, Missouri and Illinois never seemed that interesting and I never bothered to go there. Then he makes that whole state seem like a fascinating character, and it is. It’s a whole state. So much happens in a place and he shows the magic in that, which I think is incredible. And he did that for rodeos and he did that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_(album)&quot;&gt;for Michigan state &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and he did that for artists and he did that for, well it wasn’t that hard to do, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie_%26_Lowell&quot;&gt;this story of his relationship with his mom &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, he makes that very tangible. So, that’s kind of what I’m trying to do as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: One thing I found so interesting about your latest solo release is the looseness of time. It’s almost like the album is in a dream state where it’s like there are several drum patterns going on in slightly different tempos and you’re singing or rapping kind of in your own world, but it all comes together, it all falls apart, it all comes together. How did you get into that? Your musical influences up until you mentioned Kendrick Lamar and Sufjan Stevens are pretty straightforward music. They’re unique and interesting, but not so experimental in that sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: I think my process is whatever I’m listening to now in the time when I’m making the album. I just rip it right out and then I screw it up because I don’t have any experience with it and so the way that some hip hop is behind the beat, like particularly the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%27Angelo&quot;&gt;D’Angelo &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; record or any of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_Dilla&quot;&gt;J Dilla &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; disciples, and certain tracks on Kendrick’s album like that–Kendrick’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Pimp_a_Butterfly&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;To Pimp a Butterfly&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the greatest concept album I’ve ever heard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z-48u_uWMHY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I think it’s just the most amazingly executed album I’ve ever heard. It raised the bar on albums for me tremendously. It really flipped my life.&lt;/span&gt; And it’s only been about a year since I first heard it, but it &lt;em&gt;flipped&lt;/em&gt; my whole perspective on time and on what a concept album can do. It was one of the first hip hop albums that I &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt;. There are albums I think are really great, but this is an album that I can’t think of any album I love more than it and I think is necessary to use what you like about it in your own music. It’s necessary to have that love for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, the timing, the way they’re behind the beat is very nuanced. It’s the result of a lot of time playing, the music that came before the music they’re playing, there’s a lot of background and subtlety to how that “behind the beat” goes. But when you’re just now finding out about it and pointing at it like a straight line, like, “I’m gonna go behind the beat. NOW.” That creates a much more sort of caricature version of “behind the beat.” I think that by itself would be pretty stupid and pretty intangible, but I mixed it with all the stuff I know well from all the music I’ve already made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, there’s this certain cohesiveness I find. I’m pleased with it and I haven’t heard–not that many people have heard it in the first place–but I haven’t heard anyone complain about that. Actually, your coworker was pretty thrown off by it, but I think it eventually makes sense what it’s for because there’s microtonal melodies–&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtonal_music&quot;&gt;microtonal music &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is melodies where there’s notes between the notes and they use “out of tune-ness” in a standard definition of what “in tune” is and they bend that and, man, it sounds cool when you do it well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;The same is true in timing. You know how there’s only so many beats? [Beatboxes.] And then it’s like, [beatboxes]. And then it’s like [beatboxes]. And there’s [beatboxes]. These beats just keep popping up, but they always feel different when there’s different humans playing it. So, every human drummer has a different [beatboxes]. Every human drummer has a different one of those. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;So each time we hear a different human playing it, it is a different beat and for that reason, that inconsistency we get so much fresh energy from different songs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/DkM0Zlsmmg?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;That’s why the same chords can work over and over. It’s always going to be a different sound because it’s different people. So I was exploring that hard, microtonal beats thing. How far can you go out before it sounds “wrong?” I think whenever it went so far out that it sounded wrong, I’d try to make those moments very forcefully disturbing so that I’m using the “wrongness” and any time it felt like it was really in, I’d try to complement it with something beautiful. That’s how that went down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: A lot of software now on computers is very grid-oriented. It doesn’t leave a lot of room for those unknown territories. How do you assemble these kinds of rhythmic shifts and microtonal adjustments in whatever software you’re using when it’s not really a feature that Apple’s gonna build into Logic Pro or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: Yeah, well there’s some stuff that’s really mathematical. Mostly I play the beats in and that’s how I do it. I’m just not that good, so they’re sloppy. A tip for you musicians: If you make something sloppy and then you loop it in a quantized manner so the loop always starts perfectly on the 1, then it is not sloppy anymore. If you take the out of time thing and loop it perfectly, you feel that pulse, you feel that return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;So, you can play beats in for, like, 15 minutes and then listen to spots that really stand out, cut those and loop those spots.&lt;/span&gt; That’s a great start for some really organic, but in-time-out-of-time stuff. That’s something I do that’s pretty feel-oriented. I’ll just play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But then there’s also other tricks, like if you quantize to the quintuplet instead of the triplet or the eighth note and you don’t quantize at 100%, the notes don’t know where to go because you usually are playing or typing them on the triplets or on the 16th, so you’re evenly dividing things by 3s or by 4s or by 2s, but when you quantize to quintuplets, they sort of shift closer to the 5, which could be closer to the early 2 or the late 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;You can write in hi-hat parts and cymbal parts that are hard “out.” They’re &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; quantized to the quintuplet, but not all the way. They’re just not followable by themselves, but then you give a really on-time kick and snare, a perfectly executed kick and snare, and the next thing you have is a loose and dance-able groove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zUfoX275lOs?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I just think that some people learn music through analytical thought and some people need to jam it and need to hear it and some people need both. Everyone needs a little bit of both for sure, but some people are skewed for sure to the “I need to understand it from an analytical basis” and other people are more skewed to “I just need to absorb it from hearing it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;For me, I think, when I can think about something analytically, then I can actually make it organic because I’m not thinking while I’m doing it anymore. Once I understand the pattern, then I practice the pattern and then it’s no longer thoughtful and then I can skew the pattern in slight ways based on what’s happening around me. And other folks, if they learn the pattern, all they can do is remember the pattern, and think about the patterns inhibiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, I don’t know how a guy like Kendrick Lamar, or like some drummers I’ve played with who just have a really great instinct for the perfect “outness.” I don’t know exactly how they come to know that “outness.” Or if they think of it as “outness” as much as they think of it as how they like beats and that’s it. I know Kendrick Lamar’s a superb musician, so I imagine to some extent, even if it’s not how he does it, he’s probably able to analyze it to some extent. You know, When the snare and kick are really tight, but the bass is really lazy, then you’ve got an awesome thing there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I don’t know how much other musicians think about it as these formulas the way I do. I will say I’m not authentic with it in that I haven’t learned a lot of the grooves that these grooves are coming from in their original context. I’m just doing my own caricature impression of what I’ve heard from this album that changed my life, basically. Yeah, so, that’s how I was thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Guitar is your primary instrument. Correct?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: [Nods.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: There’s not much overt guitar on the album. Is that a constraint you set for yourself?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I think guitar is a widely overused instrument.&lt;/span&gt; I think there’s a pop culture and sexiness to it that was a big reason why so many people started using it and playing it. It’s a super versatile instrument, so if you’re going to play an instrument, that’s one of the best instruments to pick up. There’s lots of stuff to do as a beginner, there’s lots of cool stuff to learn, lots of resources. And then it’s a rabbit hole that goes forever, just like any other instrument, but the initial phase is really rewarding, unlike violin where the starting phase of learning violin is torture. It doesn’t even involve a violin. It’s just practicing bowing in the air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;The first phase of guitar is incredibly satisfying. You can play chords. I can show anyone, little kids, adults, anyone, to play 3 chords in a half hour lesson. They’re not hard to play. These are perfectly executed one-finger chords and they’re chords. There’s no way to say, “Well, that’s just a beginner chord.” It’s a chord. It’s totally legitimate and if you put it through distortion, 8-year-old boys have a life-changing moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Oxk9LGixbmM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Guitar is incredibly prominent as a social thing as a fun instrument to learn. And then everyone who starts a band has them. But, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I don’t think they’re treated equally with all the other instruments when people are writing for that reason.&lt;/span&gt; I think it’s skewed and I think it shows up just because they’re around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So then you have a lot of bands with two guitarists in it and there’s no reason why there’s two. The net result of there being two guitarists is that you can’t ever hear anything else. Just like there’s drummers who are always riding on the crash cymbal, which totally cuts out the vocals (if there are vocals)… It’s not like these people are consciously deciding to cut the vocals out, they’re just playing this instrument this way and they play it because they’re around and that’s what they’ve got.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I don’t think that’s a bad thing, but when I’m writing music, I’m thinking about instruments pretty democratically. The guitar shows up the amount I think that sound should show up. I’m definitely limited by the fact that I can’t just jump into the studio whenever I want and record a real string quartet or record a live drum and bass section any time I want, but I can do it pretty often because out here in Boston, I know musicians who I can do things for them and they can do things for me and get that trading kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I know those musicians and also there’s a recording studio that’s a non-profit called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.therecordco.org&quot;&gt;The Record Co &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that we do a lot of our recording at where they give a rate that allows me to experiment. So I’m still limited in that I can’t do it all the time, but I’m not as limited as I think I would be in some other scenarios. I just kind of lucked out with Berklee, it was a really lucky thing for me. I was lucky that I could go. I was lucky that when I was there, I actually met the people who I’m playing with now and that they stayed in Boston. And I’m lucky that the record company exists at all and that they are available to me. I’m lucky that everyone in my bands want to go spend a day in a recording studio even though they’ve got lots of work to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But, that was not your question, the question was about my limit of the guitar. But, rambling! That’s one of my strengths! I’m quite good at filling space. And you know what? Filling space, that’s another thing &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I’m really paranoid about filling space with the guitar. It takes up an incredible amount of range.&lt;/span&gt; It takes up a hefty amount of low end, and then an absurd amount of mid, and then if you’re going to mix piano and guitar and the guitarist is going blah blah blah blah blah, there’s gotta be a really compelling reason for those two instruments to be together in that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;There are lots of compelling reasons for that, but they just aren’t as common as, say, drums, bass, and one other thing. Drums and bass will be way more prominent in most of my music because I like beats. There’s more often than not a need for beats. There’s less often a need for a giant space-taking chord machine, which is guitar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Sounds like you think very texturally and sonically, not so much in terms of arrangements like, “Oh, I should have the guitar strumming here and I should have the bass doing this here.” It’s more like filling frequencies and painting kind of musical landscapes. Is that a good characterization?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: I think about arranging or voicing a chord. If you play a power chord on the guitar, it’s just two notes, but the way they are and the way they sound makes a huge sound, even if it’s a clean guitar. Even if it’s an acoustic guitar. The overtones are so deep and everything is so powerful with just those two notes. And most of the same lessons you get from that power chord you can apply to where the bass player is playing on his fretboard and where it lines up on the kick drum because one good thump on the kick drum with one good low F that’s sort of muted can be all the low end you need for the next two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But, similarly, if you take that same kick and line it up with a low F on an electric guitar, you’re in a totally different situation in terms of what else can be in the low end and you’ve still created that low thumpy F. And you can voice your whole arrangement like you would voice one chord on an instrument. So I think of it that way and I also think of it–because I’ve made a lot of crappy albums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I’ve made an astounding amount of crappy albums for my age because people are a lot more careful. I think they make better albums in terms of the number–usually people are too scared to make the investment to make a second crappy album after they’ve made the first one, so it’s usually people who hit a pretty good sound on their first one who make second ones. I mean, that’s not necessarily true, but &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I just get the feeling that people strike out less than me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/XXJryD1HMLA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I like everything since I made &lt;a href=&quot;https://benlevingroup.bandcamp.com/album/pulse-of-a-nation&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pulse of a Nation&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2009, but before that, stuff you can’t really find for the most part, some of it’s still there, but it’s pretty much garbage and a big part of the things I hear that are problems are just poor voicing of instruments. It’s just like, if you have four-part counterpart going on, you have four different things going on, I never really asked &lt;em&gt;why?&lt;/em&gt;. I just thought, “Wouldn’t it be neat to have four things happen at once?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I’m not saying you should question all those ideas, you should definitely try them. But once you do it, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;the reason why it’s there should be that it sounds good, not necessarily that you really wanted something with four parts in it.&lt;/span&gt; And that’s kinda where my mind went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I know Bach does it and I like Bach. He’s interesting. There’s this kind of, “I’m like Bach,” part of your brain that was more dominant before &lt;em&gt;Pulse of a Nation&lt;/em&gt; and then in my most recent work, I’m almost never thinking that way. I think that’s an evolutionary thing. I’ll look back to now and notice a lot of mistakes, but I just can’t notice them yet. I don’t know what mistakes I’m making, but I’m definitely making mistakes. I just can’t point to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s easy to point to, even in &lt;em&gt;Pulse of a Nation&lt;/em&gt; and beyond, these albums I like, I can still point to section by section and say how they could be better and change them. A lot of my music doesn’t sound good live from that time, but it works on a recording because you can cheat, you can double, and you can cut through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: It sounded like a lot of your time is spent teaching guitar lessons on Skype. Is that primarily how you make a living now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: Yeah, that’s basically all the money I’ve made since college. I’m hoping that Bent Knee makes money. I think if I were to spell out my ideal income structure, it would be: &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;make a lot of money from making music and then teach for free and teach sort of philanthropically&lt;/span&gt; where I would like to find people who definitely should go to Berklee or somewhere like that, would get a lot out of it, but can’t because the way things are right now–it’s like taking on more than $200,000 in student loans and then it’s really hard to take the kind of risks necessary to have a music career if you’re in that situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/xZBi-DNO36A?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s still possible, it can be done, I’ve seen it, but it’s unfair because you definitely get an amazing one-of-a-kind experience at Berklee, but I know if you could just get in a music community and have someone guide you through what Berklee &lt;em&gt;would have&lt;/em&gt; been like, if you got on mentor you pay once a week and you can get in with the community and it’s not the same thing as going there at all, but it’s a different way to get probably the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I know somebody who didn’t go to college at all who’s one of the people I play with all the time, he’s just as good and knowledgable as me and my Berklee pals. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;He’s self-taught. He was lucky he knew the right questions. He figured out what the right questions were and lots of questions and then he found people who could answer because they see his passion and they answer him.&lt;/span&gt; But, it looks like it’s going to be the other way around for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It looks like I’m going to be making a ton of music and, hopefully, continuing to grow in terms of how many people care about it. But, it could be a linear curve, or it could be an exponential curve. If it were a linear curve to my fan-reaching to how many people care over time, we’re talking at least another decade until that’s lucrative and then in that decade, there might not be an industry for just making your own albums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It might be people are making music for VR and they’re making it for video games and they’re making it for meditation and they’re making it for movies and they’re making it… tons of money making music, but I don’t know for sure that making your own albums will always be a source of income. Right now, even if it exists, you shouldn’t put all your chips in that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Touring is the alternative way to make money. If you’re an original band, you can do festivals and get paid a lot, so there’s money out there, but touring is not sustainable. Having gone on 16 tours that were all in a minivan and all sleeping on the ground and all that stuff, I imagine it’d be easier to tour for longer if you were in a nicer accommodation than what we do, but it is not a long-term sustainable income source if you want a family and if you want to be able to get sick and not have it ruin your career. Not have it bankrupt you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Now that’s not going to stop me from doing it, but I’m just saying that I shouldn’t expect that to be my–I should push that as hard as far as I can because of the music and then I should also anticipate other ways that I can turn that into money and I think one of them is: &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I want to be a famous musician because if I’m a famous musician, I can teach more people. I can reach people in large numbers. Colleges will give me a stage. I’ll be able to do clinics and you can make enough money that way. You can make a living. I think that’d be a beautiful way to do it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I think that for the original music I make is where, morally speaking, people should pay and then for education, we should all pass down the sacred art of music. But, I think that paying teachers is essential and I’m really glad people do pay for education in that the more education you can get online for free, the more people are realizing the value of one-on-one interaction and I’m getting all kinds of students who I think showed up on YouTube searching for lessons expecting to not pay for lessons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;They’re expecting to get everything from YouTube and they found something that really inspired them on my channel and then they want to actually study with me. I think that’s telling of how I’m giving so much for free and it’s my best effort at explaining things, but they still want to sign up, so I don’t think there’s going to be an end for people getting paid for teaching. I wouldn’t want there to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/BwdUAdc2VcE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But I’m just saying that if I could have things my way, I would just not have to worry about money with teaching and just do it maybe a little differently. I like my students, though. They’re the people who want to self educate, but ended up paying even though they can’t all afford it as often. They can’t do weekly lessons, some of them, and I really admire that hunger. You were going to get a free lesson and then you decided you got so much out of learning something that you wanted to pay and you weren’t even ever prepared to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I think that’s pretty amazing. I don’t know. I’m happy with things. I just want to make more money so I can do the other things that are important in life. I want a certain level of–I want to be able to help other people by not always needing to depend on my health being perfect and my stuff not being stolen. There’s emergencies and stuff that’s gonna be horrible, it’s gonna shatter things, I wanna have some money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I love your passion for all of these things. I think it’s really admirable and it’s wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: Same to you! I’m really impressed with what you’re doing. Your site looks beautiful and your stuff just comes across as like you really have a huge heart for it and it comes from this deep respect for music. It’s fun to hear and see it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Thanks a lot! That’s really nice of you! I really appreciate that. I have to say, and I think I emailed you about this, I was listening to your latest album and it was so personal that I had to stop listening to it. It was this crazy trip I was driving to Denver overnight, my wife was stuck in a blizzard on her way to the airport and the airport shut down and all this stuff, but on the way there on this 14-hour overnight drive from Phoenix, I was listening and some of the stuff you’re talking about is so personal and relatable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;I just recently delivered a presentation about Make Weird Music to a pretty large audience and I was so wracked by my nerves because it was so personal and I thought, “How did Ben release this music that’s so intimate and so deep and personal in a way that’s almost uncomfortable?” I really related to a lot of the things you were saying about the woman stuck in the infirmary, the old-people home, and the dignity of her humanity. Some of the lyrics in &lt;em&gt;Porn Sucks&lt;/em&gt;–it’s pretty funny, but also you’re like, “Wow, there’s some really insightful stuff.” Tell me about what it takes for you to go to that depth and really bare it all for the sake of music. Is that a struggle for you? Did you really have to overcome anything to get to that point?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: It’s cool. Thanks for asking me that. I’m really glad that the songs connected in that way. Those are really important issues to me. Especially ageism. It’s a word that doesn’t get thrown around that much. It’s sort of like fat jokes. People aren’t that sensitive to how fat people feel about fat jokes–not to get on you about the Suge Knight thing [referring to a joke I shared before we started filming], he’s kind of a dick–but I’m just saying particularly with elderly people. I mean, this is where we’re going. This is us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Elderly people–we &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; elderly people. If we assume everybody dies, then we’re already dead in that that’s like the majority of history as far as we know is going to be us dead.&lt;/span&gt; It’s this blip of life. Same is true about the elderly. I think it’s just really sad how they have to take a back seat on life in society. It’s also just really sad how aging looks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s very hard to cope with that reality. It’s very important to me. I think the reason why I write about things so bluntly and the reason why I’m able to do it is because I trust that if I do it in that kind of format, it’s the best chance I have at people seeing it as their own lens of it. Like, seeing it through their own lens rather than through mine because music just makes the human more relatable because &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I’m just a character in your stereo and you can only assume who I am. You’re really imposing yourself into your idea of me and for that reason, you can understand me better.&lt;/span&gt; You can empathize with what I’m saying. It’s the perfect medium for empathy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I don’t force enough details on you to make you see my story, I just give you enough for you to remember your story and then compare and contrast it to what I’ve given. I kind of feel like that’s my best way of being accepted in these confessions, or whatever they are. With anything that I feel that if I get it out clearly, if I can really say what I feel, other people probably feel that in some way in some part of their mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Like about the porn stuff, I think most people look at porn and I think within a demographic–I don’t know the stats of it–but I think that people look at porn a lot. I also think that when most people finish looking at porn, they don’t like it. I think once a man, particularly because I’m a man, I know how it feels once you ejaculate, you want to turn that thing off as fast as possible and it’s like, suddenly you’re just disgusted with it and it’s just this presence in your room that you’re ashamed of. You go to great discomfort to turn it off as fast as you can. And it’s not like you’re afraid you’re going to get caught of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s because the idea and the sight of it is appalling after you’re done and I think that’s a real telling sign and I think other people can relate to that feeling. I’m just kind of assuming that’s how other people feel when they’re in that position. I don’t know what is or what that’s doing. I have to explore it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I think a good way to explore a thing like that is to publicly describe it the best you can and then see what other people think.&lt;/span&gt; And so, you know, people disagree with me on that song and a lot of people agree. I’m still not completely sure what to make of the porn industry because I know there’s so much wrong with it, but people should have a right to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, I don’t really have my mind set on a lot of these things and I just want to–&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;questions and music go really well together.&lt;/span&gt; I think answers in music kind of–I can’t think of too many things I would want to write that are telling people the way things are. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Hip hop’s a good medium for telling people the way things are. That’s part of why I love &lt;em&gt;To Pimp a Butterfly&lt;/em&gt; is because every track on Kendrick’s album there kind of contradicts the previous one.&lt;/span&gt; He’ll tell you the way things are, but then he’ll tell you the opposite in the next track. I think that’s a much more human dialogue kind of feeling than an album–you know, it’s an album where I think you can empathize and see where he’s coming from better at the end of it whereas other albums I’ve heard about racism in America, things like that, social inequality, make me feel sort of alienated like I can never understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;This one didn’t make me feel like I can totally understand, but it made me feel like I can understand where Kendrick’s coming from a little better. It’s like one guy closer to being able to empathize with someone else. If an artist can–I think it’s just a great medium for contradictory statements and for questions and believing both sides and leaving things up in the air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/2B-Oe6bnDAE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I totally agree. There’s an album called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_the_Corner_to_the_Block&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Corner to the Block&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by the band &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic&quot;&gt;Galactic &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and every song has a different rapper. I always just liked the drum parts and there are some good hooks and stuff, but, literally, five years after I bought the album I started listening to the lyrics and I was like, “Oh my goodness! This stuff is profound!” As a guitar player, as a Steve Vai fan, as a Zappa fan, lyrics were always like, “Whatever. They kind of decorate the landscape.” But on this stuff, it’s so deep and so when I was listening to your album, which Andy Alt introduced me to you as some sort of guy who won a Steve Vai guitar competition and I heard your music and I’m like, “What does this guy have to do with Steve Vai?” Yeah, but the lyrics are such an opportunity that I don’t think I will ever breach, but I was very curious if there’s a struggle for you or if it’s just like, “No, this is my venue and this is how I do it and I’m much more comfortable doing this than having a conversation about it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: Yeah, I think it makes it easier to have a conversation about it when you know somebody’s heard the song because it’s harder to judge someone when they’re really opening up. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;We’re so afraid of being judged when we open up and become vulnerable but I think as the receiver of that opening up, past a certain age it’s really hard to punch that wound or see someone be that vulnerable and take advantage of it and push them.&lt;/span&gt; But people out there do that and it’s a risk certainly to open up like that, but it’s better to do it, I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Do your parents hear this music and go, “Wow Ben. I never expected this from you?” As a father myself, I’m like, “What if my kids released music like this?” You know? It’s pretty out there and it’s very–it makes a statement. It is not benign music and it’s jarring and disjointed at times in a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; way. I don’t mean that in a negative way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: Yeah yeah. I appreciate those adjectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: But like you said, you exploit the moments where things don’t work and it really does become an uncomfortable experience at times. And listening to the lyrics, it’s even more uncomfortable. Have people close to you, like your parents or a significant other or siblings or anything, had strong reactions to what you do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bjy4xUrHsHQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: Well, my parents are amazingly understanding. Not just understanding, but if I make something in a song, then they take it really seriously and so, I have an album called &lt;a href=&quot;https://benlevingroup.bandcamp.com/album/sea-stories&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sea Stories&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about a sex addict and he’s telling his story to his daughter and she ultimately accepts him for who he is. It’s kind of in the Nick Cave style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s really influenced by the Nick Cave album, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_the_Sky_Away&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Push the Sky Away&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He’s got albums like: “She was a light, I was a match, I was the light that could fire up her snatch.” Lines like that. But, he makes them work. I think that’s really amazing. In &lt;em&gt;Sea Stories&lt;/em&gt;, I have a song called &lt;em&gt;Constellations&lt;/em&gt; and the chorus is like, “Where does Orion keep his belt when he’s humping all those whores. If I was made in God’s image, does he have a thing for whores?” They’ve heard me do this for a while, these kinds of ultra-jarring lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I have an album called &lt;a href=&quot;https://benlevingroup.bandcamp.com/album/freak-machine&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Freak Machine&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and that was the first time I did that kind of thing. The whole thing is sung by Courtney, the girl from Bent Knee who sings. She sings, “My heart says no but my cock says yes” in the first song and she says it with all her might. My mom was like, “Can’t you say, ‘My heart says no but my &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt; says yes?’” That was the only time I think it ever came up that way, but they immediately, once they heard the finished thing, they understood why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/5t0ex229Pkk&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I think they love music too and they love books and they’re in the science and medicine field, so they’re not making music, but they love all that stuff and they understand that’s what part of music’s for. I don’t get crap from them, but this one music video I made for &lt;em&gt;Freak Machine&lt;/em&gt;, in the climax, my pal who stars in it shits out a rainbow and he gets smothered with a pillow that’s a monkey’s head. There’s a bunch of orgy stuff. There’s tons of blood. It’s really gruesome. It’s appropriately gruesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s the right video for that song, but I know a guy who went up to me one time and he was avoiding eye contact with me. I went up to him and I said, “Hi,” because I knew him and I liked him. He was really shy to talk to me and I figured out through the conversation after talking for a while that &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;he saw that video and didn’t understand the story behind it at all and just thought that I was this messed up kind of mean, evil person who would impose this on people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;That was weird because once I told him what it was about–it’s about a guy who shoots himself in the head and he experiences his greatest humiliations and realizes what he’s done as he’s going. It’s about a character so extreme that I hoped other people would be able to look at him and think, “Hey, at least I’m not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; messed up.” It was supposed to cheer some of my friends up who were really lonely. So when I explained the video like that, he was nice to me again and friendly again. That’s only happened that one time, really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Sometimes you give people your best and then they reject you.&lt;/span&gt; I think that’s just a necessary piece of taking much-needed risks. Like you talking in front of all those people and sharing what you’re doing and sharing your heart is really valuable because there’s probably a lot of people who want to know how you’re doing what you’re doing. You’ll give them the courage or the little boost they need to go and do what they want to do. And if people are doing what they want to do, that’s great! You can deny them all of your own greatness at their expense because of the few people who reject your best. Or even if it’s lots of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;One thing I always try to remind myself with making weird music is that if I make weird music, or music that is very specific and maybe not widely appealing but you have to have this certain set of interests to like it, the people who like it feel included in an often-exclusionary social world.&lt;/span&gt; If you’re the guy who gets beaten up in middle school, you hang out with the other guys who get beaten up and that makes it better. If you’re the only person who likes prog, then you go find prog hangouts and they get really close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;The prog community is really close. The metal community is really close. The hip hop community is really close. A lot of underground music scenes are really strong because people combine. So if you’re making super weird music, there’s this chance that you can reach these people who will really love it who, otherwise, no one is really making music for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;When I made &lt;a href=&quot;https://benlevingroup.bandcamp.com/album/life-and-back&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Life and Back&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, before I put it out, I didn’t think anyone would actually like it. It was the first time I ever thought that. I thought people were going to make fun of my rapping and they’re going to think it’s too far and people are going to react like they did with the &lt;em&gt;Freak Machine&lt;/em&gt; video and they’re going to give me crap. It’s actually been more well-received and talked about to me more than most of the things that I do besides Bent Knee. Bent Knee always gets lots of attention because it’s six people working all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I’m glad you picked it up and I have a chance to talk to anybody about it. When I put it out, though, I thought there might be some guy who’s day-to-day ritual is he sits at home and let’s say he’s got diabetes or something. That sucks. Or he has some condition that he can’t run outside and he’s alone, but the one thing he really likes to do is listen to music and this album can be one of the albums that really makes his day worth having.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;That’s always possible and you’d never know if that were the case because: what are the odds of the guy contacting you? Usually that doesn’t happen and you have no idea how many people are actually–maybe the number of views on YouTube or whatever, but &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;you don’t really know how many people in the world are really affected by what you’re doing on the internet. You don’t want to deny those people anything.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Oh yeah. One thing I love about your album is it’s easy to get lost in and I don’t understand it. I don’t mean thematically. I mean you just do so much stuff on there that makes me think about what I do as a musician and it’s so interesting. It’s so thought-provoking musically. It’s really cool to see someone tip-toe-ing to the edge, but it’s not something like several people I’ve talked to–Like Mattias Eklundh was just saying, “I want to be on the right side of weird.” I think you’re on the edge of the right side of weird. It’s not Rock in Opposition or Henry Cow or something like that, it’s its own music and it still fits within those bounds of “this is really creative and really interesting.” But it’s “outside” enough that makes me think it’s another world that I don’t understand and it’s probably part of the roots in hip hop and my exposure to hip hop is too limited, but there’s only so many hours and so many albums. But I can’t wait to check out some of the albums you’ve mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: I just say Kendrick Lamar’s &lt;em&gt;To Pimp a Butterfly&lt;/em&gt; and then &lt;em&gt;Case Closed&lt;/em&gt;. There’s obviously tons more amazing hip hop, but I just think that is the greatest expression of what I like about it and I want to use what I like. Hear where that all comes from for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Well, I thank you so much for your time. It’s really generous to give me so much of your time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: No problem. I appreciate it. It’s really fun for me and I’m glad that music matters to you. I’d love to be able to say that I can put out an album and I know for sure that a lot of people will care, but I never really know for sure. It’s nice when anyone cares. It’s especially nice when someone who cares so much about music cares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: That’s great, man. I can’t wait to talk to you and Bent Knee about the new album. I have so many thoughts and ideas about where you got influences. I could be totally off, but it’s what I hear when I listen to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: You’ll like them. They’re pretty silly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Thank you, Ben!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;B: Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PODCAST AUDIO COMING SOON!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interview-transcript&quot;&gt;Interview transcript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to Russell Muller, a long-time friend and big IA fan, for transcribing this interview. And I normally wouldn’t include the pre-interview content, but Mattias is so funny, I thought it was worth inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Mattias: Hello sir!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;Anthony: Hello, how are you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: I am good. I do live in the Swedish woods though and have crappy internet. You can’t see me, can you? No?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: No, no I can’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Oh, okay okay. If I turn on video, you can only see my ugly face and no sound I guess because we’re very far from… well we have broadband but it’s a mere joke. But it’s good to see you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Well, thank you! Alright, well then I don’t have to record video. I can just do audio. Or I can just put a big picture of you up on my screen. If you want, you can take some pictures of yourself and I can animate them into you talking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: That would be great. I can sort that out. I’ve tried video before and I think audio is tough enough. And I sit very close to the wireless router anyway, but it’s really insanely crappy. We are expecting fiber in a little while but there’s nothing now. It’s just pagan territory. We should be happy for audio. But I’ll make whatever. I can make a stupid animation as well, it’s cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: You know &lt;a href=&quot;/interview/jan-zehrfeld&quot;&gt;Jan Zehrfeld&lt;/a&gt;, he recorded himself with a camcorder and sent me the video files. So if you want to do that, that’s also an option. I don’t know if that’s easy for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/0ClQUP7wRw4?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Well I have all the stuff in my studio and I uh… But I’ll send you some stupid, I can even make an extra video, whatever. And say “uh hey, Make Weird Music promo, whatever” you know, in full tip-top HD. I’ll show my penis, whatever! Anything!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: We can get you, you know you can just move your mouth around and I can just use different shots of small clips of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Absolutely! I promise I’ll get you tons of, uh, I’ll make a dropbox folder and put lots of shit in there, I promise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Excellent!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Very good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Cool! Well, I don’t know if you’ve seen any of the other interviews that I’ve done, but they’re very low-key, very informal. They’re more in-depth conversations about you as a musician, how you write music, those kinds of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Yep, cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So yeah. It doesn’t have to be promotional. We don’t have to plug anything. People seem to just enjoy the casual nature of these conversations. So if that’s cool for you…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Absolutely. Super cool. Tip-top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Alright, great. Then I will just get started. I’ll introduce myself. My camera is over here, you can see me, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Okay so my camera is over here, and you’re on a screen over here. So I’m gonna look at the camera when I’m talking to you, but I won’t really see you… well I won’t see you in general so actually it makes it a lot easier. But I’ll just be looking back and forth occasionally. Hi, this is Anthony with MakeWeirdMusic.com and we have a special guest today with us all the way from Sweden: Mattias Eklundh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Hello! Hello!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Hello, how are you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: I am good. It’s freezing cold today; about -10 degrees Celsius which is, I don’t know Farennheit, it’s pretty cold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Pretty cold is what I think it means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Yes, yes. I have lots of facial hair and lots of hair on my pagan skull to protect me from the evil cold, but I like it. I like winter time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I hear you have quite a mane from the videos I’ve seen. Is it quite bigger now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Shave it off every evening, in the morning it’s back! It’s really strange. I don’t know! Yeah, I have lots of hair everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I’ve also heard someone on Facebook said that there’s a great translation of your name in another language, perhaps Hindi?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Yes, Hindi. Very much. Well the Swedish pronunciation is “ehk-lund” but in India–the first time I toured there for three and a half weeks, it took me 2 weeks to figure out why everybody looked really really strange when I told them my last name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;“What’s wrong, what’s up with you?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;“Don’t you know what ek-lahnd means in Hindi? Ek means ‘one,’ and lahnd is one ‘penis.’ So ‘one-penis’.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And it’s really stupid because, and I’ve said this many times, usually when you play an instrument and you’re gifted and you play that instrument, you are called that instrument. You are Mandolin Srinivas or Kanjeera Selvaganesh, or Bass Guitar Bob. But my name is “Guitar One-Dick” or “Guitar One Penis,” which is not bad. I mean, it could be &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerry_King&quot;&gt;Kerry King &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you know. So, Guitar One Penis! Yes, yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: [laughing] I don’t know if it’s because it’s super early for me or because that story is legitimately that funny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Yes, probably early. [laughing] Well you look good. Yes, oh God. That’s how it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/y-xVVVjdmqw?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So the purpose of the site is to introduce musicians and music enthusiasts to new musicians, new kinds of music. And you certainly do some unique stuff on the guitar, and just musically in terms of production and composition. So I thought it would be really cool if you could introduce yourself and talk about kind of the evolution of your career and what makes you unique as a musician.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Oh boy! That’s a tough one. Well, I am Swedish born, I am 46 years old, I live in the coutryside where nobody can hear you scream. And again everyone drinks diesel in their coffee and if they buy a new refrigerator they bring out the big tractor instead of recycling it and they just make a hole and stuff it in there… it’s got nothing to do with my music but anyway that’s where I live. I like it! The hillbillies, they’re okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But yeah, I’ve been doing this pretty much since I was a sperm and it’s, uh… I knew from the age of 6 that this is what I’m gonna do pretty much, you know? I started to play the drums, and I started to play drums on myself all the time and I drove everybody crazy. I have different parts of my body sound different. So I have a snare belly and, you know, a kick, whatever… breast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So it’s, uhm… this is what I do and I’ve been doing it for quite some time. And I’ve lived on it for I think 28 or 29 years, only my own strange music. And to me, that’s one thing to be able to do what you really want–complete freedom and have nobody else deciding for you. And that’s great. So basically a working day could be a cup of coffee, I take my son to school, take the German shepherds into the woods and, you know, wrack my brain a bit what to do with the day, and the wife makes breakfast and I light the fire. And then I take my strange mad scientist haircut and my strong coffee into the Applehorn studio and make strange music. And it’s a beautiful life. I adore it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And then eventually I travel the planet and spread the Viking diseases and so on. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;But the main thing is I knew that I was going to do when I was a little child, in my teenage years.&lt;/span&gt; I have 4 elder sisters and Mom and Dad tried to, of course, you know, raise them as decent human beings and everything. And of course they failed. And, uh, I was a mistake that fell out of my mom 8 years from my closest sister. And it’s like “Oh good God, it’s a male sex organ! It’s a boy!” So I was spoiled to death in many ways. You know, lots of love and attention, occasional Ace Frehley dolls and all kinds of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, the thing is, I put in second gear in my mid-teens and I realized that well, I’m going to do this! This is what I’m going to do! So I walked up to Mom and Dad, and we have something “gymnasium” I think… what is it, high school or, well, somewhere in between. And &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I said “I’m gonna quit school and I’m gonna spend 10 hours with my instrument every day. Is that okay?” And they said “Sure!”&lt;/span&gt; “What?! You’re okay with that?” So I hope I am going to be as liberal if my son finds something that he’s REALLY into. You know, “I want to collect stamps! 10 hours every day!” “Ah, yes, of course!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Probably makes more money than a musician.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Yeah, certainly! But again, I was a mistake. So it was like “Yeah, but you’ve been doing the same thing since you were 6 years old anyway so we can’t really stop you. It will backfire in a monumental kind of way. So yes, please do go ahead.” And so I’ve lived on this since, I was 16 at the time when I quit school and I’ve been living on it since I was 19 and only making my strange music. And of course, I’ve had my share of shitty years. But little by little I started to understand the business, how to make decent money from it and how to make the money return to you. Even if it’s really wacky stuff from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I also make slightly more commercial music with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freak_Kitchen&quot;&gt;Freak Kitchen &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, although it has a twist and we try to put various elements lurking. You know, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;it’s not obvious what’s happening but if you want to dig deep you can find south Indian reduction structures in a fairly commercial song or a nasty lyric.&lt;/span&gt; So that’s what I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/MWvFoIVoArA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I try as much as possible to grow my own moustache, as I say. I really want to, ah… &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;if I compose something, for instance, and I feel “this is a decent song” but it doesn’t have the smell of Mattias “IA” Eklundh from Sweden, it doesn’t have that typically “heathen” kind of smell, I really think long and hard to sort of dig out who I am and how to get that through in my music, and how to make it sound like ME.&lt;/span&gt; You know? So that’s what I’ve been doing quite a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Listening back to myself, when I was in my shredding teenage years I was, you know, flabbergasted when I heard &lt;a href=&quot;/interview/steve-vai&quot;&gt;Steve Vai&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yngwie_Malmsteen&quot;&gt;Yngwie Malmsteen &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_MacAlpine&quot;&gt;Tony MacAlpine &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or whatever you know. It’s like “I want to play like that.” And then I realized that, well I have to refine myself–my persona and my playing. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;So listening back I realize there is not a single original note here! All this is somebody else’s! You know, throw it out!&lt;/span&gt; You cannot play an interval that anyone else is doing. So I’ve been really focusing on trying to be me, for better or worse. Sometimes it’s like “Aw shit, this is me as well. But that was bad.” So, but that’s really how it is. That’s pretty much what I’ve been doing all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I had a 3-month kind of part-time job that was terrible. That’s it! Otherwise I provide my family a tip-top life in the Swedish woods where we live and have a good time! God, I talk a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: No, actually, it’s funny… Everyone I interview says that, but the point is to get you to talk a lot. So please talk as much as possible, that’s what people want to hear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Goodie goodie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So you’re a 19 year old, making a full-time living at that point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Yep!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: You were playing in a metal band I think at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Yeah. I moved to Copenhagen. I was desperate for some kind of action in my teenage life, and I had a band that was going nowhere at the time which was, you know, just my teenage band. But then I had an opportunity to audition for a Danish band called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fate_(band)&quot;&gt;Fate &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. When there was a band called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercyful_Fate&quot;&gt;Merciful Fate &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; featuring &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Diamond&quot;&gt;King Diamond &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with an upside-down cross on his forehead and everything, you know, blah blah blah. And when that split, one band became Fate, which was a pop band. You know, big hair, all that stuff. Kind of 80’s pop stuff. And then the other one became King Diamond which was, you know, satanic diabolical stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And I had an opportunity to… and I didn’t really like Fate the music they did, but they were signed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMI&quot;&gt;EMI &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, they were touring all over the place, and I thought “well, whatever!” As long as I get on with it! So I moved to Copenhagen, I got the gig. 25 other players had sort of auditioned. They played their over-produced demo cassettes, you know. And I thought that everything I had recorded up until that point was utter crap. So &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I brought my guitar instead and just went to the drummer’s place and played a lot in his living room. And they were just, you know “Eh! Tip-top! You got the gig!”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So I basically moved to Copenhagen and learned how to tour and the nasty side of show business. I got to puke in limousines and run naked in Munich, and drag innocent Swiss women up in their hotel room. You know, all kinds of stupid things that you had to do when you’re 19 or 20. And when I turned 21, I said “Well that’s it. I now understand what not to sign when it comes to a contract. I realize that this will make money, this will not make money.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It was a good learning period. And then I moved back to Sweden, and in ‘92 I …[founded]… Freak Kitchen. And that’s it. I’ve been building this strange, I dunno, mausoleum bit-by-bit, you know. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I could have made a thousand decisions along the way if I’d said yes to all the offers and this and that could make me a much, how should I say, you know, a bigger, more famous musician. But the thing is I am in quite good control of my music&lt;/span&gt;, and you can make, again, a nice living if you are, first of all if you adjust to new technology and you are aware of what’s going on, you know. And so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But also, if you [audio drops out] in an honest way and make good music just because you love it and, you know, play it like you mean it. People &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; listen to you. People will pick it up, although it’s a lot of white noise out there and everything is a blur, and there’s overkill. You know I’m a dinosaur. I’ve done this for a million years, you know. So thank God I didn’t start out today. That would have been tricky. I would have to show my penis, just to get some quick attention. I’ll do anything! You know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But yeah, I have a freak following. And they’re everywhere from Indonesia to America to, you know, I don’t know, to Brazil to Norway. And that’s great, because I’ve been doing it for such a long time. I usually say &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I’m like herpes. You know? I’m gone for a while, and then I come back, you know? That’s how it is. I never quite go away. You think you got rid of me? You did not. Dang!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Did growing up in Sweden, listening to primarily American instrumental rock music, was there an effect being in Sweden, being away from a lot of your influences geographically? And in a… I don’t know anything about the Swedish music scene or the music industry there. Could you describe what that was like for you and the kind of challenges or the ways it might have helped?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/_jbsn6VT8ks?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Yeah, I think it helped in many ways that first of all nobody lives in Sweden. We’re 9 million people in a pretty big European country. If you’ve seen it’s really wide stretched, you know. So there are some people who live in Gothenburg and some in Stockholm, which is the capital, but otherwise there’s nobody here. And that’s good. And it’s cold as heck, so you have to stay inside and practice on your &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibson_Flying_V&quot;&gt;Flying V &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And that’s what I did! I looked like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunchback_of_Notre-Dame&quot;&gt;Hunchback of Notre Dame &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; after 10 hours of sitting like that. But I think it was good. And it was really super duper when you managed to get a hold a Guitar Player with a flexi-disc, remember those?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Oh yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: With uh, say a &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/P3zR3htvIsQ&quot;&gt;Steve Vai demo of a Carvin amplifier &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. You know, and you had that little song &lt;em&gt;Blue Powder&lt;/em&gt;. And I would freak out, you know? There was a new &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/frank-zappa&quot;&gt;Frank Zappa&lt;/a&gt; album, I remember when &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_from_Hell&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jazz From Hell&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was released I was standing hours before the store actually opened, and so on…. So I think it really, really helped. There was no Internet, you know? People read magazines. So yeah, I think that being in Sweden helps and there’s lots of great Swedish bands you know, because &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;we practice, we take it quite seriously and there’s nothing else to do. Chop wood! Chop wood and play sweep picking!&lt;/span&gt; That’s it! Stupido, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: No, no, it’s perfectly fine. What are some of the other, um, like, do you know many musicians in Sweden? Do you know almost all of them as a result of being there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Yeah, well I know many. But as my son said the other day, he said, “Dad,” and he’s 8 years old and we were quiet in the car and I was taking him to school and he just looked at me and said “Dad, you don’t really have any friends. You only have fans.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And it’s like, “What do you mean? You’re my friend! And the band, and a few others.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;“Yeah, but they’re not really friends. That’s almost like family, you know? We don’t have any dinners with friends.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;“Yeah, well Dad is traveling a lot and when I’m home I want to be with you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;You know? And so on… So uh, but Sweden is small but I never go clubbing. I never, ever, you know people have to drag me to other bands’ gigs and so on. But we are very much aware of who we are and we know one another but I never hang out. Never ever, because when you travel like crazy, say you visit 28 countries in one year, well… the first thing you do when you want to come home is not to go and watch some live act. I hope I don’t sound arrogant, but I’d rather you know, light a fire, glass of white wine, blu-ray movie, whatever, you know? And then I charge my batteries, and then I travel the planet again and spread my strange music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/GvKFCGqdNeM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: How did you get hooked up with &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/panzerballett&quot;&gt;Panzerballett&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: It’s a good question. I think there was some freaky Zappa-esque kind of festival in Germany where I did a guitar clinic and they performed before. And I thought “What a band! What a band!” You know? Amazing, amazing guys. But I think that Jan Zehrfeld actually wrote me, I can’t remember, but I said when I hear the stuff I adore it. I think they’re really really cool. And um, but I also said that, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;“Hey, you’ve got to work on a few things. You’re just too good to have this anonymous kind of lame jazz-smelling artwork. You need to build something.”&lt;/span&gt; You know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;I met him at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musikmesse_Frankfurt&quot;&gt;Frankfurt Messe &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is, it used to be this big trade show and everything. And we had coffee and I said, “This and this you do right musically, you’re just top notch and insane, and I love you! But this and this is utter shit, you know? Nobody understands what it’s about. You have to have some kind of, if not image, at least some output. Pictures of the band! A logo! A cool record cover! A video! I’d be happy to help out.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Then a few records later we did this &lt;em&gt;Ikea Trauma&lt;/em&gt; kind of thing. Which is, well that’s my &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_Frehley&quot;&gt;Ace Frehley &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; doll! It’s featured in the video! And when my mom actually forgot me at &lt;a href=&quot;http://ikea.com&quot;&gt;Ikea &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and so therefore I don’t like Ikea. And I was a young man you know, and she was so into shopping, checked out and everything, and there I was alone. So, well, she figured out after a while that, “Hey, I’m missing little boy with penis. Where is he?” That’s a lot of penis talk now. I’ll shut up about this, sorry. So anyway, that’s it. I don’t remember how it actually started, but uh, I was invited to Jan’s wedding last year. I couldn’t go though, I was on tour though. But he’s a tip-top chap. A mad genius.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Absolutely. We spent probably 2 and a half hours together doing interviews for this website, and we’ve been emailing each other for quite some time. So I was quite pleased to be able to talk to him about this stuff. Tell me about how the impact of technology. You started 30 years ago or so, and things have changed over time. How has technology affected how you write music and how you recording it, and how you release it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Not super duper much. Of course when we started out it was all tape machines and everything, and now you have… I’m looking at my studio outside, it’s a different house in my garden, and I have goodie goodie equipment there and of course I record digitally. But the process is kind of the same anyway. But I bless today’s technology if used in the right way, so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Of course, you know, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I use the social media stuff as everybody else. But I try not to check it too much. I don’t want to live my life through it&lt;/span&gt;, I’m not going to post pictures of a family vacation in Greece, stuff like that, you know? But on the other hand it’s nice that I can sit in a hotel room after walking around in Kathmandu with my nice HD cam and so on, edit it, and throw it out on YouTube. That’s the beauty of it, you know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But you always have to have something to say. If you have something to say with your music or whatever, you know, then it’s great. But &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I feel today that a lot of people have lost their cool. They post for the sake of posting. They share the most lame stuff, you know?&lt;/span&gt; Stuff that takes away all the magic of following an artist. I don’t want to see your living room. I don’t want to know this stuff. I don’t want to see your bad morning haircut. You have beautiful hair this morning, you washed yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/86iUoBJJISc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: So stuff like that. You have to take it for what it is, as a wonderful tool. And it really is, you know? And I love editing video and making stupid stop-motion animation, and hey I’m gonna buy a new macro lens for my camera, whatever, and go really crazy and do strange LEGO animations and so on. Or put my son in front of the green screen, or my penis in front of the green screen. Sorry, there it went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And that’s great, that’s amazing. But writing a song, I sit with usually my acoustic guitar or my 8 string guitar and noodle around, and then I start working with it. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Even if I see the music in actual waveforms nowadays it’s still the same thing.&lt;/span&gt; Because you can cut and paste, you can edit like crazy but what I try to do as much as possible is learn something from start to finish. Of course you make mistakes, but the listener can tell if it’s all chopped up in a million punch-ins and so on. I like it a little dirty every once in a while, so yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: You sound a lot like Steve Vai and Frank Zappa in terms of maintaining control of your brand, your personal brand, and maintaining control of the business of your music. It sounds like you had kind of an awakening about 30 years ago in terms of the business. What does that look like? Is that a big part of your everyday life? Of is that just something that you’re very attuned to?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: You know my music is kind of out there in many ways. But I remember when I did &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freakkitchen.com/shop/product.php?id=50&quot;&gt;the first Freak Guitar album &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I have done 3 solo records with just guitar music, and nobody believed in it, and I didn’t believe in it. I was really happy to have it released in between two Freak Kitchen records, which is vocal-oriented and so on. It’s a band thing and it has much more commercial potential. And it sold like, it was insane, you know? Southeast Asia picked it up, everybody loved it, and it was recorded in a bathroom on 8 channels, you know? And it generated a lot of money because the money returned to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So I bought myself a house. My wife was smart enough to say, “Hey, this is the time in life where you actually invest in something.” And so on, and so I did. So what I do is, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I want to frame my life with good stuff. I want to have freedom. I don’t want to sit, spend my morning in a traffic jam and so on every day and be miserable.&lt;/span&gt; And so I try as much as possible to shape it up and make sure that I am not signing this piece of paper if I am not super duper aware of what it means in practice, you know. So that’s what I usually do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I spend my days turning things down, and saying “no, no, no, thank you, no, thank you, that was very kind but no.” Because I want to maintain control and I want to make money from my music&lt;/span&gt; because, again, it’s a small planet and I’ve been doing this forever. So people are aware of it. And if it doesn’t, if I’m not super happening in Taiwan, well maybe Turkey is cool then, or Tunisia, or Brazil, you know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So it’s always working somewhere. And there’s always a tour, or a gig, or a clinic, or a hoodie sold or a cap sold because I have a merchandise company as well and so on, you know with organic clothing. And sometimes it’s like “hey, do you want to write a guest column for some magazine, or do you want to do a guest lead here, or so on?” So money comes from different places, but the main thing is it returns to me and I have my own company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But I try to, you know, in order to be creative you should not have to worry about bills, and “oh I have to do this” and so on, you know? So I try as much as possible to be independent, to invest in things. For instance, just building my studio it took me 3 years because I was doing it from the ground and paying along the way from just playing, meanwhile keeping the family afloat and happy and providing food on the table, you know? So it took me 2 years and 7 months but then it was paid for, and it’s mine! You know? No mortgages or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/27561923&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/27561923&quot;&gt;Frank Zappa: Will That Be An Aisle Or A Window? (Cartoon)&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/carlkingdom&quot;&gt;Carl King&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com&quot;&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;And that is also freedom.&lt;/span&gt; You don’t cave in, or sort of drown in bills and monthly expenses, you know? And again it comes back to being creative and free to do whatever I want, because it’s life! Every day counts! That’s really how it is. So the business side is boring and I find it super duper boring to do bookkeeping and invoicing, but it has to be done. And I try to sort of work really super duper intense for an hour, and then really shut it off no matter where I am, and then make music for five hours. So it has to have a balance, you know? Otherwise you will just, again, drown in it you know, so yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: It sounds like there’s no shortage of opportunity for you. How did you go from… was it primarily the first record from Freak Kitchen that made you a big enough name to generate that much work where you’re turning things down on a regular basis? Or has this just been a natural evolution over the last 30 years? What has that been like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: I think it, again, about growing your own moustache.  For instance when I was joining Fate, the early, the Danish band, late ’89 when I was 19 and moved there, I immediately realized that is opportunity to show all my freaky teenage licks when we were doing a major company, you know, record release and everything. So I really grabbed the opportunity to show “this is what I can do!” Of course I overplayed and it was a complete guitar overkill. But the Japanese, they picked it up and they said “Oh this is great! This is a new guitar hero! Blah blah blah!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So when I quit the band I went straight to the Japanese and I said “Hey! You really liked what I did on this previous record? I’m gonna put a band together where I will sing and play. How would you like to cough up some money?” At the time, that was very possible. You could get, you know, $15,000 in advance and that would finance the entire recording, and maybe a support band tour, and everything, you know? Because I did some mistakes when I was 16 and 17. We signed some, you know, whatever, Chicken Brain Records for 94 records and so on, in a row. And you signed it in blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;And it took me forever to get rid of that. And I said “I don’t want to be the dumb musician, I want to actually be in control.”&lt;/span&gt; And in the early days of course I was starving like everybody else. It was really tough, you know. You didn’t have any money and you couldn’t pay any food. But I still kept on going. Instead of “Hey, I’ll play in a bar band.” You know, top 100 stuff. There’s nothing wrong with that, I don’t want to be arrogant. But it was not for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I spent weeks with my 4-track cassette kind of recording device and just recording new stuff all the time. And trying to, again, grow my own moustache. Dig myself up. I haven’t got a clue what the question was. But yes, thing are better and better looking back. It’s like, yeah, things are good. A lot of musicians, they complain their brains out all the time. “Oh, you can’t sell records.” No, but you can sell stuff on iTunes, and you can sell stuff here and there. “Oh, you can’t tour. Nobody will show up.” Well, you know if you… You have to adapt anyway. You cannot sit home and complain like “this is not at all like 1988!” You know? No it’s not! It’s a different time! But there’s money to be made, absolutely. And you’ve just got to go out there and grab it and find ways to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/bgs5M-n5okw?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Have you always had such a strong desire to be unique on your own, or did that come from influences?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: I think it came from influences. I haven’t really… Again, doing stuff for the sake of doing it, say well “I just want to be strange for the sake of being.” Well that’s easy. You can set yourself on fire and [garbled] off your ass and record it, whatever, and you will get some likes. And then the next day you will smell funny and nobody will ever [garbled] you again, you know? Or whatever, you know. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;People are desperate for quick attention. The hard thing is to do something in the long run and do something that’s worth while.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Quick attention, that’s social media. People do anything. “Hey, take your car and drive over me please. And record it so we can get some likes! Kill me now! Kill me now! I want some attention!” You know, you’re not bigger than your latest post, which is a crock of shit. Of course, people are cool, you know? Leave them alone for a while. I go crazy when, again all my colleagues, they post their brains out. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;There’s this ooze of desperation out there. You know? “Look at me! Look at me! Look at me!” Or you don’t exist.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Well, I exist. I certainly don’t want to post every day. I post when I have something to say, or “Hey, there’s a gig,” or “Hey, look at my new record, and here’s a video.” I don’t want to post “Oh, here’s me! I have snot in my nose on the way to the tour bus. Woo hoo! Likes anyone?” Who gives a shit, you know? And again, it takes away the cool stuff. It takes away the magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Again, you think about that stuff when you listen to the music. So it kind of makes the music sort of transparent as well, you know? Leave it. Sometimes it’s good to shut the fuck up. Said I, suffering from verbal diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Verbal Diarrhea is my favorite band, by the way. I just love them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: There is a band called Verbal Diarrhea? I didn’t even know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: No, I was joking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: [laughing] Okay, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Hey, so you’ve spoken a little about influences. You’ve mentioned a couple of names. Who are some of the musicians, or it were, that formed your musical identity and informed your sense of uniqueness and holding on to that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Well, uh, it started with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiss_(band)&quot;&gt;KISS &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. They had a major impact on my 6-7 year old Mattias Eklundh. Because it was blood and fire, and you know it was just big and amazing and dangerous. So that was great, I was really into KISS and I decided when &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destroyer_(Kiss_album)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Destroyer&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; came out, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alive!_(Kiss_album)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alive!&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; too, this is it! This is what I’m gonna do! But then Frank Zappa came along in ’81 and messed me up quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Because I said, “I like this as well. Why do I like quintuplets and fire and explosions? &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Can you combine quintuplets with blood spitting?” And said “Yeah, I think you can! And I will try to do that!”&lt;/span&gt; So I actually got to meet Frank when I was 11 years old and it was great. I don’t think I really got it, but it was really… it was doing something to me. Then I started to pick it up even more a few years later, buying some albums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Still liking KISS, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Maiden&quot;&gt;Iron Maiden &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judas_Priest&quot;&gt;Judas Priest &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And then my brother-in-law he showed me, “Hey, check this guy out. His name is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_Reinhardt&quot;&gt;Django Reinhardt &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and he played with two fingers.” And for me it was “Wow! What a hardcore thing! This is great!” It was, you know, old gypsy jazz but I thought he could shred like crazy. And it was amazing, you know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/rD36-Zn2bA4?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And then I discovered &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahavishnu_Orchestra&quot;&gt;Mahavishnu Orchestra &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and I love that. So I started to get into odd time and all that stuff. My mom has always been interested in Indian music and my dad would play train records. Just sounds of old trains. On LP! So there would be &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Peterson&quot;&gt;Oscar Petersen &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Shankar&quot;&gt;Ravi Shankar &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train_(band)&quot;&gt;Train &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sweet&quot;&gt;Sweet &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Cooper], KISS, Iron Maiden, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Davis&quot;&gt;Miles Davis &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Django Reinhardt, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slayer&quot;&gt;Slayer &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, all of it. So for me it’s pretty much good music or bad music. If you’ve got stuff to say, chances are quite good that I will like it if you play it like you mean it and so on. But of course Frank Zappa has been insanely influential on my Swedish self. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: What about song composition? When did you start writing music and how did it sound early on, and what has been the evolution of your songwriting?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Well, two of my really early hits… one was called &lt;em&gt;Homework Rots My Mind&lt;/em&gt;, and the other one was simply called &lt;em&gt;Go To Hell&lt;/em&gt;. We performed that when I was 9 or 10 years old, and my mom and dad had been to India and the uh… what the hell is that called? Incense do you call it? It smells a lot and some tiny smoke. We didn’t know what a smoke machine was, so we just duct taped together like a really big pack of incense in our classroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And I still have the recording of it. I played drums at that gig and after the first song you could hear some of my classmates saying “Could you get rid of the smoke? My eyes are running.” “Well we don’t have a smoke machine, so we need some smoke!” That classroom was never the same again. So yeah, you do what you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But I started to write songs very early on, 3-chord songs and 4-chord songs, and so on. Writing a song is always slippery. You never know really… a good song should be, I think you should be able to perform it on a banjo if that’s what it is. You know? I really don’t do a lot of growling. I’m still a lot into harmony. You can be aggressive, but then I like to actually hear what people are saying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I like a good scream every once in a while, but I still work a lot with harmony and tonality and rhythm, and stuff like that. Then it’s a matter of dressing it up and arranging it, and producing it. And it’s tricky, but I love it. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I love to make something out of nothing. That’s really the biggest kick.&lt;/span&gt; To walk into the studio with that strange cup of coffee and just “Oh, get behind the drumkit today? No, didn’t work? I’ll try the mandolin. No, it didn’t really generate any sparks.” Creative sparks, you know. Then I’ll sit with my 8 string and come up with something. And having a studio of your own is beautiful because of course you can just do something, right away. “Hey, I’ll do something today. I’ll write a song. I’ll record it. I’ll mix it! You know? And that’s great.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/wGo1Q4_F2LI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I’ve heard you talk about boredom being a great source of inspiration. Can you talk about that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Yeah. That’s Sweden for you. Sweden equals boredom. Nothing happens. Nobody is here. No, but I think it was somebody… there’s some video out there with a guy who shot, when I think I was asked during a clinic somewhere in Holland somebody asked “Do you have a special app that you practice to?” And I started to… there’s a slight fury inside there, because this is exactly what I do not like about today’s technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s because I make rock music. That’s really what it is. It’s a twisted version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC/DC&quot;&gt;AC/DC &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in a way, you know? And I plug in to my amplifier. I play very loud. I don’t like really racks of Line 6 stuff. I’m very very old school when it comes to that stuff. A lot of people think I have a lot of gear and effects. I do not. I plug straight into the amplifier and do everything with my passive volume pedal. No batteries or adapter. The rest are my fingers, you know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;What was the question again? I can’t remember… yes! Boredom! Boredom, boredom. Anyway, so I got this, “Do you have this practice routine, and have you heard about this app, and you can slow down, and you can do this, and…” And I just went crazy and said “There’s no bloody app for this! &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Spend 10 hours every day like me and give yourself the time, you know, and give yourself the opportunity to actually be good at something.&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Today everything is super fast, you know? Everything has to happen in a second, and if you’re not a top-notch player by the end of the week, you do something else! And everybody has a restless leg. I sit next to them in old planes, and just “Sit the f… still! Still! Be still! Breathe! Relax! Read a book! Spend an hour watching the clouds, you know?” But everything has to be “(gasp) Half way through the movie I’ll skip to another movie, or I’ll check the phone in the meanwhile. Oh, there’s no wifi on the plane? We’re fucked!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So again, long walks in the Swedish woods with the dogs really helps. You know, I need it. I really need it to block things out. I never bring my phone when visiting nature. And living in the countryside is good as well. I was much more confused when I was living in the city. Not everybody of course can live in the countryside, that’s how it is. But for me, it’s importanté really to clean my head and cleanse my brain. So boredom is important, you know. Allow yourself to be bored. It’s tricky, but it’s good for you, and it’s good for creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Are you a trained musician? Did you go to school ever in your career to study music or receive formal lessons in music theory, harmony?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Not at all! I’m a complete schmuck! I had a flute lesson when I was 10 and I hated it, and that’s it. I quit school, as I said before, when I was 16 and that’s it. And one day, one of my older sisters who, she was in big trouble years before that, but then she grew up and became a conductor. Which is obviously the way to do after sniffing super glue is to conduct an orchestra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/PJSRYXOHqsY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;She walked in to me and she asked me to play an F major 7 chord. She was into some Stevie Wonder song, I think &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Are_the_Sunshine_of_My_Life&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sunshine Of Your Life&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And I was shredding my brains out. I could sweep and swoop, and riff, and so on. But I didn’t know what an F major 7 chord was. And the most humiliating thing is when you are 15 – 16, and your older sister is moving your flying-V fingers around. You know, heavily distorted, and says “No no no, THIS is an F major 7.” No it’s like, FUCK YOU!!! So I just crawled away to the library and really just smashed all these books about musical theory and everything inside my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And really it was this eureka moment. It was really “I got it! I understand what is called a major 7, or a flat 7, or this is a Lydian scale. I can play the Lydian scale at warp speed, no problem! I just didn’t have a name. And if I don’t play the major 7, if I play a flat 7 and play the Lydian it’s called the Lydian dominant, also called the overtone scale, also used by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Béla_Bartók&quot;&gt;Bela Bartok &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” and so on…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And that was a really cool thing! And if I put this dot here, that means it’s an F sharp. Great! So I educated myself all the way, and now I have since 18 years… this is the 18th year I have my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freakguitar.com/fgc.html&quot;&gt;Freak Guitar Camp &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where I sit on my guru chair, which is a bit higher than everyone else’s for ego boosting, and also they can see my playing, and so yes. And we have 70 players from all over the world every year. And I started to take registrations for this summer last weekend, there are a few spots left, and then it’s sold out again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;You know, and I’m really grateful. But I write so much music. Really, practicing stuff. There’s a lot of, I have this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/freakguitartv&quot;&gt;FreakGuitarTV YouTube channel &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, there’s a lot of stuff called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGxpEubwDraVfVjbhSx7L65mmRrK1078e&quot;&gt;Growing Your Own Moustache &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that’s leftover kind of camp stuff. But this is also, of course, put down in notation and tablature. We explore Indian tonality and Japanese tonality, and all kinds of rhythms and reduction structures, and how to write a good song, and they get to meet a lot of people from all over the place, and lots of other guests and everything that I fly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/W2-R40yNY_I?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Jan Zehreld has been there. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guthrie_Govan&quot;&gt;Guthrie Govan &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_%22Bumblefoot%22_Thal&quot;&gt;Bumblefoot &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonas_Hellborg&quot;&gt;Jonas Hellborg &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and lots of Indians… it’s a tip-top thing, you know? And I’m honored to be able to do it. I cannot remember the question again, I’m just talking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: It was about being formally trained in any way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Yes, yes. No, I’ve educated myself. That’s the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Do you write out your music after you write it or as you’re writing it to remember the idea? Or is it you’re recording audio snippets here and there? How do you go about this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Usually it’s just recording. Walking into the studio or recording it on whatever, the cell phone or whatever, really quickly. Then I have a right hand, he’s a former camper, he’s so fast when it comes to music notation. So sometimes it’s like, “can you? This is a complicated tune and I’ll explain what I want to do… “ And he’s like, writing an email. He’s that fast. “Can you do this for me? I’ll give money. Just do it!” You know? So sometimes you have entire song transcriptions and everything, and sometimes I do it myself as well, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I’ve heard you use loops in some music, modified loops. I know that that’s played some kind of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnatic_music&quot;&gt;Carnatic rhythm &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; type stuff going on in your music, and I’ve also seen you completely destroy the use of other things and turning them into musical elements. So do you get a sense of melody and that drives a song? Or do you start with chords, or do you start with a sound? Or what do you seem to favor and how does that lead to a song?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: I think it’s different every time. Sometimes obviously it’s a hook, it’s a melody, it’s a riff… that has a melody, or it’s a cool riff from a cool rhythm. Sometimes it’s these unorthodox devices. You know, printers, and (clears throat) dildos, and combs, and hose clips, or whatever. But again, I find it very important not to, again, be weird for the sake of being weird, you know? &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;All the stuff I use, it may be a chopstick or whatever, is because you can only get that sound from a plastic chopstick. It’s not because “Hey! I want to be super-duper special! I want to use a chopstick today. Woo hoo!”&lt;/span&gt; or I walk around looking for things to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/RSRgkdoK19A?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s… almost everything is by mistake. And therefore I feel it’s much cooler, and I don’t know. You know, it works. The comb, for instance, I was alone in a Spanish hotel room and my luggage was somewhere else, no WiFi. 10 hours til sound check, and then you have this Air France survival kit, and everything, and I just started to comb the strings. And it was just, “This is great! I’ve never heard this before!” And so it has to have some kind of musical point. You know? Some kind of sound that you can only do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Same thing with the dildo. It was a sort of “Hey! Hey! Funny birthday gift!” And of course “Hey! It’s got a motor inside! I’ll try it on the guitar!” And it was woo-hoo! You know? I used to do it in a very overkill kind of way. I used to have like 10 or 15 dildos strapped onto my Swedish body and the guitar would come down from the light rig, and I would rub myself, and with the dildos going at different speeds, and the audience would love it. But it became too much because I threw them out. So nevermind! But you have to have some kind of point. That’s what it’s all about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: The life of a musician is very different in reality than people think from looking at magazines. Was that something that you realized early on, and does that impact you in the way that you look at yourself as a musician?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Well, for me it’s that the travel can be quite harsh. And again when you… I’ve been all around the planet, you know. There was one year, I think 2 or 3 years ago, I visited every bloody continent. It was insane. It was just too much. I remember the last trip before Christmas I was, ah, did some performance in Germany, then I went to Abu Dhabi, and then I went to Australia for a week. Moved every week, you know? Different stages every week.. And then I went to Indonesia, played Jarkarta, Bandung, then I went to China, then I went to Nepal, did Live In Kathmandu, back to Dubai, and then back to Europe. And this was in two and a half weeks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I was just dead meat. It took me a month to recover, you know? Different time zones every day. “Oh, we have to get up early, Mattias, to get the plane to Shanghai.” And so on, you know. It was madness. You sleep 3-4 hours a day, and you’re also supposed to be a superhero every time you walk on stage, you know? You do a 2 hour clinic or a beefy gig or whatever. And it’s tough. It’s really really tough. And people when you talk to them, “Oh great, so you’ve been to Australia! Did you see any kangaroos?” Yes, I did, from the cab to the hotel or from the air. So basically you spend your time in lobbies and airports, and you see that stuff that nobody wants to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/1iTWUyPq-3E?list=PLGxpEubwDraU9bABs-XUXA8KUAWGYox6_&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So I have no real illusions about being a professional musician. On the other hand, it’s a great job because you get to travel the planet. You know, I’m honored that people actually show up and that I can provide my family a groovy life with doing just what I’m doing. So that’s great, but boy it’s tough. We just did a 4 gig Italian tour in November. And planning was great, logistics were fine and everything, everything was tip-top, it was an early flight from Gothenburg. But of course Lufthansa, which was the airline company, they were on a strike. So they said, “Oh there is no way we’re gonna get you to Milan in time.” And we met like 4 in the morning, and it was going to be a cool day with lots of sleep and catching up and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It didn’t happen, of course. We got stuck in Dusseldorf and our backdrop was stolen, we barely reached the gig, and then for the next days we travelled like crazy. We’re 10 hours a day in the bus and no sleep whatsoever, you know. And then in Rome, while we were on stage in Rome, all the shit in Paris happened. You know, with the shootings and this terrible thing. And all of a sudden military came running and it was just madness all over the place. So you say to someone “Ah, we played Rome last Friday.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;“Oh great. Did you have an espresso macchiato? Take some time off? Did you watch the Coloseum?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;“Not really, no. I was sitting in a freezing backstage room while,” you know… So that’s how it is. Still, I don’t want to complain because this is what I choose to do and it’s great. But again I’m 46 and I’ve done it for such a long time. So we don’t want to do crappy things. It’s not super charming to always have a lack of sleep. And you age too fast in a way, you know. Overnight you get a really gray beard and “Oh good God, I look like a saddlebag. My face…” You know, some leather eyes, yes. But that’s okay,.. dead fish eyes. So it’s still okay, you know. I have seen more than people will do in a lifetime, I’ve seen in a year. From walking around in Calcutta or, hey! Live in Johannesburg, so I don’t want to change it, but it’s tough, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: You play guitar, you are a producer of bands, perhaps you even rent out your studio for people to record and you might help with engineering. How has your career expanded and evolved, and what does that look like for the future and the next 10 years for you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: I actually don’t rent my studio out because I built it like a 2 floor big playing ground, really. So there’s no walls to separate the drums. It’s just big, open space. And I love that to just be able to crawl over to the drums and so on. But yes, it’s a good questions because again I don’t want to tour to death. When people say “Can you come for 3 months to the states and tour?” “Haha! Are you kidding? 3 months away from the Swedish woods? Nope! We can come for two and a half weeks, that’s it. And you’ve got to pay us as well.” You know, so that’s really what it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So we do want to tour, but we’re all parents and we’re all middle-aged men. And in order to do good, you have to… Because I see a lot of miserable musician friends. They tour their brains out and all the money they earn, or even merchandise, it goes straight to some, I dunno, strange management account or whatever, and they return after 3 months on the road with no money. It’s not okay! They’ve been busting their asses, you know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So um, but the thing is, we’re gonna launch this next month. It’s called No Bull Stuff or No B.S. Organic Clothing featuring the Freak Kitchen cow. I just today I have, damn I wish you could see, a beautiful hood we have again eco-clothing in India that we’re making because I have a connection with India. So that’s really cool. And it’s me and a friend who used to make the Freak Kitchen merchandise, so that’s a cool business and our wives will be involved as well, picking, you know, packing stuff and shipping it. So that’s great, and also doing something good for the planet because the clothing industry is, of course, complete caca as they say in France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/y2vzBdIejVY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So that’s cool, and I’ve also, last year we did this lovely video called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2vzBdIejVY&quot;&gt;Freak Of The Week with Juanjo Guarnido &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and a team from Disney and a lovely Parisian studio as well. And we’re in 2014, there was a book about it. And this opened up the world of animation for me. I adore of course watching Disney and Pixar with my family, and all of a sudden a relative from very far away, called Ben Rush, called me one day and said “Hey, I’m working at Dreamworks and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juanjo_Guarnido&quot;&gt;Juanjo Guarnido &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was here and showed your Freak Of The Week video, and I realized hey! That’s my distant cousin! We met when we were kids in Sweden!” And it’s like “Holy shit! I want to work together!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And now we’ve begun, we’re gonna start this IndieGoGo campaign of financing his first movie on his own. He’s now with Pixar but he wants to make this indie film called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/OnlyADreamMovie/&quot;&gt;Only A Dream &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m writing music for it. And that’s great as well. I’d love to take a year off and just write music for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/iUSPjWAlWxY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But I’ve also begun doing stop-motion. I love stop-motion. It’s insane just doing these animations. And the other day there was this company, it was a friend of mine, a Freak Guitar Camper, but he has this company said “We would like five sort of, I don’t know, stir around a bit kind of videos because we want to put it on social media and create some attention. Can you make some?” Because I did a few short, I call it minimalist animation kind of videos. And it’s “I love this! Can you make 5 for me?” And he paid a lot of money and it was great! And it’s like “Sure! I’d love to! Just to see what I can do.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So there I was, 25 frames or 24 in America per second, moving stuff around, and it turned out great. I loved it. And it’s lovely to sit down, because it’s so time consuming, in complete quiet. You know, and you do the most weird things with your body when you do stop-motion because you cannot screw it up. And I love that as well, and then I make music for it and that’s the beauty of today’s technology as well. And you throw it up on YouTube in full HD, 1080p. So yeah, it’s great. God I’m talking a lot. I’m sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/z4Zyk9g-MiU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: No, please don’t apologize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Alright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: The site is called Make Weird Music. You’ve talked about that you do KISS and Frank Zappa music kind of with a twist. Could you describe the twist for us and what that means to you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: I’ve always, again as I said, been trying to grow my own moustache. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;But I always want to sort of stay on the right side of weird&lt;/span&gt;, you know what I mean? I don’t want to alienate people. I don’t want to put people away. Obviously I want people to hear my stuff. But I also want to include things that you normally don’t do. Not for the sake of doing it, just because I’m interested in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1JRHkp7D4E?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;If I travel to India, for instance, and I spend time in Chennai with just kids clapping hands. Listening to their, sort of, Carnatic rhythm structures it freaks me out! I said “Jesus Christ! I didn’t know this! This is excellent!” They could be 8 year old kids and they kick my ass so bad. They don’t give a shit if I know &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dweezil_Zappa&quot;&gt;Dweezil Zappa &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or I hang out with the guys in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meshuggah&quot;&gt;Meshuggah &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. They don’t care, you know? And I’m amazed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And I bring it back to Sweden and I try to incorporate it, again without making it so ‘out there’ that nobody would listen to it. It has to have a groove. I always go back before production and listen to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_There_Be_Rock_(song)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let There Be Rock&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with AC/DC and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-Nite_Sensation&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Over-Nite Sensation&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with Frank Zappa. And sometimes a little bit of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Petty&quot;&gt;Tom Petty &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, say &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Into_the_Great_Wide_Open&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Into The Great Wide Open&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, just good pop record. And say, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;“Why are these records so good? And how can I try to keep my cool and make good songs, but also incorporate all the elements that I’m interested in?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Because Freak Kitchen is not like, say Panzerballett. They are wonderful, but they are insane. They’re just insane. I laugh my ass off every time. We don’t want to do that. We have a different audience, in a way. You know, we want people to… we have kids and girls and boys and whatever, you know. We can play a death metal festival, or we can plan an indie Brit pop kind of festival, and we still work. We don’t want to be too ‘out there’ because it has to be still a good song.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And of course Panzerballett, you know they make excellent music, you know what I mean. But Jan is really exploring the depths of madness and so on. But &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I always go back to this “Why is this Tom Petty song so good? I like this. I want this melody. I want something like this&lt;/span&gt;, but I also want to have an Indian reduction structure attached to it or a quintuplet.” So that’s what I do. But I never sit down and think about it in a kind of intentional kind of way. “Today I’m gonna write a song in 9/8 and then I’m going to use this raga.” I do not! I just sit in front of the fireplace with my acoustic guitar. You have a lovely acoustic guitar behind your head. And write music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Oh I do, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Yes you do! And that’s how it is. It has to come natural, otherwise the song will be paper thin, you know? So yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: That’s wonderful. I love that description. Because I don’t want to convey the wrong side of weird. As much as I love &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cow&quot;&gt;Henry Cow &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I’d love to make music that my wife doesn’t hate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Yeah, true! Exactly. And the kids, they love it. The ultimate test is when you play stuff for 8 year old kids. Do they like it? If they like it, it’s good. You know, that’s really how it is. Do they get off on it in a way? So yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: That’s awesome. Thank you so much for your time. I really appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Thank you! Thank you! It’s been amazing. I’ll send you strange photo photo, and strange videos and all kinds of things. How does this work? Are you gonna put it live out there? Are you gonna transcribe? Or how are you gonna do it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I transcribe every interview. I have video tracks for everyone. I edit the video, I put in quote highlights. So yeah, and I do custom art so if there’s a photo you’d like me to turn into a cartoon of you I can do that as well. But otherwise I’ll just find something and you can look at some of the other interviews on the site and see what I’ve done. You might get something out of it. We’ll see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Very good. Well thanks a bunch. It was a pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Oh it’s my pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Let me know when it’s out there, and I will spread it like herpes we talked about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yeah, I really could use that.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Ignite Phoenix MWM Presentation</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-an-honor&quot;&gt;What an Honor!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a huge honor to present Make Weird Music to 850 people at &lt;a href=&quot;http://ignitephoenix.com&quot;&gt;Ignite Phoenix &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; #18 on April 1, 2016 at &lt;a href=&quot;http://scottsdaleperformingarts.org&quot;&gt;Scottsdale Center for the Performing Arts &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It was also one of the most nerve-wracking things I’ve ever done and it’s taken me several days to understand why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/YKqre-waCI8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special thanks to Raoul Encinas for telling me about Ignite and inviting me to submit, and to Todd Weinstein, who coached me through the whole process.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the weeks leading up to Ignite, I didn’t think too much about the reality of speaking in front of so many people. I also didn’t realize how personal my little speech would be and how vulnerable I would feel delivering it. Like a song idea in its infancy, I let no one hear me rehearse and only two people had seen the script I wrote: my assigned speaking coach and my awesome friend, &lt;a href=&quot;http://elevatingideas.com&quot;&gt;Will Mejia &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who designed the slides (and the MWM logo). Not even my wife really knew what I was cooking up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nerves&quot;&gt;Nerves&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I speak publicly on a regular basis for my job, it’s usually to a crowd of 50 or fewer people. Plus, when I do that, it’s usually in a controlled environment with people who are known to be interested. If there are slides, they’re on my laptop and I advance them when I’m ready. Most importantly, I rarely have to get candid about something so close to my heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;centered&quot;&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/mranathema/26156379521/in/photolist-FRmhmH-FXcA5z-FTe1by-FPDN4M-FvpA8N-FPE2ar-FRkujH-FP2xhq-FTekYj-F1g9ip-F2WzbM-Fx6ULU-FVvNnr-FP2xCq-F2XHpP-FXdrkP-F2XH4Z-FUUSNG-FUVCaw-F2KUpE-FXcii8-FUUu5L-Fx6RBs-FXdnWV-FP3zvm-FUUuxE-F2XEZt-FP3CgS-FUVyJy-FXdkiD-F2XC48-FyNE49-F4EoDK-FPDMSp-FPDKKD-FvpD61-FYyTo4-FQp49w-FWh1pL-FSH8Cc-F48iN5-FysdW5-F2LSVq-F1fPRe-FUVwaq-FRkAka-FXdmnn-Fx6KQh-FXciPP-F2KUby&quot; title=&quot;IgnitePhx18 (60 of 289)&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1472/26156379521_4dae5ea150.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; alt=&quot;IgnitePhx18 (60 of 289)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even though I play at church to a crowd of 800+ people on a regular basis, there is a bigger purpose to that and it has very little to do with me and my playing. At church, I am supporting an event and an environment that lets people tune themselves into the right spiritual mindset, like &lt;a href=&quot;/interview/kerry-minnear&quot;&gt;Kerry Minnear talked about in his interview&lt;/a&gt;. My Ignite presentation was about &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; passion, with no instrument speaking on my behalf or representing me to the crowd. Totally different from church!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of those things, plus some unpredictable personal and professional events/issues, led to my frenetic panic in the final 48 hours leading up to my presentation. My stomach was turning all day at work on April 1 and I was seriously regretting that I ever agreed to do it. I had a very real understanding of what artist &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_White_(artist)&quot;&gt;Wayne White &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; meant when he said, “&lt;a href=&quot;http://buy.beautyisembarrassing.com&quot;&gt;Beauty is embarrassing &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thanks-to-the-guitar-circle&quot;&gt;Thanks to the Guitar Circle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, I had a few tricks up my sleeve I’d learned from &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/king-crimson&quot;&gt;Robert Fripp&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Craft&quot;&gt;Guitar Circle &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; coursework. The practice of doing nothing, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_technique&quot;&gt;Alexander Technique &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and finding the silence within were all extremely helpful in soothing my nerves before the presentation. About 15 minutes before I had to go on stage, I realized how supportive the audience was and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.progressiveears.org/forum/showthread.php/15254-Mr-Fripp-not-amused-in-Toronto&quot;&gt;how much that factored into what Fripp shared during his 2015 tour with King Crimson&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;centered&quot;&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/nooccar/26137186551/in/photolist-FPDUXr-FvpoaQ-FTdXou-FTdTSS-F1fMUD-FvpdfE-FTedBA-FvpB45-F15y5W-FTe3qo-FTefPS-FVwa3e-FTeexd-FMm9f7-FPDZyv-FPEf9T-F15sD5-FPDGvc-FPE9Mk-F1ggLa-F1fVtM-FMkQau-F15wsY-F4oign-FPE6rH-F1g4q8-F1gjwR-FVvNEk-FPE4Qg-F1gahP-FMmeJU-FVw4sr-FvpuMs-F15s35-FPEaZR-FvppZb-FTe9WQ-FVw1LV-FPE9SR-F15mc7-F1fLWB-F48imJ-F4j1Gt-FSUDgt-FWh2pS-FSUCdM-FyDLrh-FSUCxK-F4sU4w-FyDLcu&quot; title=&quot;1604 IgnitePhx 1886&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1466/26137186551_55343c8668.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; alt=&quot;1604 IgnitePhx 1886&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It never dawned on me how important a supportive audience could be. It also never dawned on me how difficult an experience it could be to perform from the heart to an unsupportive audience. Had it not been for the wonderful support of the Ignite attendees, there is a high likelihood I would have bombed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that I didn’t bomb at all. The presentation went much better than I expected. I only screwed up on one slide and recovered in a decent way. And here it is on the Internet for all to see and (presumably) enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;so-personal&quot;&gt;So Personal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the practice in the world could not have prepared me for the experience of baring my soul to a crowd of that size. Practicing alone in a bedroom or while driving my car doesn’t leave room for audience laughter at my jokes, or for an emotional statement to make its mark. And to hear your own voice booming from loudspeakers in a non-nightmare context is a very strange thing. Thankfully, the stage lights were bright enough that I couldn’t make out a single face and the 5 minutes flew by faster than I could have expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who know me personally tell me that I’m often non-emotional or “cool as a cucumber.” Doing this presentation exposed a part of me that has been well-hidden (or perhaps dormant) for many years. I was so nervous throughout the day that after my presentation, I had to leave the building and almost went home sick from all the abdominal tension that was suddenly released once I was finished. I was in tremendous pain that, thankfully, went away after about an hour. The mind-body connection is real, yo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;centered&quot;&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/megawatson/25643147214/in/photolist-F4ZQgQ-F4ZL41-FX9x2Y-FzjPkq-F5bppH-FzjJQo-F4ZB9Y-FzjghN-F5aETF-FziYyC-F5ax4n-FRfySS-FZqkEz-F4YErG-FRftTJ-F4YB4E-FZqdWV-FRfpvA-FziEGW-FSv4FE-G1EQkg-F6dVaq-G1EAti-F6ppCg-F6p9P8-FYmQE3-FStVuG-F6cZxW-FUN8SP-F6oFCe-F6cXsJ-FYmGas-F6oBTa-G1DyNr-FYmCjG-FAx4wb-FYmzMY-FYmzo1-F6cNzd-F6ouCZ-F6otSF-FAwXRd-FUMRHV-FStzUE-F6omYa-G1DjDK-FAwQxA-FAwP1C-FYmajE-G1CVxp&quot; title=&quot;Ignite Phoenix 18 IMG_6088&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1526/25643147214_08621a0307.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; alt=&quot;Ignite Phoenix 18 IMG_6088&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am glad for the experience I had and grateful for the opportunity. It was great to hear the support of fellow enthusiasts of weird music. And many approached me afterward in gratitude for my work, which was totally unexpected and heartwarming. I don’t think it will lead to a great, big local following, but it was nice to have my 5 minutes of fame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is definitely nice to get back to normal life where I have no major deadlines with my MWM work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-ignite-phoenix&quot;&gt;What’s Ignite Phoenix?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ignite Phoenix, started in 2008 by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JMoriartyFOX10&quot;&gt;Jeff Moriarty &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is part of a larger &lt;a href=&quot;http://content.ignitetalks.io/about/&quot;&gt;Ignite Talks &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; movement that started in 2006. It gives passionate people a platform to present their personal pursuits in a 5-minute presentation format where 20 slides auto-advance every 15 seconds. It’s a very popular event here in the Phoenix, AZ area and tickets sell out in less than an hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the people behind Ignite are passionate volunteers and they really make it a magical, diverse event. I presented between someone who talked about collecting sports cards of female athletes and someone who talked about a foster program in Arizona. The variety of ideas was huge and I strongly encourage you to attend an Ignite event if there’s one near you. I’m not sure if I’d recommend speaking unless you’re really super-duper passionate about a topic and willing to get out there and share it in a way that is totally unique and frightening. If anything, the networking opportunities make it totally worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;centered&quot;&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/mranathema/25620057833/in/photolist-F2XuB4-F4EpLe-Fx6JyQ-F4tDtY-FT4wTk-F4EoEM-FQKoeq-Fx6M4Q-FQKpoE-FRmzrz-FXck4c-FVvGcv-Fx6JT7-FXd134-Fvpj6s-FvpsgW-F2XG8a-FUVrvq-F1gh18-FRmv96-FP2zeS-FP2zss-F2KNfW-FUVcuj-aa7HmR-FRmgyv-FVvYcM-FYVeRZ-FQKpFJ-FQKpDQ-F4tDWb-FyNEYA-FWCkRG-FT4xtt-F4tDR1-FYVf3k-F4Eqnz-FT4xJt-FQKpwq-F4tDtN-F4Eqqa-F4Eqpt-F4Eq1T-FyNEKE-F4Eq12-FWCkBU-F4EpC8-FWCk5S-FWCkg3-FWCkf1&quot; title=&quot;IgnitePhx18 (31 of 289)&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1702/25620057833_24e21c9c9b.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; alt=&quot;IgnitePhx18 (31 of 289)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much to the Ignite volunteer team. I am so humbled by what you do that I might find a way to volunteer at a future event!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Failure to Fracture, Episode 2</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;episode-2-picking-the-right-pick&quot;&gt;Episode 2: Picking the Right Pick&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago (almost to the day!), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dgmlive.com/diaries.htm?entry=3463&quot;&gt;Robert Fripp paid me a compliment in his online diary&lt;/a&gt; in response to videos and blog posts I’d written at that time about playing &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt;. He said, “Mr. Garone’s work on this is honourable, and has my respect.” This sentence motivated me for many years to continue pursuing &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, he made a recommendation that, for some reason, took me years to understand: use a sharp pick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/fracture/id978457922?i=978458012&quot;&gt;Purchase King Crimson’s &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt; on iTunes &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://store.nexternal.com/dgm/starless-and-bible-black-c228.aspx&quot;&gt;Or, purchase the album on Robert Fripp’s website &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;video&quot;&gt;Video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the video to accompany this episode of &lt;em&gt;Failure to Fracture&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VIDEO COMING SOON!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-failure-to-fracture&quot;&gt;What is &lt;em&gt;Failure to Fracture&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/learn/fracture&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Failure to Fracture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a video series I’ve put together about all the things that have stood in the way of my successfully playing the song &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/king-crimson&quot;&gt;King Crimson&lt;/a&gt; despite years and years of study, practice, writing, and making videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;episode-list&quot;&gt;Episode List&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/learn/fracture&quot;&gt;Episode 0: Introduction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/learn/fracture/picks&quot;&gt;Episode 2: Picking Picks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;picks-picks-picks&quot;&gt;Picks, Picks, Picks!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Mr. Fripp recommended use of a sharp pick, he wrote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The recommended pick is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guitarcraftguitars.com/picks.html&quot;&gt;a triangular Guitar Craft pick&lt;/a&gt;, of which there is a small production line, handmade in Japan by Mr. Hiroshi Iketani. If a Dunlop Tortex is the only choice, I would use the Tortex Sharp &amp;amp; consider that life was hard, cruel &amp;amp; unfair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I had no access to the triangular Guitar Craft pick at the time, I bought &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Dunlop-412P1-0-Tortex%C2%AE-Sharp-Players/dp/B000PTRJW8&quot;&gt;Dunlop Tortex Sharps&lt;/a&gt; and it made a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; difference in tone and accuracy. (I prefer the yellow .73mm ones.) Here’s what I love about them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They make your strings sound &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; brighter and more clear&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pick noise is severely reduced&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They’re slightly longer than a normal pick, so there’s more to grip&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reduces accidental string muting&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sounds much more like Fripp!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a normal pick makes it harder to play &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt; for the reasons I just listed. Normal picks don’t have the clear tone of a sharp pick. They’re noisy and make a lot of noise because you’re almost always rubbing the surface of the pick across a string instead of striking through a string. They’re shorter and not as grippy. Their shortness also makes it hard to let long notes ring during the “death picking” part of &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt;. And if you’re really trying to play like Fripp and sound like him, you’re not going to have good luck with a normal pick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;guitar-craft-triangular-picks&quot;&gt;Guitar Craft Triangular Picks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I attended the Guitar Circle intro course, some official india rubber Guitar Craft picks were available for purchase. It turns out there are two types of GC picks: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_rubber&quot;&gt;india rubber&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyoxymethylene&quot;&gt;delrin&lt;/a&gt;. My india rubber picks are shiny, slick, and fancier than the delrin ones. The delrin ones have a matte, fine texture and I prefer them to the india rubber ones. Guitarist &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.steveball.com/index.htm&quot;&gt;Steve Ball&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.steveball.com/words/history/PickHistory/&quot;&gt;a written history of the picks on his website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These picks are definitely, definitely awesome. Before I had any access to these picks, I bought every sharp pick I could find on the market. The only ones that even come close to the GC picks are the Tortex Sharps Fripp recommended. The biggest advantage (for me) to the triangular pick is that it doesn’t spin or move nearly as much when playing &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;other-sharp-picks&quot;&gt;Other Sharp Picks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I understand that it may be my own poor technique that leads to a spinning pick, but I can say that the triangular pick spins the least of any of the picks I’ve seen. Even as I’ve been making this series, I’ve worked pretty hard on my picking grip and have started re-evaluating other sharp picks as I’m learning to better control the pick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all this work, none of the other sharp picks I have come &lt;em&gt;close&lt;/em&gt; to the Tortex Sharps or the GC picks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Jim-Dunlop-478P-88-Tortex®-Players/dp/B00ISQCJRU&quot;&gt;White Dunlop Jazz III picks&lt;/a&gt; are the best of the rest. For GC-style picking that’s suitable for playing &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt;, these are pretty nice, though a little thick for my taste. The other Jazz III picks are just too thick for me.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Dunlop-433P-73-Ultex®-Sharp-Players/dp/B002IJK0H4&quot;&gt;Dunlop Ultex Sharp picks&lt;/a&gt; are fairly nice, but not nearly as “sharp” as the Tortex Sharps. I’ve found the curve near the point of the pick&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/DAndrea-TG355-96HV-Celluloid-Guitar/dp/B001RMDQCY&quot;&gt;D’Andrea triangle picks&lt;/a&gt; are really big. I’ve thought about cutting them down to the size of the GC picks, but then one of the sides would be unfinished and I don’t really think it’s worth it. Plus, the point isn’t very sharp.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Ibanez-Steve-Signature-Rubber-6-Pack/dp/B004CYEPD8&quot;&gt;Ibanez Steve Vai rubber grip picks&lt;/a&gt; are pretty nice picks overall, actually.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we’re on the subject of picks, there are some pretty crazy picks out there. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Ibanez-0-75mm-Sand-Grip-Plectrums/dp/B004CYEPGU&quot;&gt;Ibanez makes one with a sandpaper grip&lt;/a&gt;! I just ordered this crazy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.v-picks.com/product/shredder-lite/&quot;&gt;V-Pick “Shredder Lite” triangular guitar pick&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll see how that goes.&lt;/p&gt;
