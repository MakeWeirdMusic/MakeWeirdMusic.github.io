        <title>Failure to Fracture, Episode 2</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;episode-2-picking-the-right-pick&quot;&gt;Episode 2: Picking the Right Pick&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago (almost to the day!), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dgmlive.com/diaries.htm?entry=3463&quot;&gt;Robert Fripp paid me a compliment in his online diary&lt;/a&gt; in response to videos and blog posts I’d written at that time about playing &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt;. He said, “Mr. Garone’s work on this is honourable, and has my respect.” This sentence motivated me for many years to continue pursuing &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, he made a recommendation that, for some reason, took me years to understand: use a sharp pick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/fracture/id978457922?i=978458012&quot;&gt;Purchase King Crimson’s &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt; on iTunes &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://store.nexternal.com/dgm/starless-and-bible-black-c228.aspx&quot;&gt;Or, purchase the album on Robert Fripp’s website &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;video&quot;&gt;Video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the video to accompany this episode of &lt;em&gt;Failure to Fracture&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/o4f1POCrKXE&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-failure-to-fracture&quot;&gt;What is &lt;em&gt;Failure to Fracture&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/learn/fracture&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Failure to Fracture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a video series I’ve put together about all the things that have stood in the way of my successfully playing the song &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/king-crimson&quot;&gt;King Crimson&lt;/a&gt; despite years and years of study, practice, writing, and making videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;episode-list&quot;&gt;Episode List&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/learn/fracture&quot;&gt;Episode 0: Introduction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/learn/fracture/stress&quot;&gt;Episode 1: Stress and Tension&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/learn/fracture/picks&quot;&gt;Episode 2: Picking Picks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;picks-picks-picks&quot;&gt;Picks, Picks, Picks!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Mr. Fripp recommended use of a sharp pick, he wrote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The recommended pick is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guitarcraftguitars.com/picks.html&quot;&gt;a triangular Guitar Craft pick&lt;/a&gt;, of which there is a small production line, handmade in Japan by Mr. Hiroshi Iketani. If a Dunlop Tortex is the only choice, I would use the Tortex Sharp &amp;amp; consider that life was hard, cruel &amp;amp; unfair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I had no access to the triangular Guitar Craft pick at the time, I bought &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Dunlop-412P1-0-Tortex%C2%AE-Sharp-Players/dp/B000PTRJW8&quot;&gt;Dunlop Tortex Sharps&lt;/a&gt; and it made a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; difference in tone and accuracy. (I prefer the yellow .73mm ones.) Here’s what I love about them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They make your strings sound &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; brighter and more clear&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pick noise is severely reduced&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They’re slightly longer than a normal pick, so there’s more to grip&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reduces accidental string muting&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sounds much more like Fripp!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a normal pick makes it harder to play &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt; for the reasons I just listed. Normal picks don’t have the clear tone of a sharp pick. They’re noisy and make a lot of noise because you’re almost always rubbing the surface of the pick across a string instead of striking through a string. They’re shorter and not as grippy. Their shortness also makes it hard to let long notes ring during the “death picking” part of &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt;. And if you’re really trying to play like Fripp and sound like him, you’re not going to have good luck with a normal pick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;guitar-craft-triangular-picks&quot;&gt;Guitar Craft Triangular Picks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I attended the Guitar Circle intro course, some official india rubber Guitar Craft picks were available for purchase. It turns out there are two types of GC picks: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_rubber&quot;&gt;india rubber&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyoxymethylene&quot;&gt;delrin&lt;/a&gt;. My india rubber picks are shiny, slick, and fancier than the delrin ones. The delrin ones have a matte, fine texture and I prefer them to the india rubber ones. Guitarist &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.steveball.com/index.htm&quot;&gt;Steve Ball&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.steveball.com/words/history/PickHistory/&quot;&gt;a written history of the picks on his website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These picks are definitely, definitely awesome. Before I had any access to these picks, I bought every sharp pick I could find on the market. The only ones that even come close to the GC picks are the Tortex Sharps Fripp recommended. The biggest advantage (for me) to the triangular pick is that it doesn’t spin or move nearly as much when playing &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;other-sharp-picks&quot;&gt;Other Sharp Picks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I understand that it may be my own poor technique that leads to a spinning pick, but I can say that the triangular pick spins the least of any of the picks I’ve seen. Even as I’ve been making this series, I’ve worked pretty hard on my picking grip and have started re-evaluating other sharp picks as I’m learning to better control the pick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all this work, none of the other sharp picks I have come &lt;em&gt;close&lt;/em&gt; to the Tortex Sharps or the GC picks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Jim-Dunlop-478P-88-Tortex®-Players/dp/B00ISQCJRU&quot;&gt;White Dunlop Jazz III picks&lt;/a&gt; are the best of the rest. For GC-style picking that’s suitable for playing &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt;, these are pretty nice, though a little thick for my taste. The other Jazz III picks are just too thick for me.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Dunlop-433P-73-Ultex®-Sharp-Players/dp/B002IJK0H4&quot;&gt;Dunlop Ultex Sharp picks&lt;/a&gt; are fairly nice, but not nearly as “sharp” as the Tortex Sharps. I’ve found the curve near the point of the pick&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/DAndrea-TG355-96HV-Celluloid-Guitar/dp/B001RMDQCY&quot;&gt;D’Andrea triangle picks&lt;/a&gt; are really big. I’ve thought about cutting them down to the size of the GC picks, but then one of the sides would be unfinished and I don’t really think it’s worth it. Plus, the point isn’t very sharp.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Ibanez-Steve-Signature-Rubber-6-Pack/dp/B004CYEPD8&quot;&gt;Ibanez Steve Vai rubber grip picks&lt;/a&gt; are pretty nice picks overall, actually.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we’re on the subject of picks, there are some pretty crazy picks out there. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Ibanez-0-75mm-Sand-Grip-Plectrums/dp/B004CYEPGU&quot;&gt;Ibanez makes one with a sandpaper grip&lt;/a&gt;! I just ordered this crazy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.v-picks.com/product/shredder-lite/&quot;&gt;V-Pick “Shredder Lite” triangular guitar pick&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll see how that goes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Prog Cover of BWV 1060R by J.S. Bach</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In December 2013, I released a math-rock/progressive cover version of one of my favorite Bach compositions, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_concertos_by_Johann_Sebastian_Bach#Concerto_in_C_minor.2C_BWV_1060&quot;&gt;Concert for Violin and Oboe Mov. 1, Allegro (BWV 1060R) &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a total shred-fest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/OUDXsoV6-ak&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/concerto-for-violin-oboe-in/id767515367&quot;&gt;Purchase this song on iTunes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This performance features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sebastianlanser.com&quot;&gt;Sebastian Lanser &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/panzerballett&quot;&gt;Panzerballett&lt;/a&gt; on drums&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Adam Strand (an organist I met at my church) on keyboards&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bryce Bickham of &lt;a href=&quot;http://crimsontone.com&quot;&gt;Crimsontone Amplifiers &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Re-amp&quot;&gt;re-amped &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; all my guitar parts through his awesome handmade amps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sebastian’s drum parts are jaw-dropping. Andy’s bass parts are so fun. Adam’s arrangement contributions brought new life to my too-technical work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Artwork for my 2013 &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/bach?src=hash&quot;&gt;#bach&lt;/a&gt; shredfest. Thought it&amp;#39;d be funny to draw myself as Bach. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/F1QXIJX7u3&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/F1QXIJX7u3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Make Weird Music (@MakeWeirdMusic) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MakeWeirdMusic/status/708064442823479296&quot;&gt;March 10, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-and-why&quot;&gt;How and Why&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a piece of music I’ve loved for many years and always knew I wanted to record my own version. I put my stamp on it by messing around with the rhythm of the main motif, which is in 11/8. It took about 10 months to complete the arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s incredibly complex and difficult to perform, well beyond anything I’d previously recorded. There were several parts I couldn’t easily perform as originally written, so I translated those parts into different time signatures and added notes to make them playable. Some parts require some pretty tricky finger-tapping on both hands. It’s more like playing a keyboard on a fretboard than finger-tapping like Eddie Van Halen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I entered all the notes into Logic Pro and used its tablature features to determine the best way to play (and memorize) the various parts. Then I recorded all the parts direct into Logic and sent them to Bryce to re-amp through his beautiful Crimsontone Amps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sebastian, Andy, and Adam each told me that this was one of the hardest songs they’d ever performed. I guess that’s some sort of stamp of honor. Heh.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Panzerballett Typewriter Contest Entry</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In November 2015, &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/panzerballett&quot;&gt;Panzerballett&lt;/a&gt; launched a contest where fans could submit their cover of the song &lt;em&gt;Typewriter II&lt;/em&gt; off their new album, &lt;em&gt;Breaking Brain&lt;/em&gt;. Here is my entry for the competition:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/HRdk3HoknWk&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to know more about Jan Zehrfeld (the mad genius behind Panzerballett), you should &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/interview/jan-zehrfeld&quot;&gt;check out our extensive 5-part interview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, this was quite a bit of work and stretched my capabilities as a player and a person who makes videos on the internet. I’d never tried doing a split-screen effect before, which is tough in my humble little video studio. The sheet music Jan provided to contestants was difficult for me to read, so I had to put every note into a notation editor, then tab it all out so I could remember how to play it. I also improvised through my solos in an effort to retain Jan’s spirit of jazz and improvisation amidst a highly-composed piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For anyone wondering, that is a 6-string guitar with a banjo body called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.deanguitars.com/query?upc=819998000554&quot;&gt;Backwoods 6 Banjo &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which I picked up used for about $170. The acoustic is my trusty Alvarez Yairi DY-40. And the keyboard is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivetti_Lettera_32&quot;&gt;Olivetti Lettera 32 &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; lent to me by my good friend, &lt;a href=&quot;http://elevatingideas.com&quot;&gt;Will Mejia &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who also designed the MWM logo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took about 4 weeks to notate, learn, practice, record, and film the whole thing over many evenings from 9PM til about 1AM. All told, I’m guessing I spent about 60 hours on it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;download-the-mp3&quot;&gt;Download the mp3!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an mp3 of the song (NOTE: hitting the “play” button requires a hefty download of the entire audio file!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;audio src=&quot;http://audio.makeweirdmusic.com/share/typewriter/makeweirdmusic-typewriter.mp3&quot; controls=&quot;&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, &lt;a href=&quot;http://audio.makeweirdmusic.com/share/typewriter/makeweirdmusic-typewriter.mp3&quot;&gt;download an mp3 &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;original-recording&quot;&gt;Original Recording&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/breaking-brain/id1043463853&quot;&gt;Purchase Panzerballett’s &lt;em&gt;Breaking Brain&lt;/em&gt; on iTunes &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the official music video for the original recording of the song:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/5OGoftbnqLM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here’s a promo video for the new album:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/bEdh3IjJ9Gk?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;contest-info&quot;&gt;Contest Info&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial offering for winning the competition was free tickets and aftershow passes to see the band perform and hang out with them on one of their European tour dates. Since I live in the USA, the idea of making my own cover of the song was appealing, but geographically limited and financially impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Isvjirm1K8M?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months later, Jan announced there was a chance to win an Ibanez 8-string guitar. I saw that video and knew I had to cover the song in a unique way and make a fun video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/RbtWb6edQJ8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like what I’ve done, leave a comment and/or share the video. Thanks so much for checking this out! And thank you, Jan, for providing this opportunity to your fans. It was so much fun!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Favrio Guitars ATG7</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In January 2014, a friend of mine had shared one of my guitar videos on Facebook. A friend of this friend left a comment like, “I’d love if this guy would try one of my guitars!” His name is Rob Fick and he’s a guitar luthier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rob and I started chatting online about the guitars he’s built and his workshop. Then we started talking about building a custom guitar. I live in Arizona and our mutual friend is from Arizona, so I presumed this guy lived in Arizona. I said, “When can I come check out your shop?” and he wrote, “I’m in Bodrum, Turkey!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the logistical challenges, we decided to proceed with the custom “Anthony Garone Signature Model” anyway. He told me about some of the woods he had access to, which sounded intriguing: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millettia_laurentii&quot;&gt;wenge&lt;/a&gt;, Stradivari &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spruce&quot;&gt;spruce&lt;/a&gt; from E. Ciresa in Northern Italy, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapele&quot;&gt;sapele&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whos-behind-favrio-guitars&quot;&gt;Who’s Behind Favrio Guitars?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;asdf&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Failure to Fracture, Episode 1</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;episode-1-stress-and-body-tension&quot;&gt;Episode 1: Stress and Body Tension&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite quotes is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns&quot;&gt;this beauty &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Rumsfeld&quot;&gt;Donald Rumsfeld &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Reports that say that something hasn’t happened are always interesting to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns – the ones we don’t know we don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I look back at videos of myself playing &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt; as far back as 2006, I see someone who didn’t know what he didn’t know–someone confounded by the unknown unknowns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/fracture/id978457922?i=978458012&quot;&gt;Purchase King Crimson’s &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt; on iTunes &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://store.nexternal.com/dgm/starless-and-bible-black-c228.aspx&quot;&gt;Or, purchase the album on Robert Fripp’s website &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;video&quot;&gt;Video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the video to accompany this episode of &lt;em&gt;Failure to Fracture&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/o4f1POCrKXE&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-failure-to-fracture&quot;&gt;What is &lt;em&gt;Failure to Fracture&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/learn/fracture&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Failure to Fracture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a video series I’ve put together about all the things that have stood in the way of my successfully playing the song &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/king-crimson&quot;&gt;King Crimson&lt;/a&gt; despite years and years of study, practice, writing, and making videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;episode-list&quot;&gt;Episode List&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/learn/fracture&quot;&gt;Episode 0: Introduction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/learn/fracture/stress&quot;&gt;Episode 1: Stress and Tension&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/learn/fracture/picks&quot;&gt;Episode 2: Picking Picks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;self-taught-unknown-unknowns&quot;&gt;Self-Taught Unknown Unknowns&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started learning Fracture at the ripe young age of 18 or so–somewhere around the year 2000. My father had said to me, “Learn &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; I’ll talk to you.” He was trying to challenge me with impossible songs and I was doing my best to teach myself to play. My aim was to shred, not to play an instrument with ease nor to understand any of the musical concepts behind what I was playing. As a teenager, I wanted to play fast and loud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifteen years later at an introductory &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Craft&quot;&gt;Guitar Circle course &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Mexico, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Fripp&quot;&gt;Robert Fripp &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said to me (and 7 other introductory students), “Please raise your hand if you taught yourself how to play guitar.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I raised my hand as did a few others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fripp’s response was, “What you’re effectively telling me is, ‘Someone who knew nothing about music, nothing about the guitar, nothing about performance taught me everything I know.’” My internal response was a little defensive. I couldn’t help but admit that he was right, though. What had I really gotten out of studying recordings, reading magazines, and learning from transcriptions? The ability to move my fingers around on a fretboard through rote memorization?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[NOTE: For more intelligent discourse on this subject, check out &lt;a href=&quot;/interview/jeff-berlin&quot;&gt;the interview we did with Jeff Berlin&lt;/a&gt;. He has incredible insights about music education and being self-taught.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first few days of the Guitar Circle course focused on something called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_technique&quot;&gt;Alexander Technique &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; [AT] led primarily by two AT teachers with support from Robert and his “guitar buddies” (experienced co-instructors). I hated Alexander Technique. We spent a bunch of time talking about how to sit, how to stand, how to breathe, how to position your head on your neck… A few of us intro students were irritated and felt like it wasn’t a good use of our time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And every morning, we spent 45 minutes with Robert &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dgmlive.com/diaries.htm?diarist=3&amp;amp;entry=4424&quot;&gt;doing &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Literally. We sat in a room staring in silence doing nothing. It was surreal and, frankly, bizarre. I went from never thinking I’d meet Robert to sitting in a room with him staring at a wall at 7:45AM in a small town outside Mexico City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We barely seemed to do anything on the guitar until the third or fourth day. That’s when my back started &lt;em&gt;killing&lt;/em&gt; me with constant pain and burning. &lt;a href=&quot;http://sandrabaincushman.com/&quot;&gt;Sandra Bain Cushman &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said this pain was due to my body undoing all of the poor habits I’d developed over so many years of misuse of my body. Suddenly, I felt awakened to a new me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;change-is-good&quot;&gt;Change is good!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The practice of doing nothing started making sense. As Robert said, “You can’t ask your body to do something until it can appreciate doing nothing.” This practice was revealing a quiet, relaxed version of me that I always carry around, but never listen to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I picked up the guitar, I could feel my body fighting new, good use techniques with old, poor use techniques. From the way I sat, the way I positioned my skull on my neck, the way I automatically tensed up playing the guitar… It was incredible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next several months, I worked very hard at sitting regularly and doing nothing, paying close attention to where stress appears in my body during everyday moments, while at work, while walking, while playing guitar, and more. The more I loosened up, the more I was able to navigate the picking for &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt;. One night in August 2015, it happened! I immediately started filming myself and sent it to my friend, Yehuda Kotton, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiX_ewhngbA&quot;&gt;an Israeli guitarist from the band Ahvak &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; who’d also been working on learning &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the Alexander Technique and the practice of doing nothing, I have learned so much about myself and my habits. There is so much I didn’t know I didn’t know and I still discover new things about stress and tension in my body as I pick up the guitar and start playing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stress-is-visible&quot;&gt;Stress is visible&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time I play &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt;, I discover new areas where I’m stressing myself out. Most recently, the stress is appearing in my right forearm near my elbow and in my right shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A guitar instructor named &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reverbnation.com/glennwintersmith&quot;&gt;Glenn Winter-Smith &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; emailed me after &lt;a href=&quot;/learn/fracture&quot;&gt;Episode 0&lt;/a&gt; telling me he could notice that I wasn’t loosened up. Admittedly, the practice performance in that video was the 50th take over the course of 3 nights and I was stressed and tired from playing and filming myself, but more importantly was the fact that an experienced instructor noticed my stress despite a year of concerted effort in relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, he wrote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Your wrist and fingers on your picking arm could be a lot looser and manipulative than what they are,. I always tell my students to think ‘loosey goosey’,…pretend your arm is almost stuck in one position and you can only swivel/turn your wrist and swivel/turn your thumb/fingers with pick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still have a long way to go, but I know the goal is within reach.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Failure to Fracture</title>

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-failure-to-fracture&quot;&gt;What is &lt;em&gt;Failure to Fracture&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/learn/fracture&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Failure to Fracture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a video series I’ve put together about all the things that have stood in the way of my successfully playing the song &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/king-crimson&quot;&gt;King Crimson&lt;/a&gt; despite years and years of study, practice, writing, and making videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sheet-music&quot;&gt;Sheet Music&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/gear/soundslice&quot;&gt;Soundslice&lt;/a&gt; is an incredible web app that offers HTML5 sheet music without the need for Adobe Flash or any other plugins. It’s super-duper awesome and is hosting the sheet music you see here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-we-learning&quot;&gt;What are we learning?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past 15 years or so, I’ve been intensely studying a piece of music called &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/king-crimson&quot;&gt;King Crimson&lt;/a&gt; and have developed a unique type of expertise: the expertise of failure. &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt; is, without a doubt, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;the most difficult piece of music I’ve ever tried playing&lt;/span&gt;. Through study, practice, blogging, and YouTube videos, I have failed more visibly and effortfully than most anyone else on the internet attempting to play this song. This video series is an attempt to share what I’ve learned through my failures to save others the time and energy as they attempt to learn and play the piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/fracture/id978457922?i=978458012&quot;&gt;Purchase King Crimson’s &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt; on iTunes &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://store.nexternal.com/dgm/starless-and-bible-black-c228.aspx&quot;&gt;Or, purchase the album on Robert Fripp’s website &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More specifically, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I will only be focusing on the &lt;em&gt;moto perpetuo&lt;/em&gt; section&lt;/span&gt;, which starts at about 2:50 in the original recording and lasts (endures!) for about 4 minutes. “Moto perpetuo” is an Italian term meaning “perpetual motion.” It applies here because this section of &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt; is a barrage of 16th notes (or “semiquavers” as Robert Fripp, the British composer and performer of the song, might say).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People all over the world have contacted me about playing this song. They’ve kindly sharing videos of their own, offered their time via Skype to talk to me, etc. It’s been such a fun and humbling experience and I’ve met people from every continent! There is quite a community of Fripp-following guitarists and I’ve been overjoyed to meet so many of them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, please note that &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I am not teaching anyone how to play &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, but rather showing you all the ways I’ve discovered that will prevent or inhibit progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a video of the interview:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/jWeTqBNnA6g?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interview-transcript&quot;&gt;Interview transcript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;Anthony: I remember I used to follow you on Facebook and then I stopped and then a friend of mine (Andy Kub) a couple years later said, “You should follow Jeff Berlin.” I said, “Okay, I’ll do that.” And then I remembered the reason I stopped following you was because it was almost like you were inviting controversy at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;Now, just recently, you do a public apology to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Wooten&quot;&gt;Victor Wooten &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bailey&quot;&gt;Steve Bailey &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you’re talking about huge personal transformation and growth. Was it primarily your ego getting out of control and then you had a self-realization event? What led to what you’ve been going through and how were you operating at the time before that and how are you operating now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Jeff: Thanks for asking that because for me, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;this is more important than maybe music is right now.&lt;/span&gt; I grew up in a dysfunctional family. I know a lot of us have. The way that I ended up was hurt, ungrounded, out of balance, and the ego compensated. I’m doing this in a nutshell. All my life, since I was 18 years old, I felt something was wrong with me. I started, actually earlier than that, it was 18 that I went to therapy. Things were not right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I noticed people seemed to be content, seemed to be grounded. You know, everyone has their problems, but &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I could not get a grip or a handle on how people kindly and calmly get through life.&lt;/span&gt; And I’ve been in and out of therapy, my own voluntary seeking of it, since I was 18 years old. I’m 63 now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;When I was 60, I was just in a period where I did a lot of my Facebook stuff challenging, not polite, very hard-edged–it was just a symptom of even the messages in my columns, in my interviews, how I may have interacted with people–&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;it was all based in fear, all based in shame, it was all unhealthy and I could not resolve it. I tried.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;When I turned 60, I fell apart. I literally lost my mind and felt that this is the end. I understood why people commit suicide. I understood it. People commit suicide, I feel, when they feel there’s no option or hope to extract yourself out of the awfulness, the hopelessness, the pain, the fear–when you’re in this, you can’t imagine, people who’ve been through this can–the awfulness, you get to think it’ll never end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I have a guitar player friend here in Clearwater who recommended somebody who I went to and I went when I was 60. In this time, she was wired differently, let’s say. I still see this person and she was a licensed therapist who renounced her license, not believing in therapeutic things (her thinking) and went into a kind of a spiritual bent and she kind of amalgamated a soupy spiritual thing with therapeutic things and came up with something where, instead of “my mother did” and “you, Anthony, said” and “Victor Wooten and Steve Bailey and all bass players,” &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;instead of this, I went inside.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;And man, let me tell you, nothing was harder than to do that. Nothing.&lt;/span&gt; Because now whatever was going on wasn’t your doing or your fault or how you’re doing or “you don’t understand.” I spent about 7 or 8 months on the floor of my house, crying, sobbing, shaking like I was in an Exorcist movie, buddy. I mean, it was murder because feelings that I had suppressed–I don’t know. It’s not like, “Oh Mom did this and she said that and this happened and she said and not this,” &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;it’s that these things get internalized and they’re feelings so they started to come up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I was getting worse and worse and worse by each passing month. I would write to Beth because we have a communication relationship where I would see her and she would sit there and go, “Nope, you’re doing fine. You’re doing fine.” I said, “Beth! That ledge looks really good now, Beth!” “Nope, you’re doing fine.” And what she meant to say was that this was a passage where people often, in fear, don’t go through it all the way. I got on that train and I had to ride that train to its conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Ultimately, I felt–Can I tell you this? I felt on a Monday, I said, “Beth, it’s worse. I’m getting worse, Beth!” And I wrote her. She says, “Hang in. This is what you gotta go through.” Tuesday, I wrote her again because I was seeing her on Thursday or so. “I’m going crazy, Beth!” She says, “Nope, you’re doing fine. Hang in.” On Wednesday, Anthony, I was so bad I suddenly felt as if I hit bottom. I felt it. I physically felt hitting bottom and I went totally numb and I went, “What is this?” And from that moment, I started to get better. She said later, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;“You hit the bottom in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Night_of_the_Soul&quot;&gt;dark night of the soul &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (it’s called).”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/XN0TkIGsJak?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I was into spiritual pursuit and people experience this where the essence of what we construct for ourself collapses. When it collapses, we collapse. If everything you, Anthony, believe in falls apart, what are you? You know what the answer is? Nothing! And that, what you are, you’re nothing in the sense of everything you have and everything you believe in, it’s nothing, it’s false, it’s not real…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;When that happens, what do you do? What do you trust? Who are you? What are you to rely on? And that happened to me, man…&lt;/span&gt; Talk about losing your essential self as a human being because that’s what happens to people like me in the dark night of the soul. What happens is this is a healing process and then &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;as you come out of it, you reconstruct from another place, not a damaged place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;In the subsequent years, I would practice being nice. “Hi guys, I’m sorry I did this stuff.” Okay, three months later, “You know, you stupid idiots out there, you’re all…” And then I would catch on a couple months later and go, “Whoops, I’m sorry I did it again and I don’t know what happened. I feel so bad, I’m really…” And I did. I would work to be nice. “Hey Anthony! Hey! How you doing? Everything good?” You know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It wasn’t natural, but I did make the effort. And finally in December of this year (2015), I had another collapse. About a month before, I was dancing in Beth’s office, saying, “Man, I feel as great as I’ve ever felt.” And I did! I had this collapse and I said, “What the hell is going on here?” She said, “People sometimes get strong after their first diminished and long-term depression to be strong enough to experience the next stage in a collapse of something internal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And what happened here is I, for better or worse, even lost more ego ground. I feel it like talking to you now that what I’m discussing isn’t the ego part of me, which I recognize that sensation, and try and conscious–I’m conscious all the time. “Ah, there I am. I did this. I see.” The watcher part. I’ll give everyone a little test here to show you the different–if you’re interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/7emS3ye3cVU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Absolutely! I love this stuff!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: This stuff and the readings that I’ve done, the dark night of the soul, I’ve gotten videos from her about people lecturing on it, different aspects of spiritual growth. What is spiritualism? It isn’t [hands in prayer] “Ommm” or maybe it is! &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;But, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the natural you. You without the pollution&lt;/span&gt;, the “You know what? I hate the Pittsburgh Steelers! I only love the Raiders!” It’s a construction, in a sense, and if I could do away with and appreciate the Raiders &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the Steelers, although I’d probably prefer one or the other, that the sense is that there is a more natural sense of me that should have been before I was hurt and deviated from a healthy growth path. My parents unknowingly did this…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/steve-vai&quot;&gt;Steve Vai&lt;/a&gt; had a great example for me. I’m sorry to interrupt. This has been so helpful. He said, “A lot of people are holding this jar and the jar is empty. Every life experience you have gets put into that jar, every opinion you have gets put into that jar. And people end up believing that they are the jar or the contents of the jar. But, you’re still the person holding the jar. You’re &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; that person that has these experiences. You are the person holding those experiences!” My boss said, “Just because someone makes you a crap sandwich doesn’t mean you need to eat it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;It’s kind of like: &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;we have a choice of taking what’s in this jar and believing it’s us, or believing that we are the person holding the jar and that the jar and its contents do not define us.&lt;/span&gt; Other people, no matter what they stick in there, that doesn’t need to change who we are. We’re not in touch with being that person holding the jar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Fripp&quot;&gt;Robert Fripp &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is all about this notion that we are–well, there’s a guy named &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gurdjieff&quot;&gt;Gurdjieff &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that he follows, this philosopher, and that most people are in a sleeping walking state, almost like zombies and we’re never truly awakened. So, all of this stuff has been so central to a huge transformation in my own life since September 2014. Just huge for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;The conversation with Steve and then the guitar camp with Robert Fripp and then all the other experiences and all the reading, so I’m glad I haven’t had a dark night of the soul, I’m lucky and very fortunate to not have had that, but those examples right there really feed into my understanding of what you’re talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: I think Steve nailed it and it’s true. I agree with him. I’ll give you a little example of the person you are rather than the person who thinks and this goes for everybody else. I’d like to do a little experiment and here it is. In your mind, say the word, “House.” Tell me when you did it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: In your mind, louder, say the word, “House.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: And the final one, in your mind, scream as loud as you can the word, “House.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: Here’s a question and I’m curious what you would say. Did you notice in all three experiences there was a part of you watching?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Oh yeah. Absolutely. The third one especially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;And this is an indication of something that I’ve been developing because in the sleeping mode that you’re discussing, many of us are sleeping and usually people that are highly opinionated, gossipy people, opinionated to the degree that I know I’m opinionated in music ed, opinionated for its own sake, which is what I used to be, are asleep.&lt;/span&gt; We are governed by the thoughts, not only the jar, but the things like, “I like this football team,” and, “Metronomes are bad.” Why? Just because I say so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: “&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_monkey&quot;&gt;The monkey mind &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” Fripp calls it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/yCBalosvT9U?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: The monkey mind! See, good for Fripp. I’m joining an elite club, and so are you I think. We like to invite people to join us. It’s a good thing, especially us being the sick or the damaged or the mentally unhealthy or the soul-spiritually-imbalanced people that are seeking and getting better. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I never thought I’d find this kind of balance and now that it’s happening to me, I never thought it would come, man.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, I just wanted to point out that in the development, we develop that watcher part and that’s when I began to see this ego part who went, “Ah well, Anthony… Weird! What a funny word. Anthony and his weird .com.” And of course, that’s not the watcher, the guy who screamed, “House,” perhaps. Or screamed “cookie.” That is, in a nutshell, what I am developing. It’s very important to me. I probably talked too much about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I don’t think so. To me, it’s the stuff of life and you don’t realize the value of it. Like you said, you don’t think you’ll ever get there, and then when you’re there you realize you could have had it the whole time. It’s not so distant, it’s not so hard, but we spend decades defending a worldview with rules and opinions and these kinds of things that we grow to believe, “These must be true!” And when somebody does something that violates some of the rules, or makes us feel jealous or something like that, it’s because we’re defensive. It’s our ego saying to us, “That person doesn’t live by your rules and that person is doing well.” You know? What’s wrong with &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;? Why can’t you do that? You know the rules. It’s been &lt;em&gt;hugely&lt;/em&gt; transformational stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: Yeah, and I appreciate that too. By the way, this probably should be a two-parter, shouldn’t it? Maybe a 5-parter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: If you need to get going, we can end it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: No! I’m happy to chat. It’s just I would assume a lot of this is going to make people go, “Oh yeah.” [Snoring.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I don’t know. The Steve Vai one, people are eating it up. They love the non-musical/musical context. A great exercise that I read about is if you envision in your mind a room with two doors. If you think of a difficult situation, something that made you upset, let that come in through one door. The two doors are on opposite ends of the room. Let it come in to one door and you visualize it and get a sense of what it is and it might look like colors, shapes, sounds, whatever. You watch it from a distance and you get to develop a familiarity with that feeling and you wait for it to leave out the other door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;If you do this mental exercise for long enough, these feelings that you get, these feelings of discomfort or ego or whatever it is, you start to train yourself that things enter and then they leave. You also teach yourself that you can have compassion for these feelings. And, when these things come up in your life, you teach yourself that they will leave, that it’s not permanent. “This feeling, I know what this feeling is.” As soon as you feel it, you know what it is. It’s this thing entering the door and you know what it looks like because you’ve studied it. And we spend so much of our lives avoiding these feelings, but…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: Which is what my dark night was. It was all my life avoiding things and you said you hope you don’t get it and you probably won’t. The dark night could be different. You could be just sort of depressed or just sort of down. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Mine was an utter and absolute loss of self. That, for a highly egotistical being, loss of self is freaking terrifying.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, somebody like you, who I sense is a sort of a lower-keyed guy, if comes a time where your system decides to auto-correct, you may just sort of, “Man, I don’t feel so great.” And it won’t be as awful, but it is predictable. And you will emerge. And really, often, there’s nothing to do about it except recognize it. You said to, honor those parts that come through the door?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Have compassion for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: Have compassion for. That’s a good synonym for my world, which is “love it.” &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;There’s a part of me that was so badly hurt that it caused the ego to say, “Well, I’m the best. If you don’t study like I say, you’re a doodoo,” which is an industry term for “poopoo.”&lt;/span&gt; In my case, I’ve learned to love this injured part and I would embrace it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I actually gave myself permission recently, not terribly long ago, I made a declaration and it’s made a difference in my life, which is &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;no matter what I feel, no matter how I feel it, I’m going to honor it and I’m going to feel it.&lt;/span&gt; I’m going to let it come and I’m never going to restrict or restrain. If I’m in the middle of a session, I guess I won’t pay too much attention, but later at the hotel, I will lay down and I’ll go back to that and I’ll bring it up. I’ll bring it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s that integration element that these things that were not known and not dealt with are now–okay, they come up and, “Okay, I feel this, oh my goodness yes, oh I’m so mad! Yes you are.” It sounds a little silly, but &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I feel a great deal of the ill psyche in me and I’m as grateful as can be, man. I’m really grateful. My bass playing is better.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I was gonna ask that. Over the decades, how did your ego influence what you were playing and now that you know that feeling–you said you have a new awareness for when the ego pops in–how does that affect you as a musician and as a bass player?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: Well, I feel I’ve never played better and &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I feel that pretty much my entire musical career is a fraud. It’s a fraud in the nature of what I constructed it on.&lt;/span&gt; So, it’s an honest and, I feel, a true assessment. I agree I played maybe music that people may enjoy, but I played a lot of stuff that was, “Love me. Love me. Love me! Love me! &lt;em&gt;Love me!! Love me!!&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: All right, well, I’m gonna get rid of this then. [Holds up Bruford’s “One of a Kind.”]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Well, that thing endures and I’m grateful for it, those Bruford things.&lt;/span&gt; That was the thing of this. I mean, “Love me love me love me,” fast, fusion, grrrr… And &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; I’ve found a whole new way to play bass. I’ve found other things. My playing isn’t as virtuosic because, quite frankly, I don’t qualify anymore. Not with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrien_Feraud&quot;&gt;Hadrien Feraud &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and that new young crew of firebrands around. You know, these guys are simply beyond belief! &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I’d be foolish if I were in my ego state, “All these young kids! I’ll show them a thing or two!” Which probably would have been my bent a while ago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/GZ_VzFq5ZSQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So now that I’ve kind of abandoned that kind of “need to” whatever, I’ve come 1. to love these guys and respect the living heck out of them, and 2. with a calmer nature as a bass player, I said, “Wow, look at this! I’m finding some interesting new things!” And so, it’s the liberation and allowing the spirit to flow and I never knew what spirit was and I guess I’m still not sure. I guess I take it to mean “the natural me.” What I was, as I said earlier, what I was meant to be. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Yeah, my bass playing is satisfying. It’s great! It’s flowing out of me like juice out of a blood orange.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Have you written any new songs since going through this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: Yes. Not a lot, but I have. I’m not what I would call a gifted composer. I’m more of a “worker at it” composer. Some guys have that gift. I’m sorta like, “Da da da da da da da.” No. “Da da da da DAH da da.” No. “Da da da da DAH da da da DAH da da.” Okay that one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Do you compose on the bass? I see you doing keyboard gestures. Do you write on the keyboard?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: Yeah, on keyboard and on bass. I write on both. I’m fortunate. I write a lot of nice bass things now that are slightly different. [Bass gesture] This is bass. [Keyboard gesture] This is piano. [Trombone gesture] This is slide trombone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: [Violin gesture] This is violin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: [Flaps arms like a chicken] This is wock-a-doo-wock-a-doo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Frank Zappa [hair curl gesture], this is reggae, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Frank was an interesting guy, man! He’s a guy that I think would have benefited from spiritual pursuit.&lt;/span&gt; He had a lot of angst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: You played with him for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: I did and &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I got myself thrown out of a band through bad behavior. You know. And rude attitude. I’m telling you, man, I left bodies in the wake. It was a lot of humble pie.&lt;/span&gt; A &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of humble pie that I have to eat in order to own my thing and grow from there, so I’ve come to develop a rather appreciative taste for humble pie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So, you did lose opportunities as a result of this attitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: I lost them and I threw them away. I burned bridges. I was fairly out of my mind and fairly out of control. You can find a lot of that stuff on the internet. There’s not too much hidden evidence of that. You know what karma is? You’ve gotta pay the tab, man. You know the dark night? You gotta pay the tab. I put something out, I’ve gotta pay the bill for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And that &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; is in one way why I confess these stories and open up like that because I don’t want anything to be hidden, I don’t want to lie about anything, I don’t want to make one flipping excuse about anything in me that I’ve earned. So, I’m okay with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Good!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: You’re getting maybe more of a sense of the kind of guy, at least today, maybe in 3 months I’ll be different again because I feel calmer, I feel more loving, I feel more centered, more grounded, I still think music education needs fixing, I still think I need to practice my bass, I still think Victor Wooten and Steve Bailey are helping people and doing well for people and I owe them an apology and other people, if I’ve cast aspersions against them and all other teachers. I still feel metronomes don’t work, but if people wish to use them, of course they should, so I’m firm in my thing. Apologetic where it needs to be and I’m fine with it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Have you heard from any of these people that you’ve apologized to or you feel like in the past you might have wronged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: Give me a second, I want to answer. Not really. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;You know, I’ve apologized before and fell back, so I don’t think they’re wrong.&lt;/span&gt; “Here Berlin goes again, man. Apologizing and then the next thing he’s like, ‘Don’t slap bass! Don’t use a fretless!’ I’m not sure what.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Well, if I go through a dark night of the soul, your phone’s gonna ring at 2 in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: You can call any time and your dark night I’m fairly imbued with a little bit of an understanding of things. Again, that doesn’t make me anywhere qualified as a teacher or expert in any way, but I do have a sense of things now that I didn’t. If you do experience it, it will be a tolerable and less vicious form than mine because you aren’t losing a great deal of that collapse where you’re a more solidly-formed, emotionally-stable guy than I was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s like a house falling down, or the Empire State Building falling down, or (forgive me) the Twin Towers falling down. Bad analogy. It’s that collapse. That collapse was me and it was devastating. And then it was necessary. So you said, “I hope,” and it didn’t happen. You know what ironically happens to guys like me that go through it? We’re as grateful as ever for the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yeah, I bet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: I went through murder, man. Really murder. Hell. I thought thoughts. I said, “I can’t tolerate this. Bye world, I’m gone. Do it.” Something said, “I gotta get through this.” Beth helped me out, I read a lot of literature, I cried, I suffered, I shook. I apologized, “Oh what did I do? What did I say? What is this? What is this?” And finally it just began to ease up and now I play bass pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Well thank you so much for sharing this very human story. I really appreciate it and I think it takes a lot of bravery and candor and it’s really kind of you to offer this time and these words. So, thank you so much Jeff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: I’m honored to be here and thank you for the chance and the opportunity. I apologize if I talk too much. It’s actually something I’m attending to in my therapy. This need to just go blah blah blah bleh bleh blah blah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I love it. Don’t apologize. There’s no need. Thank you so much, Jeff. Maybe in a few months, we can talk again and see where things are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: I would like that. I would like that very much. I wish you well and hi to everybody. Thank you for listening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: All right, Anthony. Cheers, buddy.&lt;/p&gt;
