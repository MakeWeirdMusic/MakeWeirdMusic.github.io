        <title>Mats/Morgan Live with Norrlandsoperan Symphony Orchestra</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;video&quot;&gt;Video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/b51700LPExs?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mats/Morgan is an experimental jazz/rock duo from Umea, Sweden featuring Mats Oberg on keyboards and &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/morgan-agren&quot;&gt;Morgan Agren&lt;/a&gt; on drums. Their latest release is a concert they filmed and performed in 2017 with the Norrlandsoperan Symphony Orchestra conducted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://tomtrapp.net&quot;&gt;Tom Trapp &lt;i class=&quot;far fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Umea. The concert was a major achievement for the group as it’s something &lt;a href=&quot;/share/morgan-agren/morgchestra&quot;&gt;we’d talked to Morgan about&lt;/a&gt; in December 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ad&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buy “Live with the Norrlandsoperan Symphony Orchestra” &lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.morganagren.com/butik/cd/matsmorgan/mats-morgan-live-with-norrlandsoperan-symphony-orchestra/&quot;&gt;on Morgan Agren’s onine store &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm far fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new release comes with three discs: a DVD video of the performance, a CD containing the audio from the concert (same as the DVD), and Morgan’s previously-released &lt;em&gt;Through the Eyes of the Morgchestra&lt;/em&gt;. It’s very well packaged and affordably priced considering all of the content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I have one thing to say about this collection: &lt;strong&gt;It is perfect&lt;/strong&gt;. Seriously, the video is excellent, lots of fun to watch, well-edited, well-colored, and more. The audio is fantastic. There’s not a boring song to skip. It’s just wonderful, unique, complex, and musical. It is &lt;em&gt;so musical&lt;/em&gt;. I love it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morgan released this album as part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/804823372/morgan-agren-mats-oberg-cds-dvds-urgent-hearing-tr&quot;&gt;a kickstarter to raise funds for his best friend Mats &lt;i class=&quot;fab fa-kickstarter&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who was born blind and is now having trouble with his hearing. The original goal of the crowdfunding was around $15,000 USD and the fans contributed more than $47,000 USD altogether! Incredible! This will make a big difference for Mats/Morgan and allow Mats to see one of the best doctors in the world for his hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Altogether, if you’re a fan of this website, you have to buy this release. It’s emblematic of the kind of thing we hope to promote on the site: an adventurous, artistic, creative pursuit of music.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Evil Genius and Studio Opening</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;studio-grand-opening-concert&quot;&gt;Studio Grand Opening Concert&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you who follow our activities closely, you’ll know from social media that I’ve been building a new video studio in my backyard to accommodate all the MWM work, as well as making a space for doing my day job remotely. It’s been an exhausting (and sometimes fun) project, but it’s finally “done.” Well, it’s done enough to be usable. And to commemorate the grand opening of the studio, I invited the band &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/evil-genius&quot;&gt;Evil Genius&lt;/a&gt; out to my house and they performed a show! Super cool!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/UEa2NuhAZA8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s one of the songs I requested, called &lt;em&gt;Colonel Karl Marx and Keenan McCardell&lt;/em&gt; from their excellent new album &lt;a href=&quot;https://evilgeniustrio.bandcamp.com&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Experiments on Human Subjects&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;fab fa-bandcamp&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and until I do a final video about the studio, here’s a little about the project while I was working on it:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Divine Abstract by Charlie Cawood</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;video&quot;&gt;Video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/hc3BSjGR2kc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;audio-only-podcast&quot;&gt;Audio-Only (Podcast)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(NOTE: hitting the “play” button requires a hefty download of the entire audio file!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;audio src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/audio.makeweirdmusic.com/share/charlie-cawood/the-divine-abstract.mp3&quot; controls=&quot;&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, &lt;a href=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/audio.makeweirdmusic.com/share/charlie-cawood/the-divine-abstract.mp3&quot;&gt;download an mp3 &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm far fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charlie Cawood’s &lt;em&gt;The Divine Abstract&lt;/em&gt; is a work of art. It is immensely and entirely beautiful, full of wonderful rhythmic and melodic content. It brings together Eastern and Western music in a cohesive way. There’s no MIDI, there’s no sampling, there’s only one keyboard part. Every instrument is performed by a real human being, carefully selected by Charlie based on their ability on specific instruments. It’s the kind of album you can listen to while meditating, while working, or while doing nothing else but listening. For every purpose, I’ve found it offers great joy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ad&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buy “The Divine Abstract” as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://charliecawood.bandcamp.com&quot;&gt;digital download on Bandcamp &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-bandcamp&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s just a few bucks and is worth every penny. Check it out!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more I’ve listened to this album, the more indescribably beautiful it becomes. The melodies linger and are easy to sing, but there’s so much interesting supporting material for discerning listeners. It’s well-recorded, well-mixed, and just fun. It’s an adventurous piece of music and I’m glad to have it in my collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This interview is particularly insightful. Not only does Charlie have a deep grasp on the history of the dozens of instruments featured on the record, but he understands their purpose, their texture, their timbre, their roles in an ensemble. He shares with us the path he’s taken to get here, including a deep look at his depression and anxiety, which has been extremely challenging for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We cover a lot of ground in this conversation and I hope you enjoy it as much as I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interview-transcript&quot;&gt;Interview Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Charlie Cawood is a multi-instrumentalist from London who is a member of the band &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knifeworld&quot;&gt;Knifeworld &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and has released a solo album called The Divine Abstract. Charlie, thank you so much for joining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: Real pleasure, Anthony. Thanks for having me on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah, no problem. So, tell us a little about yourself and tell us about your album, The Divine Abstract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: Well, I’ve been playing music since I was about 11. I just started getting into playing guitar, studying classical guitar and electric guitar at the same time. Listening to mainly rock music, I suppose, and then very gradually started getting into Indian classical music, some Spanish music, and sort of wanted to get an active involvement in these types of music. So I started studying sitar when I was about 13 years old and continued from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/WzXVxOT8an0?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Later on, got into other Asian music. Japanese music, Chinese music, and then started picking things up along the way. Then, eventually went on to studying seriously at the London Center for Contemporary music and later, SOAS, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAS,_University_of_London&quot;&gt;School of Oriental and African Studies &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in London. I was studying at the same time Western popular music, jazz, classical, rock, blues, all the stuff you learn in music college, but at the same time had this real serious interest in other types of music and wanted to have some kind of active participation in it. So I learned about Balinese gamelan when I was at SOAS and then straight away when I graduated, started going to sessions and learning about it and playing. I’ve been doing that for six years now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I also was lucky enough when I was studying to be taught things like orchestration and arrangement and all of these more elaborate things that you don’t get taught in many places. And then gradually started getting interested in other music. Lots of contemporary classical music, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Reich&quot;&gt;Steve Reich &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Stravinsky&quot;&gt;Igor Stravinsky &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, practically minimalist and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivier_Messiaen&quot;&gt;Messiaen &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and all. I was kind of influenced by lots of different types of music from everywhere. Originally the music I was listening to on the rock side of things was fairly ordinary. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Maiden&quot;&gt;Iron Maiden &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Religion&quot;&gt;Bad Religion &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;s and stuff like that. Still into it, but then in my late teens, started hearing things more like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Zappa&quot;&gt;Frank Zappa &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Davis&quot;&gt;Miles Davis &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiacs&quot;&gt;Cardiacs &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were a particular revelatory experience for me. And I got to see their last-ever London show back in 2007, which was quite a moment of epiphany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;The Divine Abstract–I didn’t know it was going to be an album until half of it was already written because it was part of that process of becoming immersed in other types of music. Having interest in all sorts of different types of music. I didn’t really see any sort of disconnection between them. And so I was writing pieces that had some elements of Indian classical music and had an element of contemporary classical and I was trying to get Chinese elements in there and this sort of cyclicity of Balinese gamelan. And then, about halfway through writing all the pieces, I realized, “Actually, these have got a sort of shape to them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;The album didn’t really–I didn’t think of it as being an album until half the pieces were written and all written for different reasons. Some were written while studying, some of them were informal commissions from people. Actually, one of them was written–“Garden of the Mind,” which is in the middle of the album–it was written for an ensemble in the [United] States who never ended up playing it because it was too difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And then, I think it was actually Kavus [Torabi] from Knifeworld that heard a demo of that and said, “Well, this sounds like a thing. You should put it out when it’s done.” And then, that was the point where I realized, “Oh actually all along I’ve been writing this–it’s got a kind of shape to it. There’s a kind of arc running through these pieces.” So I started writing stuff that would become the later part of the album, things like “The 32nd Path.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And I always knew it was going to be this quite ambitious effort that’s going to necessitate lots of different instruments. It was going to draw upon lots of different things. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I wasn’t quite sure for a long time how well these tunes would actually sit together as an album. Would it really work?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I turned freelance about seven years ago and started playing in all kinds of different projects and working as a full-time musician and teaching and all of that stuff. So I was playing in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knifeworld&quot;&gt;Knifeworld &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from about 2012 and working with them quite extensively and also working in other bands like &lt;a href=&quot;https://tonochrome.bandcamp.com/&quot;&gt;Tonochrome &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-bandcamp&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; started around that time. I was playing in an art rock band called &lt;a href=&quot;https://spiritwo.bandcamp.com/&quot;&gt;Spiritwo &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-bandcamp&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which had Bob Leith from Cardiacs on drums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So I was playing all these different things and being fairly young and in this state of working on lots of things at once, it’s always your own project that gets put to the side. I always knew it was going to be quite a difficult thing to orchestrate and finish off. I did actually start rehearsing bits of it and making tentative recordings about four years ago. I had made a concerted effort to try and get the thing done, but then I started getting into a state of depression more and more. That’s when that period started, around then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Also around that time I started touring with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medi%C3%A6val_B%C3%A6bes&quot;&gt;Mediaeval Baebes &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who I was a multi-instrumentalist for. And so, again, it was another thing that I put on the back burner for a while because I was working on so much. Then, it was around late 2016, I had that fairly low period, which I’ll talk about a bit more later. I just knew that this had to be done, so I started finishing off and orchestrating the last two or three tunes on the album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y2MQbUTmvFo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I got in contact with my friend Amir Shoat, who’s a really good engineer and producer who I worked with before in London. I got together with him with all the demos and everything that had been recorded so far and, “Okay, well this is the thing.” With his advice and help and support, I was able to think of how to approach this because I knew it would necessitate loads of different instrumentalists and I knew it was going to be quite difficult music to put together and edit and mix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;The original demos didn’t really sound that cohesive as a thing. They sort of sat and it sounded like these could have come from different places. That was one thing we had to be careful of: making sure that they all sounded like they all flowed and they all sounded like from one place. The remaining few months I managed to call up loads of musician friends who’d be up for playing on it and contributing. In that time of me being a freelancer in London, I’d been lucky enough to meet all these different people who ended up on the record. Some of them I didn’t know when I first started writing it, so it’s almost as if it needed that time to gestate and slowly develop because some of the musicians who made the most important contributions on the album, I didn’t meet until a couple years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It just seemed right to have them on there and it all worked out for the best, really. The whole thing of doing it, because it was quite an intense period having to record everything and then do all the editing myself, it was the two of us mixing it. It was quite intense, but it felt like I was doing the right thing. I was finally focused on what I should be focusing on. It was such a relief to finally have it done, because the very last tune on the album–most of the tunes are fairly sequential but it’s almost in a sort of consecutive order from when they were written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;The first tune on the album is the earliest one and the very last tune on the album I didn’t finish writing until about a year ago. It was this sort of big seven-year arc that covered the whole writing process, which happens to play out in 45 minutes. It’s like it covers quite an expanse of life, as it were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: That’s actually something I really love about the album. It is such a rich and layered album with so many different textures and sounds. Can you talk a little about the instrumentation? How many different instruments are on the album and how many of them do you play yourself? For people who may not know who you are, you are a bit of an enthusiast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: Yeah. In terms of what I played personally on the album, I didn’t necessarily want myself to be the focus instrumentally, so obviously I’m playing acoustic guitar and classical guitar and bass, but a lot of the melodic focus is taken up by the instruments I orchestrated for, like the woodwinds and the strings and pitch percussion and pianos and Chinese instruments and things. Mainly because I like music that’s texturally rich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I’ve been a guitar player since I was 11 and I’ve been through the whole period of wanting to hear lots of guitar music, but &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;there was a point where I wanted to hear music which had lots of different textures in it&lt;/span&gt;, lots of different sounds and instrumentation. Not necessarily needing the guitar to be a focal point and that’s what I wanted to get in my own music as well. I wanted to have all these guitar parts that are kind of the skeleton of the tune. The tunes were written on guitar and then later orchestrated, but I didn’t necessarily want it to be the focus all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So I played all the guitar parts and I also played sitar, Indian sitar on the very first track. On several of the other pieces, I play Chinese pipa, which is this sort of pear-shaped lute thing that you see behind me there. Apart from that, I didn’t want to shoehorn in any of the other instruments I play onto the album. There’s a lot to choose from, but I didn’t necessarily want to try to get them all on there. It’d be sort of unnecessary and sort of inappropriate to do that. So that’s why there are twenty other musicians on the album. I couldn’t tell you how many instruments there are in total, but there’s a fair amount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/LdygoJ0kZCY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: A few dozen, probably? [Laughs.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: Probably yeah, because seven of those instruments are doubled up. Lucie Treacher, who plays on “The 32nd Path,” she layered all the gamelan instruments that are on there. There’s about 8-10 different gamelan instruments on there that she did in the course of one day. We just multi-tracked them and I’d take them all and edit them later. There’s all kinds of things on there. It’s kind of what I like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: One of the things that I love about these instruments is sometimes it’s even hard to tell if it’s a vocal part or a woodwind, if it’s a human-created sound. Sometimes it sounds like keyboards, but I’m pretty sure you don’t have any keyboards on the album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: Only piano.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Right, but no synthesizers or electronic instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: There’s some Mini Moog on one track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: On “The 32nd Path” and the piano and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celesta&quot;&gt;celesta &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Samples, but they’re still samples of an acoustic instrument, so there’s no synth pads or anything like that and there’s no midi at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah so can you talk a little about the challenges of even engineering a record where–I wouldn’t know where to put a microphone on half of the instruments that you’re recording. So, what was that experience like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: Neither would I, so that’s why I was so lucky to have my friend Amir working with me because he’s a real genius for recording acoustic sounds. He’s involved in lots of electro-acoustic music and experimental music and he does live sound, but he’s got this incredibly meticulous approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;We’d have instrumentalists come in and sit with their instrument and he’d get them to play and sort of stalk around them finding the sweet spot where, “Okay, this is where we’re going to put a mic.” And then, “Maybe we’ll just have one mic in a very sweet location.” Some of them we might double up. He knows exactly what sort of microphones to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Working with an engineer like that who, with that kind of attention to detail, almost obsessive attention to detail when recording acoustic sounds, otherwise it wouldn’t have been possible and it wouldn’t have sounded as rich as it does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s interesting what you said about how some of the melodic instruments almost sound like vocals because even though it’s fairly strange music and it’s very dense music, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I wanted all along for it to have a very strong melodic focus.&lt;/span&gt; I like melody. Also I wanted this music to be able to tell its own narrative without the need for lyrics or voice. I think it’s totally possible to do that over the course of the album just using instrumental music. I love vocal music, but I find it more universal in a way. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;It gets to a deeper state, I think, on certain instrumental music.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But in terms of how I approached the recording of many of the instruments, it’d often be through collaboration. I’d get them to do a few takes of just playing the part straight. It’s all orchestrated, so it all exists in notation they’re reading. So once we’re happy with the part, I’d then get them to phrase it however they want. A really good example of that is on “Garden of the Mind.” There’s some brilliant clarinet playing by my friend Nicki Maher, who I used to play with in a band called Opaz [Ensemble], which was a sort of Turkish gypsy band with elements of Arabic and Kurdish and other things. I used to play in a band with her doing that kind of repertoire and she also plays G clarinet, which is much deeper–she doesn’t play it on the album, but it informs her phrasing doing all these melismas and quarter tones. It’s very colorful, decorative playing. It’s really expressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I recorded her just doing the part straight just to have it safe and then just said, “Okay, now play it however you want it. Just make it sound Turkish or play it the way you would play it.” And then she played all these brilliant–it’s the same notes, but she played it in her way. It’s like, every time I listen to that tune, it’s like, “Okay, there’s Nicki.” It’s just her characteristic and the other instruments I chose specifically for their richness in color. Say, on the three tracks that comprise the “Earth Dragon” set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;There’s a Chinese instrument called an erhu, which is a two-string spike fiddle. It’s a really simple instrument, but what it can do is it can sound incredibly emotional and expressive because of all these different ornaments that it can do. Again, that was another instrument I was really lucky to get because there are barely any professional players of that in London. At least, not many who would be able to play stuff that’s rhythmically challenging and elaborate as those tunes are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/gmBYdPECGkw?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I managed to find this player, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Xiao&quot;&gt;Wang Xiao &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who played on the album. I basically told her, “These are the notes, but do what you want with it. Make it sound like your instrument.” Just in a couple of takes straight and it sounded like, “Finally, this is the first time I’ve heard in this seven years since I originally composed the piece, it’s the first time I’ve heard that part the way I imagined it by an actual erhu player playing it with all that kind of phrasing and delicacy of ornamentation and color and everything.” It was wonderful. Yeah, so that was a big part of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Having Amir be able to record acoustic instruments so well was essential. The other thing was trying to make it all balance as well. That was the challenge for later on: editing it all and trying to make all the instruments sit together because they’re all recorded individually. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;There’s no ensemble playing on the album, even though it sounds like it.&lt;/span&gt; There’s a lot of hours of editing and comping and mixing to make it sound approachable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Having Amir there as my other pair of ears, he would say, “Okay, this doesn’t make any sense here. I’m not quite sure what this part is meant to do.” And so he’d always be–if it made sense to him, then I know it’s working. If everything’s balanced correctly and not sounding too dense, kind of like obscuring everything. Because it’s so densely orchestrated music, it could easily sound like a mess. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Having him there and make sense of it all was essential, really.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: I have to say it is a real work of art. It is not just a simple album. I don’t have ears attuned to all the various dialects of music particularly across Asia or a lot of where your influences seem to come, but to my western ear, I just thought about–between my western ears and my own sensibilities as a person who makes music, just thinking you had to learn all about these instruments. You had to learn how they sound and how they function. You had to learn how to orchestrate music to use those instruments and make an arrangement–you had to notate it so that you could have 20 different people playing on it. I mean, what an extraordinary work of art. It’s not like normal classical music where you can just hire this ensemble. I mean, you’re pulling influences from so many different areas, even if you went to India, or went to China, or Japan, or something, you wouldn’t be able to find the ensemble to play it. It’s such a homogenization of musical culture and sounds. So, it’s a real work of art and just the level of understanding that–and the journey you must have taken to be able to put it together–to me, is astounding. So, thank you for doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: Thank you. That really means a lot. In terms of understanding about all these instruments, it’s just years of being a listener as well. When I was a teenager, I’d just be buying albums of Chinese music and Arabic music and Indian music and just listening and by ear being able to understand how these instruments work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I was lucky enough to be taught orchestration as part of my music degree and I was really lucky because, in the place where I went (London Center of Contemporary Music), there were teachers there who could teach all these principles of orchestration and arrangement and things and that was totally necessary. And also, later on when I was at SOAS, even though it is oriental music and I was also doing some courses in Indian and Middle Eastern and everything, there was a little composition module there that I was doing and the fellow who taught that module (his name is Alexander Knapp) encouraged us to just write stuff to take some of these influences and do something that’s yours. He’d listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;He’s a brilliant classical musician as well as knowing about Jewish music and Middle Eastern music and other things. So he’d hear this and say, “Yeah, this is really interesting and I really like it. Just do more.” It was that kind of environment in which I was able to finally coagulate all these ideas and realize that, “Yeah, this is a possible thing.” The instrumentation changes throughout the album as well. Each piece has a different orchestration, so if it were to be played by an ensemble, it’d have to be completely reorchestrated and reimagined for it to really work throughout a whole–which is part of the reason it’s not been played live yet. It’d just be… “How?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: And expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: That too, yeah. A guy can pull favors but there’s a limit to that. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;The thing about it being a work of art is kind of intentional&lt;/span&gt; because gradually, as I was coming to understand more about music and the reasons why I’m drawn to certain types of music (as well as other forms of media, like books or comics or graphic novels or films or whatever), &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I started to see them all as sharing certain ideals and intentions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/vw1Sv04YQS4?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;For example, a big influence on me as a creative person is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Moore&quot;&gt;Alan Moore &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the comic book writer who wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen&quot;&gt;Watchmen &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_for_Vendetta_(film)&quot;&gt;V for Vendetta &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, all this stuff. Just seeing him in interviews talking about art as being this catalyst for personal change and how as an artist &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;it’s your responsibility to change the consciousness of the person that you’re communicating with.&lt;/span&gt; It’s totally possible. It literally becomes a form of magic to create something which then has a transportative or transformative effect on another person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Like this series here was what catalyzed all these ideas. It’s called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promethea&quot;&gt;Promethea &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and it’s this really beautiful psychedelic comic book. It’s kind of like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Woman&quot;&gt;Wonder Woman &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;-ish superheroine character, but then it’s really an excuse for him to talk about these esoteric ideas. It’s really quite–[picks up a comic book] let’s find an appropriately psychedelic section. It’s got all this psychedelic art and the whole point of it is the imagination as a shared space that we can tap into as creative people and then we can draw from that and use that language to communicate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Reading about that made me examine what I want to do as a musician and why I like the music I do&lt;/span&gt;, or at least a lot of it. Those are the things which connect lots of different types of music that you wouldn’t necessarily draw together. It’s a cliche, but it’s why people in the 60s were drawn towards Indian classical music because it is very much a kind of devotional music, it’s a spiritual music that’s intended to transcend ordinary consciousness. It’s the same with the jazz I listen to, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Coltrane&quot;&gt;Alice Coltrane &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Coltrane&quot;&gt;John Coltrane &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and Miles Davis, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharoah_Sanders&quot;&gt;Pharoah Sanders &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, all these people. You start seeing all these connections and then also looking into things like dreams, the unconscious, and how our minds work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Artists like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lynch&quot;&gt;David Lynch &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for instance. There’s a big–the new stuff I’m writing, there’s a big influence, not necessarily musically but creatively, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Peaks&quot;&gt;Twin Peaks &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a TV show that a lot of people know, but at its heart it’s about the relationship between the material world and the immaterial world where things exist and things that don’t exist and how the things that don’t exist can have a very serious, very real effect on the things that do exist. Thinking about mythology and symbolism and how art and music can represent certain things and induce certain states. That was all stuff I was thinking about all the way through the writing of the album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;There are references all the way along to things and people like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Blake&quot;&gt;William Blake &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. There are several tunes which even the titles, like “The Earth’s Answer” and “Fearful Symmetry,” directly taken from William Blake. In fact &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;the title of the album itself is a kind of compound of two of Blake’s ideas: the divine image and the human abstract.&lt;/span&gt; So, it’s a combination of those two ideas. He’s another character that recurs in my thinking about what I’m trying to do in terms of things I create because he had these, throughout the time, sort of visionary and unusual ideas about his own Christianity. He reversed a lot of the religious iconography at the time in order to communicate these quite visionary ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Similar things I can investigate in other cultures, like–I’ve got a few things here. So, William Blake’s “Songs of Innocence and the Experience,” that’s where those titles are taken from. And then the one that really had an effect on me was “The Marriage of Heaven and Hell.” Sort of this glare on that. And reading that was–but then reading things like this, which is “The Secret of the Golden Flower,” which I came across a few years ago and it’s like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daoist_meditation&quot;&gt;Daoist meditation &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; manual, but it’s all about, through meditation and through certain practices, you can ascend to higher states of consciousness. You can sort of become a new person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/v3hQXQ5_zCM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Also things like Joseph Campbell’s writing about mythology, like the hero’s journey. That played a big part in shaping the album, the track listing of the album. Where it begins and the arc in which it goes and where it ends. Like the last track, “Apotheosis,” the title comes from his ideas about the hero’s journey, how you’re taken out from your ordinary existence and you’re forced through all these trials and situations that change you into a new person. You take on all these new abilities and new powers, as it were, and then you overcome the parts of yourself that you want to get rid of. So you become a new thing at the end of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;There are little symbols and messages like that written into certain parts of the album that probably not many people have picked up on yet. I know they’re there. Like, the very last chord you hear, the cyclic thing you hear at the end of the last tune is largely in C lydian and it goes around that for a good couple of minutes. Across that, you hear the woodwinds do all these different melodies that go across each other and all happening at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Those are all themes from across the album I’ve taken out and they all exist in this shared space. They’ve kind of transcended their own time and exist in this shared moment. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;And then right at the end of that, it resolves and modulates up a whole step to D lydian, which is where the album starts.&lt;/span&gt; The very first chord you hear is in a D lydian. I wanted it to be a bit more obvious, like with maybe the tune from the beginning coming back at the end, but it just didn’t seem to work, so it’s kind of there in a very subtle way, but probably not in a way that it’d be really noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: That’s awesome. That’s a really cool way of introducing all the cyclic aspects of life and these stories that you’ve brought in. Even in the artwork, it’s very–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: I couldn’t be happier with the artwork. That was a very late development on the album because the original image I wanted to use, I didn’t have access to because the artist wasn’t available. I had that as a planned image for quite a while and then it turned out that that wasn’t going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, it just so happens that through Knifeworld and going to these more proggy gigs around London, I knew &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Buckingham&quot;&gt;Mark Buckingham &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; who’s a big, big fan of unusual music. He also happens to be an artist for Marvel and DC comics. He’s worked with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gaiman&quot;&gt;Neil Gaiman &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and all these things. Brilliant artist. He was the artist on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fables_(comics)&quot;&gt;Fables &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is a well-known fantasy comic that ran for quite some time. It was really popular. I got to know him at gigs and we’d chat about comics and music and things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;He said at one gig, “Well, let me know if you ever need anything.” At the time, I still had this other image in mind for the cover. I said, “Okay, maybe next time.” Maybe I could ask him some other time. But it turned out that the original plan fell through and I just sent him a really panicked message saying, “I know you’re busy, but can you do something.” He said, “I’m busy but I’ll…” Yeah, the first pencil sketch, I had to make some changes to it, which felt pretty weird telling this really amazing comic artist. “Well, maybe we can make some changes.” It felt kind of odd. But then the second sketch was perfect and that’s pretty much what you see on the cover. He turned it into a really beautiful black and white, sort of art deco ink drawing and it was colored in later on with some adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I couldn’t be happier with it because he really listened through the album a few times and looked at all the song titles and made a lot of effort to integrate all those ideas into the mandala on the cover. It’s got elements from all the different tracks on there. It’s one of those real fortuitous things because I wasn’t planning that until quite late. It was about two months before it came out. Less than two months before it came out when we actually had the artwork. It was right at the last minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/p5jt_8Tzu7s?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Is the music idiomatic to the performers and their instruments or did they have to spend time trying to understand what you were after?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: Everything was orchestrated, so no one came up with their own parts, necessarily. Some of them made alterations to certain things, maybe in the piano parts. Certain voicings needed to be more pianistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: I mean, because you’re blending different types of music, you might have had someone on the erhu playing something that might have been more of an Arabic type melody or something like that. Did you run into any of those kinds of situations or did you really just place the instrument where it was most appropriate?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: Oh yeah, definitely. I wrote for the instruments, so I made sure that the tunes that, say, the erhu played were the sort of thing you would imagine in who might play. It wasn’t taking it too far from its original context. In that way, it can play in its own way. It can be played and add their own.. It’s not something that’s unfamiliar. The only things that were unusual were the counting and–in the tunes, there’s all kinds of odd time signatures and hemiola and all kinds of stuff going on. That’s the thing that makes it not melodically that complex, but the rhythmic placement of it is quite unusual and definitely not the sort of thing you would encounter if you were a professional erhu player, unless you’re doing really “out there” contemporary music. Most of the time, it’s not really a thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Right. So I have some simpler questions that are more about being a musician. Doesn’t mean the answers are simple, though. [Laughs.] First of all, how many instruments do you play?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: I kind of lose count. I think it’s about 15 at varying levels. There are some that I’ve been playing for a long time and some I’ve just picked up and learned on the spot, put on records and things. It’s about 15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: And how many do you own?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: Uhh… [Thinking.] Somewhere around that. Fifteen, maybe. I’ve got two electric guitars, the Les Paul and the Jazzmaster. A classical guitar, acoustic guitar, a sitar, the oud, the saz, acoustic bass, electric bass, I’ve got a Fender 6 that’s on there. There are some that are borrowed, like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammered_dulcimer&quot;&gt;hammered dulcimer &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that I use–not on the album, but it’s all over the Mediaeval Baebes album. It’s been used on a couple of things. That’s borrowed. And a couple of the other things are, like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zither&quot;&gt;zither &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I borrowed. There’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harp&quot;&gt;lap harp &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I borrowed for the Mediaeval Baebes album that is borrowed. Other than that, I lose count.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: [Laughs.] Okay, and…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: Too much mental occupancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Can you talk a little bit about the instruments in the room with you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: Oh yeah, sure. I’ll introduce you to a few of them. The newest one I have, which I’m really excited about is this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: What is that called?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: This is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsugaru-jamisen&quot;&gt;tsugaru shamisen &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a Japanese, three-stringed lute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: That looks like the instrument that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kongar-ol_Ondar&quot;&gt;Kongar-Ol [Ondar] &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I think his name is. He plays with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9la_Fleck&quot;&gt;Béla Fleck &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and he does the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuvan_throat_singing&quot;&gt;Tuvan throat singing &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: Oh right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: It looks like that’s the same instrument that he plays. A two- or three-stringed thing that he just strums and plays some simple chords on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/MgN_xIHqLUA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: Might not be the same one, but the shamisen came from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanxian&quot;&gt;sanxien &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is a Chinese instrument. It traveled over to Japan a couple hundred years ago. It’s slightly different. It’s got a sort of snakeskin body. There are other central Asian instruments that the sanxien is related to. Basically, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road&quot;&gt;Silk Road &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is where a lot of these instruments traveled. There are probably relatives in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuva&quot;&gt;Tuva &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolia&quot;&gt;Mongolia &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and various places. The shamisen came into being when the sanxien moved over to Japan via &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okinawa_Island&quot;&gt;Okinawa &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and it fell into the hands of musicians who played the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biwa&quot;&gt;biwa &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is another Japanese lute instrument, which is played with this massive plectrum. I don’t play that yet, but at some point. So that’s why the shamisen is played with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Is that flat?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Okay, interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: Yeah, it’s called a bachi. Originally, the skin was snakeskin and it changed to dogskin. This is synthetic. I’m a vegetarian, so that’s kind of preferred. The instrument itself is used in all kinds of forms. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabuki&quot;&gt;Kabuki theater &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, storytelling, chamber ensemble music, but tsugaru shamisen happened around the late 19th century. So, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edo_period&quot;&gt;edo period &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of Japan and mainly played by destitute blind musicians. It’s almost kind of a blues music. The style is a lot more aggressive and it fell out of favor for a long time and then over the course of the 20th century, people started becoming more interested in it. It’s really a cold, brash style. You hold your plectrum like this and your plectrum travels through the string and into the body, like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Ah, I can’t see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: Like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Oh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: Can you hear that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Uh-huh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: Yeah, you’re gonna hear that. It’s quite loud. It’s got this kind of percussive effect. It’s become really popular with young people in Japan over the past couple of decades. It’s become fused with other types of music. These two players called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshida_Brothers&quot;&gt;Yoshida Brothers &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who are kind of rock stars in Japan. They’re a duo playing this. I first saw it when I was about 16. There was a concert in London of the best player of this instrument, a guy called &lt;a href=&quot;https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinichi_Kinoshita&quot;&gt;Shinichi Kinoshita &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and it was amazing. I’d never heard any Japanese music before. It was totally my introduction to a lot of East Asian music. It was just wonderful. The traditional pieces were great and he played his own compositions. It was a real life-changing concert. I wanted to learn it, but there was no one playing it in London at that time, so that sort of fell by the wayside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Then a few years ago, this fellow moved to London called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hibikishamisen.com/&quot;&gt;Hibiki Ichikawa &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm far fa-external-link&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who is the only professional player in the UK, currently. He was actually on the soundtrack of this film called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubo_and_the_Two_Strings&quot;&gt;Kubo and the Two Strings &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which came out a couple of years ago. It was a stop-motion animated film. He’s on the soundtrack of that. We actually did a gig together a few years ago and I thought, “Okay, I can get some lessons from him sometime.” Only recently, I’ve thought, “Okay, I need to do this.” I’m teaching him Western music theory and he’s teaching me shamisen. It’s three strings, fretless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/SxsbKlKkCJg?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Can you give a very brief sample of what you might play on that instrument?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: Yeah, sure. Remember, I’ve only been playing this for about a month. [Plays shamisen.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: That’s cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: It’s all that kind of stuff. It’s great. It’s really fun to get to grips with because you’ve got this wide vibrato and the sliding and it’s very improvisational, which is unusual for Japanese music. So, there’s that. I’m looking forward to learn more of that. In terms of stuff that’s on the album, there’s this and this is the pipa that I mentioned earlier. This is Chinese. This is actually related to the biwa, which is the Japanese lute. The biwa came from this and it dates back to the 8th century. It’s got a long history and it’s old, hundreds and hundreds of years. It’s got four strings. There’s your decoration on the thing there. And you’ve got a dragon carved on the back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Oh wow, what a beautiful instrument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: Yeah, it’s all rosewood, which is lovely. What’s unusual about it, it’s played vertically, like this. You can see all the frets are raised off the body, like that. It’s played vertically and the fingerstyle technique is really weird. Your nails are going into the string like this. It’s the opposite of fingerstyle guitars. So it’s–[plays the pipa]. That’s your basic sort of sound. There’s also the really characteristic technique. The instrument uses a really fast five-finger &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tremolo&quot;&gt;tremolo &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which starts with the index finger all going into the sort of strings like this. So it’s all five fingers. [Plays the pipa.] The reason why the frets are so high is because the instrument uses all sorts of bends and decorative techniques. It’s really versatile because of all the different sounds you can get from the instrument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: It’s beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: It’s lovely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: What’s around your fingers on your left hand?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: Oh this is for the shamisen, actually. This is the fingerguard for the neck of the shamisen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Ah. To protect it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: Yeah because you’re gliding along the neck all the time. This is just to help reduce friction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: And protect your skin, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: That too. The shamisen strings are this yellowish color because they’re dyed with turmeric. Notice these tiny blood stains starting to appear on the strings. It’s because I’ve been working hard enough. So, that’s great. The pipa is really useful for–I’ve been able to use it in all kinds of situations. I actually played this a few years ago in a performance of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Glass&quot;&gt;Philip Glass &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; opera called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sound_of_a_Voice&quot;&gt;Sound of a Voice &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is a chamber opera based on Japanese ghost stories. They use this instrument because it’s tuned to a chromatic scale. It’s got very wide range, quite diverse tonally. So it’s pipa, flute, cello, and percussion with two voices. I was asked to play in that because I was a professional player of the instrument, which is unusual in this country, and I can read all the notation. It can be used in all kinds of situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/7SBZrEHSbSE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: That’s cool. And that other instrument?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: Oh, and this one here, that’s the massive one. That’s called a &lt;strong&gt;daruan&lt;/strong&gt;. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruan&quot;&gt;ruan &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a family of Chinese stringed instruments that’s actually older than the pipa. It kind of disappeared for centuries and wasn’t reconstituted until the 20th century where it was redesigned and turned into sections, like a string sections. I also play the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhongruan&quot;&gt;zhongruan &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is the tenor one. There are smaller ones, but this is the one I thought I’d show you, because this one is the massive bass one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Ah!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: It’s really fun. I started playing this a few years ago and my teacher–I was transcribing a tune for acoustic guitar. A piece for this instrument because it’s in D A D A. Makes a deep sound. I transcribed it for guitar and she said, “Why don’t you just play on the actual thing?” And she just handed me this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: [Laughs.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: The performance of that was a week later. I had a week to get to grips with it and perform the piece of bass. It’s really unlike a lot of other Chinese instruments. It’s got this deep quality. [Plays the daruan.] So it’s got that real boomy, slightly brutal quality to it, which is great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: It’s funny. When it’s on the stand, it looks maybe as wide as an acoustic guitar, but then when it’s in front of your body, it looks like it’s bigger than your torso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: It’s a perspective thing. It’s great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: That’s very cool. All right, so, how do you make a living? London is one of the most expensive cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: It really is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: In the world. And you live there, and you play all of these strange instruments, playing pretty much not-mainstream music. So how does that work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: Well, I have played mainstream music before, but I don’t talk about that as much. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Making a living as a musician in London is practically impossible&lt;/span&gt;. It’s a really difficult thing and a lot of people either have to give up or just stop. Most of all, they have to bolster their income with other professions. Someone might just have a full-time job, maybe, or they might just–I know pretty well-known musicians who, during the day, will do painting and decorating work and then make weird music with the rest of their time. It’s pretty normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/6DbJQhu_YGk?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I’m lucky because I don’t have a family to look after. I don’t have children or anything, so that’s something that a lot of my friends have to deal with. I’ve been quite lucky with the breadth of experience I’ve had in terms of studying classical music and playing classical guitar and learning theory and things, being able to read, has been quite an important thing. The ability to read music well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;A lot of it’s teaching as well. I’ve been a guitar teacher for just over a decade, which has its own rewards and frustrations. It can be brilliant as well. I’ve got one student at the moment who’s about 11 years old and he’s just passed his grade 3 classical exam. All he wants to talk about when I get to his class is the anime series he’s watching. “Don’t start because I will talk to you about this.” It can be really fun, but I also–teaching evening courses and even though all the instruments I play might not necessarily be used for mainstream music, very few people are playing them on any sort of professional level, so I have the advantage of being “the guy that people can come” if they need someone like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Hence why I was asked to join Mediaeval Baebes. Kavus was the previous instrumentalist and then when he joined &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gong_(band)&quot;&gt;Gong &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, he didn’t really have the time anymore, so he asked me to join. It seemed like a logical thing because I play all these things. So then you can get session work doing that. Things like the Philip Glass opera. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I’m pretty much one of two or three people who could have done that&lt;/span&gt; because the combination of playing the instrument well enough and being able to read pages and pages of classical notation is quite a niche skill. So I’m able to get by with that thing. Also just being competent enough to play bass and guitar in any situation that might be useful, though I have gone through periods of doing other things as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I was actually on TV once. It was on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Morning_(TV_programme)&quot;&gt;This Morning &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is a real mainstream breakfast show. I was playing bass for a country duo, these two twin sisters. The only reason I got the gig was because I was friends with their manager and he saw a picture of me on Facebook playing bass and a hat on the stage with Knifeworld. He was like, “Oh yeah, looks really good. Bass and a hat. Fancy some television work?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: “Bring the hat!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: Yeah. I didn’t wear it on TV. It was too much for TV. And that was a thing I got to do once and was paid to do it by the manager and we signed a release form to use their image. Then ITV sent me a check a couple of weeks later for the same amount, so the occasional weird things like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: So that’s a big hodge-podge of gigs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: Oh totally. Just real corporate things where you’ll be playing in the corner and no one in the room is listening. Those are often the best paying gigs you’ll ever do. But, then that facilitates everything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: You do get by and you have a place in London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: More or less, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: And you’re doing it, so that’s awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: Yeah, there are certain–it’s that thing of having to work constantly. It’s never quite settled so I always have to be active, but it’s just being lucky enough to know lots of people in London and being able to exist in all these different worlds in London and know the guys in the weird, funny music. The proggy scene and knowing people who do traditional ethnic stuff and–it’s just sort of putting yourself out there. If people know you and they like you and you do good enough work, on time, and are reliable, that counts for a lot. Some strange things have come along as a result. Bands paying me to go with them to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antwerp&quot;&gt;Antwerp &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to shoot music videos because they like the ideas I did on their record. It’s just strange things like that. It’s a hodge-podge. It’s fairly scattered and variegated, but it’s just the way things are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/8PX5KKQqN-c?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: It’s what it takes. Okay, and then–I do have to get back to work, but I do want to talk about–you have talked about the stress, anxiety, and depression around finishing The Divine Abstract, at least on Facebook. And this morning, I believe it was this morning, you posted something about returning to that era. Working through certain things in your newest composition work. Can you talk about that era, what led to it, and how you’re working through it now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: Yeah, so I came to terms with the fact that I suffer from depression about four years ago, four and a half years ago. Around then, around 2014. Before that, I’d probably gone through periods of anxiety before. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I knew I had friends with depression, but I could never quite relate to it. It never seemed like something that could happen to me.&lt;/span&gt; It was always like this other thing. And then finally I had to be honest with myself and say, “This is what I’m going through.” It’s a combination of things: general existential crisis and, who knows, maybe a certain amount of psychological stuff from the past, perhaps. A combination of things. The stresses of being a freelance musician in London and the crises you go through with that. Relationships and things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Do you get discouraged about your music as well? “Not enough people care about it” or “Why am I doing this weird, esoteric things?” Does that get to you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Oh, of course. All the time. I think that’s quite common amongst people who do what we do. It’s the thing you have to live with.&lt;/span&gt; Maybe what you do will appeal to a certain number of people and might not necessarily have much value outside of this sphere that you operate in. It’s a shared thing amongst friends of mine and people I work with. The main thing was being open and honest about it. It got to the point where I just had to start talking about it with friends and be open about it on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;What happens then is that you start being contacted by people who you didn’t know were going through the same thing. They’ll tell you privately and it creates this deep connection with other people, I’ve found, being open this way. Maybe what was happening before was I was trying to be guarded. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;You start realizing that the version of yourself that you present to other people is often just that. It’s a construction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;What happens with depression is that the illusion is then dissipated. You don’t have that image of yourself anymore. It kind of destroys that image of yourself because you realize that it’s possible for you to be brought down to such a level. It can happen to you. You start assessing all different things about your personality and how it manifests in relationships or day-to-day things or in life in general. So it’s this thing you have to face. You have to go through it. You have to face these things. Often quite uncomfortable things about yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s a long period of being honest and open with the people around me and therapy and trying to create and trying to keep myself busy with music as well and remain active. And yet, it’s a real liminal state, this real transitory thing where after all you almost start seeing it as a positive because the person you become when you have to deal with all these things is so much better than the one that existed when you first started going through it. More open, more empathetic, more able to express emotions and things like that in language with other people. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;That can only help your creative work as well because if you’re closed off emotionally in your everyday life or you try and hide certain things about yourself then that’s only going to come out in what you write, I think.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Then I also had this relationship with the music I was writing, the music that ended up becoming The Divine Abstract. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;It almost became a way of writing myself out of these states, so it’s not necessary that I be depressed and write depressing music because it’s a means of wallowing in it. It’s almost a means of escaping it.&lt;/span&gt; You’re trying to create an ideal state for myself, like a world in which I could exist that brought me back to not necessarily normality, but beyond that, above that. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Trying to aim for the best aspects of myself. I think you can do that with music.&lt;/span&gt; When I was talking earlier about things like magic, it’s just manipulating symbols and sounds to create these things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/FmrIZzmYc_A?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It informed my approach to harmony as well, in terms of harmonic shifts. It’s what you’ve changed in harmony, about what they’re doing. You can create these changes in color and these changes of mood and these changes of mental state through the manipulation of harmony. You can create agitated, manic states through the manipulation of rhythm through hemiola or time signatures or polyrhythms. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;You can create musical depictions of these kinds of states.&lt;/span&gt; It’s kind of what I approach with the music on the album, it became this liminal thing. This thing that you pass through to become a new person, as it were, a new entity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;The music I’m writing currently, which is going to be the next album, is similar but different to the music on The Divine Abstract. It was all written in the space of about two months in terms of the original demos. At first it was this manic period and that broke, and then it became a real depression, like a really bad period of depression. It was that same period of depression that led me to finally be honest with myself and then make the music that’s on the album. But I’ll finish the music that’s on the album that’s just come out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So the process of working on this music now, a year and a half later, to a certain extent takes you back to that time, to that period. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;It reminds you of the space that you’re in, but it would feel creatively dishonest if I didn’t do that, if I didn’t face it and then go through the cathartic process of turning that into something, which is that alchemical process of turning a leaden consciousness into a golden one.&lt;/span&gt; Taking these negative states and then channeling into something that is positive, that not necessarily sounds like it’s coming from a place of depression because I wouldn’t necessarily want it to sound like it did, but has come through it and has expressed these states and created something from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Well thank you so much for sharing all of that. That’s very insightful and vulnerable, so I appreciate that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: Thanks, yeah. It’s wonderful to talk to you about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Thank you. So, finally, for people who want to learn more about you and your music, what do you suggest they do and how can they best support you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/2ZEq1RIyqKw?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: The album is on Bandcamp, &lt;a href=&quot;https://charliecawood.bandcamp.com&quot;&gt;charliecawood.bandcamp.com &lt;i class=&quot;fab fa-bandcamp&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I’m &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.com/charliecawoodmusic&quot;&gt;also on Facebook &lt;i class=&quot;fab fa-facebook&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and I’ve got the musician page on Facebook, which I use to update about exclusively musical things. I do &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/charliecawood&quot;&gt;Twitter &lt;i class=&quot;fab fa-twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://instagram.com/charliecawood&quot;&gt;Instagram &lt;i class=&quot;fab fa-instagram&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. There’s also &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Cawood&quot;&gt;the wikipedia page &lt;i class=&quot;fab fa-wikipedia-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; now, which is a real fun thing to have. That’s actually fairly well sourced and it’s pretty much accurate, so there is that. Working on a website currently, that’s something that’s going to happen. Other things that are happening soon is new Knifeworld at some point. There will be the follow-up to the current album that I’m currently working on, which is going to come out hopefully in a year’s time, maybe a bit more than a year’s time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;The last part of this year, there’s the new Mediaeval Baebes album, which I co-arranged and played about twelve albums on it. It’s a compendium of nursery rhymes and children’s songs, done in this partially beautiful and partially horrifically discordant way. For what’s essentially a pop-classical project, it’s probably one of the most avant garde things I’ve ever worked on. It’s brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;There’s a new band that’s going to come into existence online soon called Lost Crowns. There’s an album in production with that. That’s almost like a supergroup of our little group of musicians in London. I’m on bass and the music is written by a fellow called Richard Larcombe, who’s one half of this really brilliant band called Stars in Battledress with his brother James. Josh [Perl] from Knifeworld on keyboards, Rhodri Marsden from Prescott on keyboards. It’s this real collection of far-out musicians. And the music is totally psychedelic and singular and strange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I’m really looking forward to people hearing that one because it doesn’t really sound like anything else. It sounds like the sort of music for Stars in Battledress, but done with a full band. So there’s all sorts of stuff happening in the next year. New Matrix in Spirit, which is a sort of Balinese gamelan mixed with electronica and psychedelia and other stuff. That’s on the go as well, so that will hopefully be coming out next year. There’s all kinds of things. I tend to update everything on my social medias and my Facebooks and that kind of thing. There’s that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Okay, cool. Thank you so much for joining us. I do want to say there are two Charlie Cawoods, same spelling…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: Very different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yes, extremely different music. So if you do search for Charlie Cawood, make sure you’re getting this guy and not the singer/songwriter acoustic guitar player. If you want to listen to that, go for it, but that’s not this Charlie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: Yeah, it’s pretty much diametrically opposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah, pretty diametrically…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: It’s a fair distinction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: You’ll know when you’re listening to this Charlie Cawood when you hear all the instrumentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: You might prefer the other one. Oh this is really good! This is much better than that instrumental stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Although, anyone who’s gotten this far in this video is probably interested in what you’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: Or experiencing slight cognitive dissonance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: All right. Charlie, thank you again so much. I really appreciate you spending the time with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CC: Thank you. Real pleasure talking to you finally.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Animal Lover by The Residents</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;video&quot;&gt;Video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(NOTE: hitting the “play” button requires a hefty download of the entire audio file!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;audio src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/audio.makeweirdmusic.com/share/the-residents/animal-lover.mp3&quot; controls=&quot;&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;animal-lover&quot;&gt;Animal Lover&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first video in a series called “Jaw Droppers” where I’ll feature albums that have literally made me lose track of time until I suddenly realize I’ve been sitting slack-jawed while listening for 20 minutes or more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first album I want to feature is “Animal Lover” by The Residents. This album has had a profound impact on me. It is absolutely not for the light-hearted listener. It’s like listening to your worst nightmare. This is not an exaggeration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ad&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buy “Animal Lover” as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/animal-lover/1204944563&quot;&gt;digital download on iTunes&lt;/a&gt;. Check it out!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I distinctly remember being at my desk at work and listening to an online stream of the album back when it came out in 2004. I had just gotten out of a meeting that ended at around 2PM and I started listening. About 40 minutes later, I awoke from a trance. The music and its absolute strangeness completely captivated me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It starts with a song called “On the Way to Oklahoma” that describes a man who becomes a cat, falls in love with a tiger, and then eats a dog. The vocals are highly digitized, harmonized, and oddly melodic. This song was so stunning that I decided to have a music listening party with several friends just so I could play it for them. My friends jokingly referenced the lyrics for years after that night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next song, “Olive and Gray” is truly terrifying. It seems to be about a man who indecently exposes himself and then gets stoned to death. It is an incredible piece of music, too. Very complex, lots of dreamy instrumentation, tons of dissonance, and a cacophonous choir. This is one of the scariest songs I’ve ever heard. It literally makes me tear up in fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guitarist Nolan Cook absolutely shines on this record. Molly Harvey’s vocals are haunting. The orchestration is beautifully arranged and performed. It’s a very musical and melodic album with almost-timeless production qualities. The recording quality is top-notch, too, which isn’t a standard feature on all Residents albums. But make no mistake, each song is like an assault on one or more of the senses. It’s truly bizarre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ad&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/interview/homer-flynn&quot;&gt;Watch our interview with Homer Flynn&lt;/a&gt; of the Cryptic Corporation, the Residents’ personal and business managers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And let’s not forget the artwork! It’s definitely not safe for work and it’s barely safe for private consumption. The lyric booklet in this 2-disc special edition is just gorgeous, although it’s definitely a product of its time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this to say that it’s one of my favorite albums of all time and definitely my favorite Residents album. It holds a special place in my life for reasons I probably don’t even want to think about.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Halloween Baptizm by Shawn Persinger is Prester John</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;halloween-baptizm&quot;&gt;Halloween Baptizm&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halloween Baptizm&lt;/em&gt; is a very unique acoustic guitar album in various respects. First, the songs are written and arranged for four guitars and are played by Shawn Persinger:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Taylor 6-string acoustic guitar&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Taylor 12-string acoustic guitar&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Taylor 6-string nylon guitar&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.taylorguitars.com/guitars/acoustic/gs-mini-e-bass&quot;&gt;Taylor 4-string GS mini bass &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fas fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As he mentions in the interview, these guitars perform the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SATB&quot;&gt;standard SATB ensemble&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ad&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This amazing CD is available for just $5 as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://presterjohnmusic.bandcamp.com/album/halloween-baptizm&quot;&gt;digital download on Bandcamp&lt;/a&gt;. Check it out!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shawn messaged me on Facebook back in April 2015 and we loosely stayed in touch until December 2017 when I got his sampler package. Wow! It was such a beautiful collection of amazing content. Two books, a poster, and a CD! I can barely get interview videos posted (hah)! Anyway, it was obvious Shawn had put an unusual amount of care into this project and I wanted to do it justice. As soon as I started listening, I was astonished and knew we had to feature him on the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also got to meet up in person at the NAMM show, which was great. We met at the &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/julie-slick&quot;&gt;Julie Slick&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;/discover/marco-machera&quot;&gt;Marco Machera&lt;/a&gt; show, of all places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several months later, here we are! I hope you enjoy this very conversational interview. Shawn is an extremely intelligent and well-spoken musician and educator. I’m sure you’ll get some great nuggets out of this interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;video&quot;&gt;Video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/E1UjtIBWHgI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;transcription&quot;&gt;Transcription&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Shawn Persinger, also known as Prester John, is an acoustic guitarist and a very versatile musician based in Connecticut, teaches at the University of New Haven, and has released a new album called Halloween Baptizm. Well it’s new in the last few months. It didn’t just come out, but I’m a few months late to getting to this. [Laughs.] Nevertheless, Shawn thank you so much for joining us today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: Oh well thanks for having me today. I’m happy to be here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Awesome. So when I got your package in the mail, I just could not believe the amount of effort that you have put into this project. So, can you tell us a little about what you sent over and the kind of effort that you’d been putting into it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: Sure. From the get-go, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;the project was designed to be music text and visual. The visuals are very important to me.&lt;/span&gt; I wanted to have that classic 1970s album cover artwork that you could look at it at depth and you could turn it over. Granted, it’s still CD-sized, but we did a tri-fold tryptic and that was always important to me from the beginning because I wanted the music to relate to the visual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And then I wasn’t going to delude myself into thinking that contemporary audiences were going to try to find every little detail on the album covers, so I thought I would do a commentary for the album. That’s why I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/NOBODY-KNOWS-FAMOUS-Shawn-Persinger/dp/1548645559&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nobody Knows I’m Famous&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, to both talk about the production of the music, the hidden Easter eggs, the allusions that are in the music and the artwork, and also about being a musician in the 21st century in general because that was another thing that I found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;The circles I run in–you probably come across this, too. It happened a lot at the NAMM show. Having these discussions with your peers that you never really feel people talk about in print or in interviews about the–basically, the hustle. The hustle of always trying to get a new gig or trying to get a new writing job or trying to get a new performance opportunity. That aspect of being a professional musician, I think, is not–it seems like it’s not being discussed in contemporary circles online in a really frank and honest way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It was very important to me when I read &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Bruford&quot;&gt;Bill Bruford&lt;/a&gt;’s autobiography and &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Bill Bruford tells this story of playing a gig and they walk in and the manager of the venue says, “You guys gotta be done and off the stage at 10 because there’s a DJ coming in.”&lt;/span&gt; It’s Bill Bruford! He just writes, “This is the way it is. This is what happens when you play a certain type of music.” I feel like a lot of people don’t talk about that. Or if they do talk about it, they’re bitter or maybe they do tell it in a funny, embarrassed way as opposed to, “Well, this is just a part of the job–it is work.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah, so Halloween Baptizm–first of all, you play five different guitar parts. Correct?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: Four. Four different guitar parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/m9nA0k5hC6U?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Okay. It’s a very layered, rich, dense album. I’ve heard influences from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Frith&quot;&gt;Fred Frith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Kaiser_(musician)&quot;&gt;Henry Kaiser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/frank-zappa&quot;&gt;Frank Zappa&lt;/a&gt; and just so many different influences. There’s jazz, there’s kinda quirky humorous kind of music. It’s all over the board. And you’ve released all of the music in this notation book, which is really awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: Yeah, that was–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah, you covered a little bit on the commentary for the album. Can you talk about the music first and then the project of the notation and how they’re intertwined and all that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: Yes. So originally, most of this music was composed many years ago and &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I wrote it for registers. The idea was that any instrumentation could play this music.&lt;/span&gt; Basically, your bass, baritone, tenor, and soprano. A flute could play the highest part and a bass guitar or a tuba–the music was designed that any combination of instruments, or traditional string quartet, or a woodwind quartet, could play these pieces. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;That’s why there’s not a lot of chords. Even though it’s a guitar record, I was trying to avoid guitar tendencies.&lt;/span&gt; And even with that, I think there’s maybe four bends. I play four bends on the record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, it had all been notated years ago and then I finally had the opportunity to record it myself. That’s why I ended up using the guitars, but I also wanted to do a non-traditional guitar quartet. It’s nylon string, 6-string steel string, 12-string, and–thank goodness that Taylor Guitars put out this little mini bass last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: I can’t see. It’s not in view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: It’s this little GS mini bass, which I sort of hedged my bets on. I talk about it in the book. It’s this little parlor-sized guitar, but it’s got a huge sound. On the record, it’s massive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah, actually it sounds fantastic. And I think I saw you have an entry–because the book’s kind of in a diary format–where you get it and you’re really excited and it’s really cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: Oh my God. Because it could have come and I could have gone, “Oh my God, I just spent six months waiting”–I was really waiting. And I talk about waiting and procrastinating, like maybe I was just, “Eh, I’ll get to it eventually.” I was waiting for that bass and as soon as it came, it’s like the whole record came together because originally, you can see it back here too, that’s my 8-string baritone. I thought I would end up recording the bass parts on the baritone guitar, but that had limitations, too. The biggest of which is it’s tuned down a 4th from the other guitars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Would you mind pulling that off and just going through each string?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: Sure. Sure. So, let’s see here. When I strum an E chord…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Oh, wow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: You hear a B chord. And I was writing music for this instrument as well because this guitar is really great. When I talked to Bob Taylor, I said, “Who did you make that guitar for? It’s a really weird guitar.” And without missing a beat, he said, “For old guys who can’t sing &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creedence_Clearwater_Revival&quot;&gt;CCR&lt;/a&gt; in the original key anymore but don’t want to transpose it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: That’s awesome. I remember when that guitar came out and I thought, “I really want one of those because I bet it sounds really interesting. It’d be a great instrument.” I never would have thought “CCR.” [Laughs.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: Right! Because all of a sudden you strum, and you know–&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortunate_Son&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortunate Son&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lodi_(Creedence_Clearwater_Revival_song)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lodi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. John Fogerty’s a really great singer. The guy’s hitting high notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/yLKSc-pzcxA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: You don’t want to have to sing that C, so you strum a G chord in the original key, you’re singing your G. It’s a lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Oh that’s so cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: To a certain degree, and I say this with all due respect because I absolutely love this instrument, this instrument is really difficult to do much more on than just strum chords because as soon as you try to solo, it gets–the octave strings in the middle throw you off. These strings are so heavy it’s hard to play traditionally. You’re trying to play fast. So when I got it, I realized, “Oh I could write music for this. I could do like what composers did”–I forget what century it is. When the piano finally came to fruition and people who had been composing harpsichord music said, “Oh we can do other things with the piano.” And the shift in composition changes. And I thought, “Well I can do that with this.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Unfortunately, it’s not like the 8-string baritone usurped the 6-string steel string. So the audience for writing music like that is relatively limited and I talk about this in the book. As it turns out, the quartet even as esoteric as that is, there’s a broader audience for both the music itself and for playing it because most people do have access to any sort of 6-string guitar, bass, and for the most part, a 12-string guitar. 12-strings are not that uncommon either. So that’s why the quartet is the instrumentation that it is. It’s because I wanted to be diverse and I wanted to be able to exploit the tonal characteristics–the difference between a nylon string and a 12-string, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: So tell us about the–if you want to put the guitar back, that’s fine. [Laughs.] Can you tell us about what inspired you to write this music? Because it’s not what people might think. It’s not like an easy-listening kind of &lt;a href=&quot;/interview/california-guitar-trio&quot;&gt;California Guitar Trio&lt;/a&gt; kind of thing where it’s sometimes experimental. It’s kind of the opposite. It’s very experimental all the way through. Extremely musical, but it definitely touches a lot of edges or boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: Yeah, I think this ends up just being my personal taste in music. I shouldn’t say my personal taste, because my taste is extremely broad. I like pop music and I listen to tons of pop music. I play in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Browne&quot;&gt;Jackson Browne&lt;/a&gt; tribute band, so it’s not like these things are one or the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: But for me as a composer, I’m always–I hope this doesn’t sound arrogant because I think it’s very hard to do new things–but I thought, “At the very least, the instrumentation is unique and &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I can do this balance that I’ve always tried to strike of the weird and the commercial&lt;/span&gt;.” It drove me nuts that you’d get these 12-tone composers and not only were they trying to do a serial composition, but they’re also doing this outrageously rhythmically complex music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not entirely true, but I always thought, “Well, if I can use all 12 notes, I’ll keep my rhythms a little more simple. And if I’m going to do really complex rhythmic music, I’ll keep the melodies pretty simple.” So, like number 8 on the album, not that it’s outrageously complex–I think number 10 as well–those are pretty rhythmically complex, but they’re all completely tonal. Almost 100% diatonic and then a piece like number 7 on the album is outrageously rhythmically complex. Probably the hardest thing I’ve ever had to record. It’s really tough and it’s short. It’s only two pages of music. I think it’s 38 seconds long, but it’s really, really tough. But it’s all completely diatonic. Oh, I was kind of drifting myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Another piece would be something like–I’m trying to think of something that has a lot of different notes, but the rhythms are pretty straight ahead. Maybe I don’t do that as much as I think I do. And again, you know this because you make weird music, these things are all relative. What is weird to Joe Average is pretty normal to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: So, something that I think, “Oh that’s normal,” somebody else looks and goes, “That’s–I can’t. I don’t even have a point of reference for it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Right. For perhaps progressive rock listeners, whatever progressive rock is, I kept finding myself thinking, “Wow, this is like &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/gentle-giant&quot;&gt;Gentle Giant&lt;/a&gt; meets &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/king-crimson&quot;&gt;Robert Fripp&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Craft&quot;&gt;League of Crafty Guitarists&lt;/a&gt; meets Frank Zappa’s symphonic work arranged for acoustic guitar.” There’s so many wonderful influences. I just love the album, but yeah it’s definitely not a “normal” acoustic guitar album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/lPLMqqqRzuc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: Well, that’s the other thing. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;The acoustic guitar world tends to be pretty–the most diplomatic way I can say it is “safe.” It’s relatively safe.&lt;/span&gt; The other influence I want to mention because I didn’t mention it too much in the book is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Parker&quot;&gt;Charlie Parker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dizzy_Gillespie&quot;&gt;Dizzie Gillespie&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I got obsessed with their melodies. Their solos? I don’t need their solos at all. In fact, I’ve got recordings where I’ve just chopped off the heads.&lt;/span&gt; The beginning and the ending because I like to hear them play together in unison or in harmony. And those outrageously complex melodies. That’s a big influence for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It was a big influence for my electric band, &lt;a href=&quot;http://cuneiformrecords.com/bandshtml/boud.html&quot;&gt;Boud Deun&lt;/a&gt;. The violinist and I would always either play in harmony or in unison so that it didn’t just sound like, “Oh here’s a guy playing fancy.” It was, “Here’s a guy playing fancy and another guy who’s keeping up with him.” And that’s all Charlie Parker and Dizzie Gillespie. The other influences, Zappa, &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/captain-beefheart&quot;&gt;[Captain] Beefheart&lt;/a&gt;, Fripp, yeah those are all part of what I do. When I left the band–when the band Boud Deun broke up, I was trying to figure out, “How can I play the music of Boud Deun on acoustic guitar? One acoustic guitar?” Because that band was Frank Zappa and King Crimson and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahavishnu_Orchestra&quot;&gt;Mahivishnu&lt;/a&gt;. Those were some of the biggest influences. And punk rock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_Threat&quot;&gt;Minor Threat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minutemen_(band)&quot;&gt;The Minutemen&lt;/a&gt; were big influences for me and that band as well. And how could I play that on acoustic guitar? Because for the most part, no one seemed to be doing that. If you look at the weirdest &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fahey_(musician)&quot;&gt;[John] Fahey&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Kottke&quot;&gt;[Leo] Kottke&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.richardleojohnson.com/&quot;&gt;Richard Leo Johnson&lt;/a&gt;. Do you know Richard Leo Johnson?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/uk85fl41gLY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: I’ve never heard of him. No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: He put out this brilliant record on Blue Note years ago called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.allmusic.com/album/fingertip-ship-mw0000049293&quot;&gt;Fingertip Ship&lt;/a&gt;, which is really stunning. You should check it out and have a listen. That was–He’s ten times the virtuoso–I should rephrase it. He’s ten times the player that I am. I’m just trying to stay modest here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: [Laughs.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: But that complexity–he did it. But not a lot of other people do that in acoustic guitar world. Every now and then, you’ll hear people who are weirdos, like a &lt;a href=&quot;/interview/mike-keneally&quot;&gt;Mike Keneally&lt;/a&gt; will do an acoustic track. He did that one acoustic album, but even that one acoustic album is relatively normal for Mike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: For Mike, yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: Mike is a great example of the guy who balances all those things. He gives you a pop–I remember seeing him years ago. He came out and he would do a straight ahead rock song and then he would do something outrageously weird and then he did a song that had a jam in it where he could solo a lá &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimi_Hendrix&quot;&gt;[Jimi] Hendrix&lt;/a&gt; and he just kept repeating that. Like, “Here’s my pop song, here’s the weird, here’s the jam.” I thought, “That’s the way to do it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah. All right, so musically the album is incredibly interesting. The notation is just fascinating to go through, but the book itself, Nobody Knows I’m Famous. It’s right here, this white book. It’s such a comprehensive journal of all things musical. You’ve got family stuff in there. You talk about instruments. You talk about modesty. You talk about everything. I couldn’t believe it. I was like, “This is more of a memoir,” and then the fact that you came out with all of this at the same time–how did you plan all of that? I mean, that’s a monumental effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: Yeah, I got lucky in a couple of ways that–I put out this guitar book called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/50-Greatest-Guitar-Books/dp/1619272458&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 50 Greatest Guitar Books&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It was five years ago, which ended up being a very successful book. Delightfully because everybody I talked to said, “Yeah that sounds like a magazine article.” “That sounds like a blog.” “You don’t want to write a book about other guitar books.” It turned out to be highly successful and I’ve sold more books than I have records, really, in the last five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So I realized, “Oh there’s a link here of I can do the music and the book.” Because I do enjoy the writing. I write for Taylor Guitars magazine and again, with all due respect to Taylor, Taylor lets me do a lot of weird stuff for a relatively commercial mainstream audience and they have readers who they love what I write and they don’t like what I play. I thought, “Well wouldn’t it be interesting if I can write to them so that they could have an entree into the weird weird music.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Because &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I have no illusions that what I do is weird and not necessarily accessible to your average listener.&lt;/span&gt; And I thought, “Well that would be nice if I could not explain myself, but let people know…” I don’t know if this is true for you. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I think there are a lot of weird guitar players, weird musicians. They have no interest in the mainstream. They’re willfully antagonistic towards them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/5NnNpx0R7hQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Well when we met, we met at NAMM right after you’d hung out with Henry Kaiser, who is the exact epitome of what you’re talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: Yeah, to a certain degree, though Henry embraces–I mean he’s a huge &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead&quot;&gt;Grateful Dead&lt;/a&gt; fan…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah, he embraces everything, but he’s not known for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: Right. He’s not interested in selling records to a mainstream audience. A mainstream audience does not fall into his purview. Is that the right word?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: There’s a couple–I remember &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Zorn&quot;&gt;John Zorn&lt;/a&gt; and reading an interview with him. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;He would hang up flyers after the show.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: [Laughs.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mn9Z4VrK5K0?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: That’s so punk. And I love that, but it’s not who I am. I don’t find myself angry and resentful in my personal life, but as a professional as a musician, I really do want to reach a wider audience and maybe expose people to things. There’s a lot of music–aggressive, weird music that I understand why people don’t like it. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Not everybody has to like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magma_(band)&quot;&gt;Magma&lt;/a&gt;. It’s an acquired taste.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But if I can figure out a way without compromise to my music to invite a broader audience to come investigate some of this weird music–Again, Frank Zappa is a perfect example. You pick up the wrong Frank Zappa record when you’re 20, you’re never going to listen to another Frank Zappa record, which is a pity because &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;you could listen to 20 different records and not hear the same music.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/1eGgXa360-E?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Right. And I love that there’s an entry in the book about how much should an artist make. And you specifically talk about Frank Zappa and the variety of output. Can you go a little further into that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: Yeah, so for me, what Frank’s 62 albums? 58 or 62?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Actually I think–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: In his lifetime. Since there’s been like 30-something come out?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Well, I think the new album they put out was his 100th last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: I can’t remember what it’s called. [&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Me_This&quot;&gt;Dance Me This&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: I’ve listened to almost all of them. I haven’t bought all of them. I’ve borrowed them from friends, I’ve listened to them online, that sort of thing. And I kept finding I would get frustrated. I thought, “Well how come &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheik_Yerbouti&quot;&gt;Sheik Yerbouti&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t sound like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roxy_%26_Elsewhere&quot;&gt;Roxy &amp;amp; Elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;? How come &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Them_or_Us&quot;&gt;Them Or Us&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t sound like Roxy &amp;amp; Elsewhere? How come &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolutely_Free&quot;&gt;Absolutely Free&lt;/a&gt; isn’t as a good–I’m sorry, I’ve got it backwards. Absolutely Free is one of my favorites. How come &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We%27re_Only_in_It_for_the_Money&quot;&gt;We’re Only In It For The Money&lt;/a&gt; isn’t as good as Absolutely Free even though it seems to be the same ideas and environment?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Meat&quot;&gt;Uncle Meat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Rats&quot;&gt;Hot Rats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: Yeah, Uncle Meat is unlistenable to me. I just don’t want to listen to that record ever! &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;But Absolutely Free? I think it’s one of the top 10 greatest albums ever made. It completely changes rock and roll forever.&lt;/span&gt; You know, there’s these legends that people always talk about when &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles&quot;&gt;The Beatles&lt;/a&gt; were making &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sgt._Pepper%27s_Lonely_Hearts_Club_Band&quot;&gt;Sgt. Pepper&lt;/a&gt;. They’d say, “Sgt. Pepper is our &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet_Sounds&quot;&gt;Pet Sounds&lt;/a&gt;.” Well, supposedly more frequently, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_McCartney&quot;&gt;[Paul] McCartney&lt;/a&gt; said, “Sgt. Pepper is our &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freak_Out!&quot;&gt;Freak Out&lt;/a&gt;.” But that doesn’t get reported as much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So those records are really important to me and I, as I say in the book, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;you don’t have to like everything an artist does. You don’t even have to like the artist as a person!&lt;/span&gt; They do XYZ in their career and you gravitate towards that and it’s completely valid for them being a fantastic artist whether they do a higher percentage of work that you’re not interested in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah, you have a lot to say about a lot of topics and I really appreciated that about the book. I didn’t get to read the whole thing, maybe–I skimmed through a lot and read maybe half of the whole book, but man there–every time I would…something would catch my eye as I was reading and I thought, “You could write a whole book about this.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: You absolutely could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: This book is, like, full of books. So, can you talk a little about your–you’re clearly academically, well that’s your profession as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: Well, it’s actually not. I mean, I teach at the University of New Haven, but I’m an adjunct lecturer. My real education–I went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musicians_Institute&quot;&gt;Musician’s Institute&lt;/a&gt; in Los Angeles, which was a great school, but it’s basically a trade school. For me, it was rock and roll, even though the curriculum was mostly jazz. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Almost all of my composition skills come from listening to records and looking at scores.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I have no compositional training. My notation is pretty bad. I notate in Finale and Finale plays back the music and I go, “Oh that’s not what I thought it’d sound like. I gotta change that.” And all of a sudden I find–This was years ago. I’m slightly exaggerating. I’d write this piece of music with these triplets and I’d write in the triplets. It’s a triplet. And I’d listen back and it’s like, “That’s not what I want!” It would take me hours and I was like, “Oh, it’s two 16th notes followed by an 8th note. Duh-duh-duh-DUH.” Not “DA-da-da.” And those are things still to this day! I’ll notate them and go, “That’s–oh shoot! I meant this.” And thank goodness for Finale to play it back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/0kJhE0U0I28?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Right. Yeah. But your background is–I know you’re a schooled musician, but you go so far beyond the musical elements and I think you said in your notation book, “You don’t know how much information you don’t need until you learn everything about music theory.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: The music theory, yeah. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;You need to know a lot of music theory to know how much music theory you don’t need to know.&lt;/span&gt; That’s one of my favorite–one of my lines. It’s so true because there’s so much complexity, music terminology. There’s three terms for the exact same thing and the terms seem to contradict each other. Bringing that aspect–like you said, though, about the book. There’s these entries that could be other books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;A big one for me in that book was the harming power of music. I thought, “This is a book I wanna write, because &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;why does music make me angry? Why, when I hear a song, do I get frustrated?&lt;/span&gt;” Because people talk all the time about the healing power. “When you listen to music, it activates every part of your brain.” Is this true for you? I know it’s not–here’s the other thing. There’s so many things that I think about that I’ve never heard anyone talk about, but I’m not arrogant–I’m just not arrogant enough to think that I’m the only one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So I wrote this book so that people go, “Yeah, I think that too!” But I’ve never seen anybody talk about it. Why does–and I’ll say it here because I think I took it out of the book–why does &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celine_Dion&quot;&gt;Celine Dion&lt;/a&gt; make me so angry? I mean, from the get-go. Why do those pan flutes from Peru… I just want to go crazy. There’s a tone. There’s something in the overtone series. There’s something in the tonality that makes me cringe!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah it’s funny. My wife and I saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._Carlos_Nakai&quot;&gt;R. Carlos Nakai&lt;/a&gt;, who’s a Native American flute player and there were times where I thought, “Oh this is really beautiful,” and there were other times I thought, “This is the cheesiest music I’ve ever heard.” What is it about the Native American flute that can either be really peaceful or extremely cheesy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: Right. And it’s not like I’ve listened to a lot of it. Back in the 1980s, there was the pan flute master, I forget–&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gheorghe_Zamfir&quot;&gt;[Gheorge] Zamfir&lt;/a&gt;. There was those commercials and I remember busking in Europe years ago. I had this great busking spot and my battery ran out of power. I had to run down the street. I was in Denmark and I had to run down the street, buy a new battery, and when I come back, these Peruvians in this traditional dress had taken my spot. I was so angry. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I’m not angry because of that, because they took my spot. It was the music itself that was really frustrating me.&lt;/span&gt; And so I thought, “Somebody must have done this.” So first I tried to get in touch with the guy who wrote “Your Brain on Music.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Oh yeah. Elliot Sacks?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/7NgJpw4qvug?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: Uh, not Sacks because he’s passed away. He’s from Montreal, but he specifically says on his website, “Don’t contact me about XYZ interviews.” He’s a busy guy. I totally get it. So, I contacted another person who I thought might know somebody and I ended up talking to this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/research/researchers/zatorre&quot;&gt;Robert Zatorre&lt;/a&gt;, who’s a neuroscientist/neurologist. Neuroscientist, I think, at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGill_University&quot;&gt;McGill University&lt;/a&gt; and he was great because he took time to talk to me. I said, “How come it makes me angry?” He said, “It’s a great question. No one’s done a study on it. People don’t want to know those sorts of things.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;There’s not funding to make people angry in an MRI machine by playing them either Celine Dion or Metallica, whoever you don’t happen to like. He said, “What you could do is you could put somebody in an MRI, play them a type of music and see them irritated. You can actually see them irritated in their brain, but we don’t know why that’s irritating.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: So, have you come to any personal conclusions? Perhaps about Celine Dion? [Laughs.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: Part of me thinks it’s tonality, like its timbre and tonality. It’s like Latin music. I remember–I grew up in DC and we had–outside of DC, Washington DC. And you’d have these Latin radio stations, especially on the Sunday morning or Saturday, and it always drove me nuts. I couldn’t stand that music and I’d turn it off. I was playing a gig years later, we were playing upstairs and a Latin band was downstairs and they were amazing. It was like, “Oh my God, this is–this is the real deal!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And I realized Latin music doesn’t translate to vinyl record. It doesn’t translate to coming out of a little speaker in your car. You have to be in the room to hear everything working together and I think this is true of a lot of music that’s old. Right? You go to see a big band for the first time, it’s very different than when you hear it on a record and I think that something squashes sounds and overtones so that when you have them in one context, they don’t work in another context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I think maybe I’m actually literally being irritated by the sound of the way the frequencies and the overtones–again, I’ve never studied this. I don’t know how you would begin to study that. If somebody out there does, I’d be happy to get an MRI and they could play those songs. I could tell you exactly what songs and what artists bug me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: It’s funny, I’m the same way about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Harris&quot;&gt;Sam Harris&lt;/a&gt; podcast. Not it’s not Sam Harris that bothers me because I like a lot of what he says, but listening to his–the recorded voice irritates me. I’ve heard people say, “Oh you’re so surface.” I see other people complaining about it, too, but I’m like, “No, there is something wrong with the way his voice is recorded and mixed and whatever compression he’s using.” It removes all the sibilance so you can’t even hear–you can’t distinguish an ‘s’ from a ‘t’ from a ‘b’ and then it removes his breath! It’s like it’s not a human speaking. Just the way it’s recorded, I have such a hard time listening to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: See, I think that’s the easy place to start. Maybe you just need to start with just a recording engineer. If you add more reverb to a thing, all of a sudden it doesn’t sound as good, but just the right amount of reverb makes something pop. That’s even a better example. You’re in a vaccum. It sounds horrible. You put too much reverb on, it sounds worse. You put just the right amount of reverb, all of a sudden, it sounds like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresh_Air&quot;&gt;Fresh Air with Terry Gross&lt;/a&gt;. It’s perfect. It’s exactly what you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah. What is it that makes listening to NPR so much more pleasing than listening to the Sam Harris podcast? I don’t know, but I do know that NPR has an engineer that has a very specific sound, electric flow. Everything is intentional. The microphone, the compression, everything, to get that sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: Yeah. Intentional to a point. I’ll tell you–I think the station is still out there in LA. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KXLU&quot;&gt;KXLU&lt;/a&gt;, that was the radio station. I loved the station. In the early 90s, played a lot of punk rock, a lot of really weird stuff. I could just call up and say, “Hey would you play XYZ?” and two songs later, it would be on the radio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;This is funny because it was just when &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smells_Like_Teen_Spirit&quot;&gt;Smells Like Teen Spirit&lt;/a&gt; had come out. It might not even have been out yet. It was about to be released. It was getting played on the big radio stations and KXLU. I literally called up and said, “Play that new Nirvana song.” And the DJ said, “Yeah, this song’s getting played on the bigger stations, too, and I have a cassette of Smells Like Teen Spirit played on KXLU and it never sounded better.” It is the best and it’s because the compressor or something, the antenna, the signal that came out of KXLU onto my boombox is the greatest sound ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: So yeah, I think you touched on something because I definitely agree there is music and recorded audio that can make you angry for arbitrary reasons, or what seems arbitrary. You’re not criticizing the content, there’s just something about what you’re hearing that makes you angry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: Yeah, the sibilance that you’re talking about. Is that how you pronounce it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: I think so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/LcQKjffxIOY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: The rough edges are cut off. That’s what Celine Dion–all the rough edges are cut off and everything is smoothed out. There’s an irony there because of course I don’t want rough edges in my house. I don’t want to get splinters. I don’t want my kids bumping their heads on coffee tables. And when you see a car, it’s smooth. It’s got curves. But somehow, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I don’t want that in my music. I like the rough edges.&lt;/span&gt; I think &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Inner_Mounting_Flame&quot;&gt;Inner Mounting Flame&lt;/a&gt; is far superior to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_Fire&quot;&gt;Birds of Fire&lt;/a&gt; because Birds of Fire is slick. They’ve got it. They’ve figured it out. Inner Mounting Flame, they are [slap] just go! It’s so rough!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Well, you listen to Captain Beefheart, it’s like pristine recording. You can hear–it doesn’t even sound like it was recorded on analog tape, the way it was mastered or something, because there’s so much treble, there’s so much bass. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat_Chain_Puller&quot;&gt;Bat Chain Puller&lt;/a&gt;, that song–it’s such a rich sonic experience, whereas you might listen to–I’ll listen to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jethro_Tull_(band)&quot;&gt;Jethro Tull&lt;/a&gt; album and I think, “The drums just sound so dead!” Even though &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barriemore_Barlow&quot;&gt;Barrimore Barlow&lt;/a&gt; is killing it. Double kick and everything, but it’s like, “Why could Captain Beefheart get such a great sounding album and then you hear–” or even &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_Theater&quot;&gt;Dream Theater&lt;/a&gt;, some albums I can’t even listen to. The singer, some people hate him, some people love him, but just because of the drum sound, I can’t listen to it. You know? It’s like, what is with Captain Beefheart? Why can he get such a great sound on his records and then something else in that same era sounds so horrible?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: I think I might have an answer for that. This is just me pontificating off the top of my head. Again, this is with all due respect to Beefheart because I’m a huge fan. It’s super important to me. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Beefheart is kind of one-dimensional. It’s not like you get a lot of different things from Beefheart on any individual album.&lt;/span&gt; Bat Chain Puller all sounds the same as opposed to Clear Spot or Spotlight Kid. Those are different records. They sound all the same and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trout_Mask_Replica&quot;&gt;Trout Mask&lt;/a&gt; all sounds the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: It does, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: Guitar, bass, and drums, and the vocals, as opposed to the Jethro Tull where you have to have that hi-hat, that kick drum, and the flute, and the guitar, and the bass, and the timbre of his voice, so there’s more–and you’ve got the ballads and you’ve got the songs that rock. And then the songs that do both. I think those are harder songs to mix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: There’s also–you listen to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Waits&quot;&gt;Tom Waits&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s like he only wants you to hear the rough edges whereas Celine Dion is absolutely the opposite. And yet, my wife might listen to Celine Dion and makes me, “Ugh! How can you listen to that?” And I listen to Tom Waits, and I’m like, “Oh it’s so gravel-y! Listen to the scratchiness of his voice, and that old piano, and the room and everything,” and she’s like, “How can you listen to that? It sounds like it was recorded in a barn and he’s some drunk old man yelling.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;That’s part of the great thing of life. Everybody’s different, everybody’s got a different taste.&lt;/span&gt; For me, I think it’s important to be able to recognize that hopefully you understand why your wife doesn’t like Tom Waits and your wife understands why you don’t like Celine Dion. Although, it seems like that one’s the harder one for people to figure out. “Why don’t you like things that are nice?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: [Laughs.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: It’s not that I don’t like it when it’s nice, I just don’t like it when it’s nice and it doesn’t seem sincere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah, I get that. I just think that’s such a great question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: Who am I to say what’s sincere? That’s the other thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: But your album, Halloween Baptizm, to bring us back to the reason we’re talking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y4A5wYUzXNM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: Yeah we should come talk about me. Isn’t that what we’re here for? &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Kerman&quot;&gt;Dave Kerman&lt;/a&gt;–Do you know Dave Kerman? He’s in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5uu%27s&quot;&gt;5uu’s&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UtoteM&quot;&gt;UtoteM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking_Plague&quot;&gt;Thinking Plague&lt;/a&gt;. Amazing, amazing drummer. He said–I forget who he was talking to–every interview, whatever he’s talking about, he just brings it back to the new product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: [Laughs.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: And he was a real weirdo artist because, “Oh yes, you want to talk about the color purple. Well, on my new album, I completely left the color purple out because…” Yes, Halloween Baptizm is the name of the new record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: [Laughs.] Yeah, when did you release it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: On Halloween!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: On Halloween!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: On Halloween of last year [2017], which I thought was–well, if the record is not that successful this year, I’ll just re-release it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: I can re-release it every single year on Halloween.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: What I love about it is, even though it’s called Halloween Baptizm and the art is very fall, you know, like the typical fall colors and that kind of thing–the artwork is beautiful, first of all. I love the artwork. But, the album–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: Which I didn’t make. I commissioned the artwork specifically from two artists. One was actually Maria Nickland, who was actually my first wife and the other it Gonzala Puentes, this Chilean–he’s from Chile. He’s a guitarist and illustrator. And both of them went above and beyond my expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: It’s wonderful!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: I specifically knew what I wanted from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: What I do want to get to is, even though it’s released on Halloween, even though it’s called Halloween Baptizm, even though it’s fall colors and this art kind of reminds you of this time of year, the music itself is timeless. It’s not like–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: It’s not creaky door, Halloween spooky sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: And I do want to at least emphasize that for anyone who might be listening. This is not a “Halloween” album and the album is just so musical and rich and interesting. And it’s the kind of thing where you can listen to it over and over again even in succession, it can be two or three listens in a row, because there’s something different that you’ll catch in every song. What I do appreciate is you do not over-polish anything. There are times where I can hear how hard it is to play that, just as a guitarist. And there are times where I can hear your hands on the instrument and you’re not trying to over-produce or make it fake. It’s like, here is me authentically performing this music, some of it is extremely challenging for me. So, I appreciate that and I think it’s a really great record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: That’s–I’m not sure if I wrote about this in the book, but it occurred to me years ago, one of my biggest limitations is physical. Technical. I’m good at certain things, but other things, I just can’t get up to speed. You’ve done that thing about &lt;a href=&quot;/learn/fracture&quot;&gt;Fracture&lt;/a&gt;, that impossible-to-play piece, which it is! And then, the way I came to terms with it is I realized my favorite players are really sloppy and sometimes my favorite things recorded are horrible. Again, with all due respect, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Coryell&quot;&gt;Larry Coryell&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairyland_(album)&quot;&gt;Live at Fairyland&lt;/a&gt;, I don’t know if you know that record. It’s got a song called Stones on that album. There are times when it sounds like he has no idea how to play the guitar. And it’s so beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/qMZBydsO7_c?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: [Laughs.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: It’s glorious. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Ribot&quot;&gt;Marc Ribot&lt;/a&gt;, his Saints album. Oh my God, it’s just full of what sounds like mistakes and you couldn’t play something better if you wanted to. John Fahey, he’ll do these things where you just think any second, he’s gonna just stop and go, “We’ll do it again” For me, I think, I love that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: I do, too. I saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Scofield&quot;&gt;John Scofield&lt;/a&gt; play with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Mehldau&quot;&gt;Brad Mehldau&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Guiliana&quot;&gt;Mark Giuliana&lt;/a&gt;. It was an awesome show and when I first saw it, I was like, “Wow, Scofield’s the weakest guy up there.” And then into the show, I’m like, “No this is his thing. This is how he plays,” and I began to appreciate it differently. He’s got that kind of messy thing going on and that’s cool. You know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I’m a huge fan of the mess. Huge fan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah, the mess is great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: And, hey, I like technical guys too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: Leo Kottke, the complete idol. Robert Fripp, I love that stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Emmanuel&quot;&gt;Tommy Emmanuel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: I appreciate Tommy, yeah, from the technique and the skill. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Rice&quot;&gt;Tony Rice&lt;/a&gt;. Huge Tony Rice fan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: I don’t know Tony Rice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/rVl1ibykWZU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: Tony Rice is a bluegrass guitar player. One of the most underrated guitar players. In bluegrass circles, everybody knows that Tony Rice is basically the greatest bluegrass guitar player of all time, but you never hear other people talk about Tony Rice. But Tony is immaculate and tasteful and what an amazing songwriter. If you check out his work with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Grisman&quot;&gt;David Grisman&lt;/a&gt; quintet and then his records, like Mar West or Back Waters. Great, sophisticated acoustic guitar music. It’s jazz-influenced and bluegrass-influenced, but never sounds like either. Very unique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: So for anyone looking to listen to this record or find out more about you, where should they go?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: You can go to PresterJohnMusic.com and if you want the Halloween stuff, you can specifically /halloween. But PresterJohnMusic will get you me, it’ll get you everything I’ve done. I was originally in a progressive rock band called Boud Deun, we put out a couple of records ourselves and on Cuneiform Records. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;That, to me, is still one of the greatest accomplishments of my life, to have records on Cuneiform.&lt;/span&gt; That band was Mahivishnu, King Crimson-esque.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And then I went solo and then I had a duo with a mandolinist named David Miller and now I’ve got this quartet. It’s all kind of the same idea. The way Frank [Zappa], if you really do delve into Zappa, even though he does a lot of different things, there’s always a thread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: The Project/Object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: Even if you don’t like it, you still know it’s Frank. I’ve tried to keep that. I think &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McLaughlin_(musician)&quot;&gt;John McLaughlin&lt;/a&gt; is like that, too. If you listen to the Extrapolation album, then Mahivishnu, then Shakti, you can hear those–he does those same ideas. It’s not that he’s just playing the same lick, it’s that there’s a conceptual idea running through those things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I think for me, conceptually, my idea is: how can I play weird music in song form? That’s a big thing for me. Most of my songs are kind of–some people would say A, B, A, B, but I’m inclined to say verse, chorus, verse, chorus, here’s the bridge, and if you’re willing to listen to the more complex music, you do go, “Oh, I do hear it. He’s repeating those little ideas.” In fact, Halloween is very much one big idea, melodic themes. I did write about that as much as I could in the book that there’s the intervals that I play correspond to the song number titles, or there’s some sort of theoretical idea in each of the songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah, I actually am reminded of a couple questions I wanted to ask. Tell us about, there’s a lot of kind of scientific influence and mathematic influence in the song titles. Can you go into that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/dhThfJPHJyQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: Yeah, so I had a friend who told me, “Well, I really love the record and then I read the song titles.” A couple of them are a handful. The second piece is called “One is the First &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Germain&quot;&gt;Sophie Germain&lt;/a&gt; Prime.” Oh, sorry, two! “Two is the First Sophie Germain Prime.” And that’s a tribute to this woman, Sophie Germain, who was a scientist and this is my very, very superficial way of paying tribute to science and innovation and the scientific method of trying to explore things and find things out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I didn’t want to just guess why music was making me angry, I wanted to go to a scientist who’d studied these things and find out if someone knew why. And that’s a theme that runs throughout the record. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;There’s a tribute to scientific ideas, mathematics because of the number idea. I don’t want to say I crammed in some mathematics, but there’s some mathematical things.&lt;/span&gt; I’m horrible at math. I’m awful. I’m bad at everything except playing the guitar, and some would argue. But really, and I’m not being–if it’s musical, I’m interested, I’m intrigued, but everything else I’m really horrible at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But I have an immense respect for people like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson&quot;&gt;Neil deGrasse Tyson&lt;/a&gt;, or one of my favorite podcasts is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Infinite_Monkey_Cage&quot;&gt;The Infinite Monkey Cage&lt;/a&gt;. I really like these scientific ideas and I like the idea, too, that scientists are willing to admit, “Well, we’re not 100% sure, but we think this is the way it is. When more information is available, we’ll reevaluate what we think.” I like that idea of scientific discovery with the guitar, with music in general. How can you–I like to start with inspiration. I’ve got a musical idea, I play it, it comes to me on the guitar, now how can I use the theory to develop it into something bigger? And how can I take all the people–the predecessors, because that’s the big thing. The long line behind me. That “standing on the shoulders of giants” cliche that I’m trying to build on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: And then, finally, tell us a little about the name “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prester_John&quot;&gt;Prester John&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: Oh yeah, that’s marketing. It’s totally commercial marketing, is all it is. Like Coca Cola. I was in this band, Boud Deun. It’s a horrible name for a band. It’s hard to spell. It’s hard to pronounce. Steve at Cuneiform still pronounces it wrong. “Bood DeON.” He says “Dion.” Celine Dion, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: He’s doing it just to rub you the wrong way. [Laughs.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: Joyce at Cuneiform calls us “The Boud Deuns.” So, when I went solo I realized Shawn Persinger, no one is going to buy that record. I’ll put on the Prester John tag because that’ll be marketing. At least they’ll remember “somebody is something.” And Prester John, the legend of Prester John, is that there was a letter that circulated through Europe 500 years ago proclaiming of this realm of Prester John.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s basically a Garden of Eden. Mythical animals, jewels in the mountains, everyone’s well-fed. It was a prank, a prank letter. People looking for this personified fountain of youth and found nothing. I like this idea that it’s historical and it was a joke, so that’s where the Prester John part came from. It’s nice, every now and then, I particularly like this when I’m with my kids. My kids are 7 and 9. We’ll be out and someone will be like, “Hey! Prester John.” It’s nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah, that’s pretty cool. Awesome. Well, thank you so much for your time, Shawn. It was really a very fun chat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/_6KlZc9sBKs?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: Thanks for having me. Oh, one more quick plug is &lt;a href=&quot;http://WeirdGuitarLessons.com&quot;&gt;WeirdGuitarLessons.com&lt;/a&gt;. How long have you had Make Weird Music?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: I think it’s since 2014, early 2014. Four years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: Okay, so we started almost parallel. I’ll have to go look. We both had the same idea at the same time. You were going to promote weird music in your way and I was going to do weird guitar lessons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: That’s awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: Look, if you go to my website, I’ve got a miniscule amount compared to you. I think there’s only 9 lessons in five years, but again, there seems to be–if you’re a real weirdo, a lot of people don’t talk about what they’re doing from a–this is an easy to grasp. Well, not necessarily an easy to grasp idea, but I can break it down and show you how I do these techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And again, that’s something I wanted to do because as an educator and as a kid who really learned to play guitar by listening to records and buying music books, I’ll send you–I’ve got a library in my other room. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I own literally thousands and thousands of guitar books. I’ve read them all. Almost none of them are weird.&lt;/span&gt; Thank goodness they put out a decent John McLaughlin book last year and they started doing the Zappa books. I’ve seen those. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Size_Fits_All_(Frank_Zappa_album)&quot;&gt;One Size Fits All&lt;/a&gt;, the impossible guitar parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yep. I have it right there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: I would give anything for a Trout Mask Replica book and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lick_My_Decals_Off,_Baby&quot;&gt;Lick My Decals Off&lt;/a&gt; book. A really good King Crimson book of Red, or I’d much rather have the box set, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Deceiver&quot;&gt;The Great Deceiver&lt;/a&gt; box set. Starless transcribed. I don’t know why Robert Fripp doesn’t sit down and do a real book of the old Crimson songs. That’s something I–maybe I’m rambling here, but I’m going to say this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;After I finished the 50 Greatest Guitar Books, what I really wanted to do was sit down with Larry Coryell and say, “Larry, show me this. Do this, do that.” Because I don’t think a lot of great players really know what’s great about what they do. Or some of them might even be, “Oh, you know I did that 30 years ago. I’m always moving forward.” “I’m sorry, I’ve got to know how to play it.” McLaughlin, I love this riff and I could tell you all the music theory behind it. [Plays “Meeting of the Spirits” riff from “The Inner Mounting Flame.”]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;That’s a life-changing piece of music. The first song on that first Mahivishnu record. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I want to sit down with John McLaughlin and say, “Let’s have a long, a really long conversation that I can turn into a really small book because we’re going to have to talk about 100 things to get the two that are the essence of what you do.”&lt;/span&gt; If I could sit down with McLaughlin or if I could have sat down with Zappa or Larry Coryell. I mean, Larry is one of my all-time favorites. Did so much great stuff. There’s a few other of those key players that you want to sit down and really digest what they do and be able to talk about it as peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;You can’t go in there as a fan. Like, “Oh, I love what you do. Isn’t this cool? And weren’t you good?” You can really say, “I don’t want to talk about this thing you want to talk about. I’ve got an agenda that I think I and lots of other people want to know about. Can we do that in a way that’s going to be helpful to other people who are sort of at a lack–how many blues guitar books do I need?” Not many, but I could use those other books I’m talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: I don’t know if you saw, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trey_Gunn&quot;&gt;Trey Gunn&lt;/a&gt; has just published an entire transcription of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrak&quot;&gt;Thrak&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: I did see that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah, and more is coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: All right, that’s good to know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah, so I think there is–this weird music thing, there seems to be–well, probably because the music industry has fallen apart so now you’ve got to figure out, “How do I make money when my music makes me basically nothing?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: Yeah and the notation–the other thing that’s really hard about that, right, is the notation. This is hard stuff to notate. Don’t get me wrong, there is this couple guys who do transcriptions for Hal Leonard. If you can do a Frank Zappa book, you can do a Dr. Nerve book, you can do a Boud Deun book, or a Mahivishnu book, or Captain Beefheart. I think there’s a reluctance on the bigger publishers and the original licensing publishers to say, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;“This is a lot of effort and we’re going to sell 20.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Right. [Laughs.] Yeah. Awesome. Thank you again, Shawn. It was really great talking to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;SP: Hey, thanks for having me. A real pleasure. I hope to see you again soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Growing Pains by Courtney Swain</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;growing-pains&quot;&gt;Growing Pains&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Growing Pains&lt;/em&gt; is a fantastic, beautiful, dark, intimate, exciting new EP from Courtney Swain. (If her name sounds familiar, it may be because &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/courtney-swain&quot;&gt;we interviewed her last year&lt;/a&gt;.) Each of the five tracks offers something new and beautiful. I absolutely love this record. It’s moved me to tears on multiple occasions and it’s a quick 24-minute listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ad&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s also available for just $5 as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://courtneyswain.bandcamp.com/album/growing-pains&quot;&gt;digital download on her Bandcamp page&lt;/a&gt;. Do yourself a favor and buy this record. This is art as music, folks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved it so much I asked Courtney to do a conversation about it shortly after I’d listened to it on repeat 8-10 times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;video&quot;&gt;Video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;transcription&quot;&gt;Transcription&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Courtney Swain is the singer of the band &lt;a href=&quot;http://bentkneemusic.com&quot;&gt;Bent Knee&lt;/a&gt;, a very interesting rock band based in Boston. Courtney and the band have just returned from a European tour. Courtney, how did all of that go?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CS: Oh, it was amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Awkward pause.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Okay!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Laughter.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CS: I wasn’t sure if you wanted me to say more! No, it was just amazing. That’s all I want to say. It was fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Laughter.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Awesome. And Courtney, you’ve got a relatively new solo album out called Growing Pains that I’m several months late to, but I don’t feel so bad because I know that you’ve mentioned before that there’s no press after an album is released, you know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CS: Right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah, so here we are. Tell us about the album Growing Pains, when did it come out, and tell us a little about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CS: Sure yeah. So, I put Growing Pains out in November of 2017 and it was something that–it was a collection of five songs that I was working on at the beginning of 2017. So right about a little over a year ago. And actually, literally last year at this time, I was doing a residency. I was awarded a grant to basically have two weeks to myself and I applied with this project where I wanted to write an album that was very much on my laptop and sort of an in-the-box kind of thing. I knew I was going to write a bunch of music there, so before I did that I wanted to get all of these piano songs in my head out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;The way I write, I tend to have sets of songs that are very much piano-centric and then I have songs that are way more beeps and bloops kind of I-wrote-it-on-my-laptop types of songs. Growing Pains is the piano songs and I took the album on my first solo tour in December–last December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/p91IkLPKgIw?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I, for some reason, had not realized that all the songs are kind of connected. They’re all growing pains of some sort and I was completely oblivious when I named the album Growing Pains. It’s just a line in one of the songs that I liked. But yes, it’s kind of a dark album, it’s kind of painful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;After I recorded it, I put it away for a while and I was so busy with the Bent Knee release for Land Animal that I didn’t listen to it at all. After about seven or eight months, after the studio date, I went back and listened to it and I listened to the songs in succession. When I got to the last song, I was just crying uncontrollably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s rare that I’ve had such a breakdown in my life like that. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;It really struck me how much the music meant to me. It seemed way too personal for it to be relevant to anybody else&lt;/span&gt;, so I hesitated in whether I should put it out or not, but I tried to stick with that gut feeling that I had that made me so emotional and I thought that there’s something to that that I wanted to share with the people who listen to my stuff. So yeah, that’s the story behind that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: I am so happy you did because–what an amazing piece of music. Every song that went by, I was like, “This is my favorite song on the album,” and then the next one was like, “Oh my goodness! This is even better than the last one!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CS: Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: And that last one–Prickly Rose, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CS: Prickly Thorn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Oh, Prickly Thorn–Oh my goodness. It’s, like, darkness, and the vocals and the string arrangements. It’s just incredible. What a body of work!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CS: Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: The fact that it’s only 24 minutes long is like–you just want to put it on again right away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CS: Awesome, awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah. It’s really great. So tell us about the string arrangements and the production of the album. I was really impressed beyond just your capabilities. The whole production, I think, is just a perfect piece of work. So, tell us about the production of it, the arrangements, and all that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CS: Well thank you, first of all. I really appreciate that. The production was masterminded yet again by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bentkneemusic.com/about/&quot;&gt;Vince Welch&lt;/a&gt;, who does all the Bent Knee stuff and so far has done most of my work, too. We found this wonderful studio in Lincoln, Rhode Island. We live in Providence, but Lincoln’s about 20 minutes away. We heard about it through friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;The guy who runs it is this wonderful person about our age. He’s just the most fun and patient engineer that I’ve ever worked with. His name is Brad. The space is really neat. It’s a huge room. It’s one of those repurposed warehouses, so the live room is massive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;There’s a couple different pianos there and when we showed up to record, Brad was really excited because he just had a bunch of his pianos tuned. I think we ended up using two different pianos on the album. There is an upright and then there is a grand. One of the funny stories was that we recorded it in January and the room being so big, in order to heat it, he had to turn on this big Reznor heating apparatus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Between takes, the temperature kind of dropped, so as the day progressed, the pianos would gradually go in and out of tune. A lot of times when I show up to a piano, people are like, “Oh my God, is the tuning okay?” &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I’m actually one to be really excited for pianos that are out of tune, unless they’re unplayable. But, I have a pretty broad palate in terms of quirkiness and tuning. So that was pretty exciting for me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;The string arrangements were something I worked on the previous few weeks before I came into that. The string players that we worked with were all our friends. Most of them have played on at least one or two Bent Knee albums as well and I brought them in because I wanted to work with sort of a female/femme energy. They were all sorts of women and so it was kind of fun being in the live room. We were just having a ball.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;A lot of times, I end up hanging out with a lot of guys in my profession, but &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;there is also something special to having an environment like that that’s filled with women.&lt;/span&gt; I can’t really explain it. But, yeah, I thought they just played their hearts and souls into it and it was really emotional the entire time we were tracking. We did most of it in one day, so I got there early and I did scratch–I did keeper piano takes and scratch vocals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Oops! Sorry my cat wants to say hi. “Hello everybody.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/6W8rvEAJILk?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;This was the first time I tracked the piano and the singing separately. I think originally we were talking about doing it together, but I was really interested in having a really intimate and really raw kind of vocal sound. When I’m playing piano while I’m singing, I tend to get carried away by the piano or I tend to compete with the loudness of the piano. I can’t get as quiet or intimate as I want to, so that was the idea behind that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I showed up early in the day, tracked the piano, did a scratch vocal take, and then the string players showed up around noon or 1 and they just played until 6 or 7. I think we mostly went in order of the songs. There’s only four of the five songs that have strings, so we just went in order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;At the end of the last song–all four of them have are really wonderful singers on top of wonderful instrumentalists and I think we were trying to explain or try to figure out how the parts were working or something. Then I realized, everybody was singing their parts and it just sounded gorgeous in this massive room, so I was like, “Wait, why don’t we just do that? Can we just have that at the end where we have this wonderful choir?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;That’s how the ending came together. I ended up having to go in for an extra half day to track vocals and the studio, the big nice studio. But that was it, so it was a very minimal production and then Vince did his magic and we had it mastered by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.berklee.edu/people/randy-roos&quot;&gt;Randy [Roos]&lt;/a&gt;, who again does a lot of our stuff. It’s kind of the same crew, different approach. But, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: I just absolutely love it and it’s such a, as you said, an intimate album. There were times where I was listening where I almost felt guilty listening, hearing too much about your life or something. I was like, “No, that’s exactly what this is about.” It’s a stunning release of emotions. The music just so perfectly supports it. I thought–I wanted to hear a little bit about how you wrote these songs because they don’t really follow the traditional structure, as far as I could tell at least. You’re not “verse chorus verse chorus bridge” happening in the album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CS: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Can you talk about how you explore songwriting and how these songs came to be from a compositional standpoint?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CS: Yeah, of course. I think these songs sort of came at the end of my maximalist writing interests. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Right now, I’m very interested in minimalist writing, by which I mean I am trying to get more out of the same chord progressions, but making that feel different by timbre and texture.&lt;/span&gt; For me, in my writing, which is the case for Growing Pains too, when I switch a section, I have to change the accompaniment completely too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But I’ve noticed that in a lot of music, people approach it a lot more economically. Even if the chords are the same, they can actually change the feel by adding different instruments or changing a texture or changing the vocal line. That’s what I’m interested in now, but at the time when I wrote Growing Pains, it was just sort of–I think it’s kind of almost a contemporary classical kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Prickly Thorn is the last song I wrote on the album. Again, the way the album is structured, there’s gradually more strings as the songs progress, and also the order of the songs are roughly in the order they were written, too. I listened to Joni Mitchell’s Blue really recently, I’m ashamed to admit. I was like, “Oh yeah. This is what I want to do.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I’ve listened to a fair amount of Joni Mitchell. I’m no Joni Mitchell expert, but actually a funny story. Bent Knee did a Halloween show once where we covered Joni Mitchell exclusively. I might have told you this. A Joni Mitchell Halloween. So, I know of her music and I love Hejira, so I think that was a big influence that I was pulling from for Growing Pains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Compositionally, yeah, I do like to stray away from the “verse chorus verse chorus” thing, but it’s not always a conscious thing.&lt;/span&gt; I think in my own writing, and also in Bent Knee, what’s happening is that we tend to have extended and very complicated bridge sections, so what you would call a C section–because it’s usually A B A B C B, right? Verse chorus verse chorus bridge chorus. The bridge is always complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;That’s the case in the first song, the second song also has a weird bridge, the third song also has a weird bridge, the fourth song is a little bit different. It’s just more of an extended chorus-y bridge. The fifth song, Prickly Thorn, is just–it’s craziness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I did a really cool session in Brooklyn where there’s a guy who has an old direct 2-mix to vinyl machine. You just play in the studio–actually it’s not even a 2-mix, it’s a mono. It’s a tiny room and he cuts it directly to a 7-inch, so if you want to make five 7-inches, you have to play the song five times. Every one is different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, we were prepping for the session, and I’d asked &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chrisbaummusic.com/&quot;&gt;Chris Baum&lt;/a&gt;, Bent Knee’s violin player, to play with me. We were talking about Prickly Thorn and I was trying to write down a form for him so that it would be easier to follow because we just had one rehearsal. Chris is just a genius at going with the flow in terms of improvising and playing his beautiful–so I was like, “Okay Chris, there’s A… B… A B C A… D.” I was just going, “Oh my God, this makes no sense. This is so not helpful.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/YNuoBoPL2Gw?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I don’t know how I ended up at that, but I remember sort of cutting sections and pasting sections and being, “Well this feels too long. This feels too short.” And it somehow ended up like that. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: So how was the touring experience? These vocal performances are really raw and very powerful. Was that an emotional experience for you? Did you go deeper in as you toured or did it become more casual, like “yeah I can do this?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CS: I think a little bit of both. It was kind of nice not to–to do a tour by myself. It affirmed something–a thought I’ve had for a long time about how taxing Bent Knee is on my voice because I can–if I’m singing by myself, I’m not competing with that much sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;When I’m on a Bent Knee tour, I don’t drink at night. I’m basically chugging water all day every day. On a solo tour, it was like, “Oh, I can have a drink once in a while!” It was really nice. But in terms of the delivery, I really loved doing that tour for a lot of reasons. I did it with my college freshman year roommate, who’s a singer-songwriter in LA. So, I kept joking about how, worst case this is just going to be a girl’s road trip and best case it’s going to be a couple of shows that are great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I had this, for me, really profound realization where I gained a lot of confidence in what I was doing. In the beginning I would go into these shows and I felt like I had something to prove.&lt;/span&gt; And before the tour, I had a couple of these shows and I would listen back to the audio and I would just feel kind of unsatisfied. I couldn’t understand why because in terms of the accuracy of the performance, it was good. The tempos were good, the notes were right, but it just didn’t feel quite right and I realized that I was leaning too far into it. I had to come out of it a little bit and let the music breathe and be myself instead of trying to push. I think it’s something that I’ve heard people talk about a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I took this really expensive vocal lesson a couple years ago because I was having a hard time managing my voice in certain rough sections of Bent Knee. The guy was like, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;“You have to create the sound of you going all in, but you can’t actually be going all in.”&lt;/span&gt; It was kind of like I finally understood what all that meant because when I did get really emotional, and when your brain is 100% AAAUUUGGGHHHH, I didn’t sound the way I wanted it to sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So I learned to sort of perform, draw this line in my performance where I saw it as this thing. It wasn’t less satisfying in any way. It was more satisfying, ultimately, because I knew I was coming across the right way. But I also learned a lot about stage presence and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;There’s not a lot of points in Bent Knee’s live set where we talk. We normally don’t really talk that much because we do seamless transitions between songs and we usually say hi once during the set, but I found out that that didn’t really work when it was just me and the piano and a solo set. I had to talk in between stuff and I realized that had this anxiety, or this nervousness that was selfish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I was ratcheting myself up to be anxious, so when I’d talk, I’d be like, “Umm, thank you for coming.” I’d talk really fast and really intense. I just realized, “This is not doing anybody a service. It’s not doing me a service. It’s not doing anybody who’s watching–to have fun.” &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;So I learned that I just have to be confident in that I have something to say that’s worth listening to.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I started talking slower and I started talking more at my normal talking volume. I realized it was just a way better way to communicate. So, I started introducing each song before I would play it because I found that when I would not introduce all the songs, when I would finish my set, people would come up to me and they would tell me that their favorite song was the one that I introduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It wasn’t always the same song. It was whatever song I introduced and I gave a background to, people seemed to enjoy it more. So I was like, “Okay, well, if that’s a thing, I should just do it for all my songs.” It was a real growing process for me where I had to commit to doing thing instead of–you know how when somebody’s really good at something, sometimes they’re bad at taking a compliment? I think I was that way for a really long time. This was something where I realized: me not being able to take that compliment was actually harming my art more than doing it a service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Have you heard of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome&quot;&gt;imposter syndrome&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CS: No. Oh yeah! I think my therapist told me about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah, yeah. That reminds me of that. It’s a real personal struggle that talented people have to overcome and I think what you’re talking about is basically that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CS: Yeah. It was a really amazing experience. Night after night, doing the same thing. It really makes you evaluate how you can do better, because otherwise it’s just not fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: So I sent the album to a friend of mine and he fell in love with it instantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CS: Oh, awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: He said, “She’s gotta know about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryuichi_Sakamoto&quot;&gt;Ryuichi Sakamoto&lt;/a&gt;.” Do you know him?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/LGs_vGt0MY8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CS: Yeah yeah yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Oh, okay. Does he have any sort of influence or bearing on what you do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CS: No! No, I know of him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Laughter.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CS: Only because I’m half Japanese, but I think in a way, probably. I’m working on this project where–well, I’ve had a couple of projects recently where I’ve been asked to introduce my tracks and what influenced me. They are completely obscure to a lot of western listeners because they’re basically J-pop tracks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So I think Ryuichi Sakamoto is a fixture in Japanese music, so I think a lot of J-pop and Japanese music that I was listening to growing up takes from that. I think I’m kind of in the line of his music, even if I don’t have a direct correlation to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Okay. And this summer, you and Bent Knee will be on tour. Can you share a little bit? Do a little Bent Knee promo?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CS: Yeah! So we’re going on the Paper Earth tour. We’re starting the last week of May, right after the week of Memorial Day. We’ll be going clockwise this year. We normally go counter-clockwise. So, all around America. I’m really excited this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/9u8HvvTaLNU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;We’re going out with this band called &lt;a href=&quot;https://gatherersband.bandcamp.com/&quot;&gt;Gatherers&lt;/a&gt;. They’re on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.equalvision.com/&quot;&gt;Equal Vision&lt;/a&gt; and they have a new album coming out that hasn’t been announced yet. They’re really, really fun folks. They stayed at my house once and I’m really good friends with the guitar player, Anthony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;This is our first summer where we’re doing our entire long-ass tour with other people. So, it’ll be interesting. I’m sure there will be real highs and real lows as there is to every long tour. We’re really excited. We’ve been writing some new music in the studio, so we might be playing some of that out and we also just premiered a piece that we wrote for Bent Knee and a percussion ensemble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;That half an hour sort-of-through-composed piece is called Paper Earth, which is where the name of the tour came from. We haven’t figured out if we’re going to play any of the snippets or the small song kind of things of Paper Earth as part of the tour. I think it’s quite possible that, yeah–every year we do this. It’s something I really look forward to in my life. I’m excited to go out on tour again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah, and you guys are coming to Phoenix in June. I actually rearranged my vacation schedule so I could make the show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CS: Ohhh, my gooooosh. Yessss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah, so we will be there and I’m super excited to finally see you guys live. So, that’ll be awesome. All right, for people who want to find out more and to support you in the best ways possible, can you share where to get that information and what they can do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CS: Yeah! I’m really easy to find online as well as is the band. I’m also starting a Patreon. I don’t know if I’ll have it booted by the time this interview comes out or not, but it’ll just be at &lt;a href=&quot;https://patreon.com/courtneyswain&quot;&gt;Patreon.com/CourtneySwain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tah5q89iNcg?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, that’s a place if you want where you can pledge a monthly amount and get access to, basically, my blog. That’s a short way of talking about it. I was having a conversation with Bent Knee’s guitar player, &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/ben-levin&quot;&gt;Ben [Levin]&lt;/a&gt;, last night. We were talking about how, for a long time, we’ve drawn this line between the band and us as people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;For example, Ben’s drawn this line between his incredibly successful YouTube channel and the band. For me, I’ve always felt like a “meh” moment when people call me “Courtney Swain of Bent Knee” instead of just “Courtney Swain.” We were sort of agreeing about how that’s not the point anymore and it’s just about all of us doing all of this together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So anyway, long story short, it would be a place for what I’m doing, but also a lot of my point of view of what we’re doing in Bent Knee. I’m hoping to talk about my keyboard parts in Bent Knee, the story behind the songs, whether it be Bent Knee stuff or my stuff. I’m going to do a book club where we’ll just be listening to an album every two weeks and we’ll hang out and talk about it. It’ll be kind of a fun place to hang out, if anybody’s interested. Otherwise, I’m also available at &lt;a href=&quot;http://courtneyswain.com&quot;&gt;CourtneySwain.com&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=&quot;http://bentkneemusic.com&quot;&gt;BentKneeMusic.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Do you have any physical copies of the Growing Pains album left?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CS: I do! Yeah, I have some left. I pressed them at a local letterpressing company, so they’re beautifully pressed. It’s a limited run. I always do limited runs for a lot of stuff, like a lot of the first edition Bent Knee stuff for the first and second album, we had limited runs. And I’m hoping one of these days that they’ll hold value and someday I will find out. I don’t know how many more years it’s gonna take, but I’m gonna hang onto those copies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Well, save me a couple. I’m definitely going to buy some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CS: I certainly will. I certainly will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Cool. Thank you so much, Courtney. I really appreciate you taking the time to talk about your music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CS: Thank you, Anthony. It’s always a pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Aaron Comess</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Aaron Comess is a genre-busting musician who plays in several bands, has a diverse catalog of solo albums, and has played on over 100 albums for dozens of different artists. His new album, &lt;em&gt;Sculptures&lt;/em&gt;, is a fantastic foray into electronic and ambient jazz. There’s tons of great rhythmic stuff going on throughout the album. There are some great melodies. There are pretty sections, goofy sections, ugly sections. The album has everything. Even my wife likes a bunch of it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interview-transcription&quot;&gt;Interview Transcription&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Aaron Comess is a drummer based in Brooklyn, New York and he is most notably known for his work with the rock band, the Spin Doctors, which have been active for how many years now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AC: Believe it or not, it’s gonna be 30 years this October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Oh my goodness, 30 years! And believe it or not, Turn It Upside Down by the Spin Doctors was the first CD I ever bought with my own money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AC: Well thank you very much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah, yeah! I fell in love with the album previous to that, I can’t remember the name right now. Krypto–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AC: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocket_Full_of_Kryptonite&quot;&gt;Pocket Full of Kryptonite&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/wsdy_rct6uo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Pocket Full of Kryptonite. Yeah. I listened to that over and over and over, so when I had money–I got that BMG membership. You know, the 10 CDs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AC: Oh yeah. That’s right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: So I got Turn It Upside Down. That was the one that I bought for $18 or something at the time. But anyway–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AC: That’s cool. That’s great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Enough about me! [Laughs.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AC: Well thank you. Thanks for buying it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah, sure. So, yeah, Aaron–why don’t you talk about what you’ve done, not only with the Spin Doctors, but you’ve had a long career. You’ve been playing drums as a musician for 30 years now–beyond 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AC: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: I’m sure most of us don’t know what you’re doing outside the Spin Doctors. So, let’s talk about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AC: Well, okay. There’s been a lot of different things over the years. I grew up in Dallas, Texas and I started out playing out of books like this, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/14-Modern-Contest-Solos-Snare/dp/0769228232&quot;&gt;rudimentary drumming&lt;/a&gt;. My first teachers taught me how to hold my sticks like this. That’s why I play traditional because basically day one, I walked in there and he said, “Hold this one like a hammer.” That was easy. And then when he showed me this, I was nine years old and it just feels totally weird. But I stuck with it and I love it and that’s the only reason that I play traditional grip, really, is because my very first teacher, Jack Iden, that’s how he showed me to hold the sticks. And I like it. I’m glad that I do it because so many of my favorite drummers play that way. I like the way it looks, I like the way it feels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, growing up in Dallas, I had a lot of great teachers there. I was really lucky to have a really good music program going on in the Dallas school district back then. I went to a really great high school called the Arts Magnum High School. Half the day I was playing big band, small group, music theory, and it was great. I had this whole collective of friends in Dallas. I still do. Great musicians. We would basically jam after school and jam on the weekends and there is just a ton of great musicians down there. All kinds of people who’ve gone on to do tons of great stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/mgtpZxKPZLc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Anyway, so then I moved up to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berklee_College_of_Music&quot;&gt;Berklee&lt;/a&gt;, did a year at Berklee, which was great. That was the year I practiced ten hours a day and just lived in the practice room. It really did a lot for me. I really developed good discipline for practice, which has stuck with me to this day. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I think practice is a really important thing and it’s good to have some discipline and have a routine with it. I always practiced, even in high school, I studied and took lessons and worked really hard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But it was that year that I think things really changed because it’s the beauty of going away to college and graduating high school and having that opportunity to not have to work a real job and just focus. Live and breathe the stuff. It really can change–I think you can change the way you play. Anything that you put a ton of time into, you can see massive changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;That one year at Berklee was the year that I think I really got my stuff together. A lot. It changed the way I played. I moved back to Dallas for a year and played in a bunch of different bands. I played pretty much every gig under the sun. From jazz bands, rock bands, blues bands, wedding gigs, you name it, I did it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And then I decided I wanted to move to New York. I always knew that I either wanted to be in LA or New York. I was kind of attracted to New York. I liked the vibe here. A lot of the records I grew up listening to, particularly the jazz records, I’d look on it and see so much of the stuff was going on here. I’d been here a few times from when I went to Berklee. I’d take a bus down and check out the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Anyway, I heard about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_of_Jazz_(The_New_School)&quot;&gt;The New School&lt;/a&gt;. Actually, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Hargrove&quot;&gt;Roy Hargrove&lt;/a&gt;, the trumpet player. I went to high school with Roy. In that year that I was back in town between Berklee and New York, we did a lot of gigs together. We were driving up to Denver to a gig one night and he handed me the–I was telling him I was thinking about going to New York City and he handed me this pamphlet. He was like, “Man, I heard about this place, The New School. They’re starting a jazz program there.” So that’s how I heard about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I came up here and auditioned and this great, great saxophone player and teacher named &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnie_Lawrence&quot;&gt;Arnie Lawrence&lt;/a&gt; was the head of the school. I auditioned for him and it was a great audition. I basically did the playing part of it, everything was cool. Then he said, “Okay, cool. Come on up to my office for the interview section.” So he looks me in the eye and said, “You really want to deal with this bullshit?” And I said, “Yep.” He said, “You’re in the school.” It was great, you know? Of course, I had no idea what he was talking about. I was 19 years old, you know? Of course, now I get it. But anyway, it was great. I moved up to New York.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xb1e3EyVMtA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;This guy was incredible. He was a real mentor. I turned out doing a lot of gigs with Arnie and once the Spin Doctors got together, he would play a lot of shows with us. Anyway, at the time, it was just a great group of people at The New School. I met the guys in The Spin Doctors there, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_Doctors&quot;&gt;Eric [Schenkman]&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Barron&quot;&gt;Chris [Barron]&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Popper&quot;&gt;John Popper&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues_Traveler&quot;&gt;Blues Traveler&lt;/a&gt; was there. And then you had &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Mehldau&quot;&gt;Brad Mehldau&lt;/a&gt; was there, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Goldings&quot;&gt;Larry Goldings&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Bernstein_(guitarist)&quot;&gt;Peter Bernstein&lt;/a&gt;, and just a ton of incredible musicians. So many of them have gone on to do great stuff and are active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It was just a really cool environment and there was none of this–we were the rock band in school. I was playing jazz, too. I was always doing all the jazz stuff, but I was also in this rock band. We were gigging around town and we’d rehearse up at the school. Then you often find in the jazz school world that people are very snobbish and the jazzers don’t want to hang out with the rock guys and the rock guys don’t want to hang out with the jazz guys. You felt a little bit of that at Berklee, although I was also the guy at Berklee that was–I’d be doing a jazz session, a blues session, a heavy metal session. This was 1986 when I went there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I always just ignored all that stuff. I was like, “Listen, I’m into everything. I’m going to do everything. If you don’t like it, I don’t care. This is who I am.”&lt;/span&gt; But I found in the New School, everybody there was just so open-minded. Brad Mehldau, he would come out to our gigs and I remember him saying how much he liked &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Allman_Brothers_Band&quot;&gt;The Allman Brothers&lt;/a&gt; and he dug our band. Same thing with Peter Bernstein and Larry Goldings. It was just a great environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Anyway, to make a long story short, we started playing all over New York. We took kind of the opposite approach to most bands at the time, which was everybody wanted to get a record deal. Everybody would rehearse five nights a week and try to get a big showcase and get a record deal. That was the goal. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;For us, we just totally flipped it. Our goal was we wanted to write songs, we wanted to be a really great band, we wanted to be unique and do our own thing and we wanted to get gigs and pay our rent playing our own music. That was pretty much it. So we decided, rather than rehearsing five nights a week, let’s try to play five nights a week.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;We just played everywhere in New York. We used to call it “the tour of Manhattan.” We just gigged and gigged and gigged. There was a lot of different clubs we could play at. We kind of had our core spots. We were always trying different places. Everybody was like, “There’s all these rules,” which they still have. Like, “If you play here, you can’t play anywhere in town for two weeks beforehand.” We were like, “Okay.” And we would be playing down the street the next night. It’s ridiculous. How are we supposed to make a living playing one [place]?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;We just ignored all that and the cool thing is because we were doing it so much, a couple things happened. For one, it was the greatest way to develop our sound and our music because, let’s face it, nothing beats playing in a group in front of people. Rehearsing is great, and that’s key as well, practice is great, but there’s something that happens when you’re actually on stage in front of an audience. It doesn’t happen in the rehearsal room.&lt;/span&gt; And so we really developed our sound fully from just playing night after night and we would play three hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It wasn’t like now where you get a 45-minute set. We played places where we could play the whole night. We would do–we might do a set–we played this place called The Nightingale Bar on 2nd Ave, it was kind of our home turf. We’d go on at 10, we played til 11:30 or 12, we’d take a break, and then we’d play til 2. Sometimes we’d do a third set. On weekends, we’d do the classic third set and we’d play until 4 in the morning. We’d literally play five-hour gigs. It was great. We got really good doing that and we developed a voice of our own. Our own sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/MtFEgnSnBG8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;As a drummer, it was a great opportunity to be in my own creative band where we could pretty much do what we wanted to do and kind of develop my own sound. So that was great. Through that we, just based on getting a big fan-base, the record companies started coming and we got a record deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Anyway, so based on just the constant gigging, we built up a really big fanbase in town. Eventually it just became this undeniable thing. Management and record companies started approaching us. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;We were very standoffish because we were a very self-sufficient band and we didn’t want anybody to come in and fuck with us.&lt;/span&gt; Eventually, we found a manager we liked and he got us a record deal and blah blah blah. Went on, obviously. It took a long time. We did a live record, we put out the first record to really–kind of silence. But we kept touring and kept touring and eventually sparked some interest about a year and a half in. And then things kind of blew up and went where they went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah, you were totally in the right place at the right time. It’s awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AC: Yeah, it was a good time. That era was a good time for bands and for the music business. It was really thriving. CDs were only three or four years old, so the record companies had a ton of money because they were selling cassettes, CDs, they were still selling vinyl. People were going back and buying their favorite records from the old days on CD again. So, as hard as it was, and it was really hard, there was that opportunity if you could get to that point where you could get that support. We had to really fight for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Our record company was not really behind us at all. They did pretty much nothing&lt;/span&gt; and–in fact, after about a year, they were like, “Come back. This record’s dead. Make a new record.” &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;We were like, “Listen, we’re out here on the road with absolutely no help from you. We’re making a living. We’re packing clubs around the country. 400-500 people are coming out. There’s a buzz.”&lt;/span&gt; So we decided to just go back out on the road and push it. We had this weird feeling. We could feel something was brewing. And that’s what we did. And a spark came out and the record company decided, “Okay, this is worth it.” They put some money behind it and boom. You know? So, anyway, that was cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/e86omL8uzks?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;To go back to your original question, from there that pretty much took me through most of the 90s with The Spin Doctors. I’d come to town and I’d do gigs around town. I’d always do jazz gigs and blues gigs and stuff like that when I was in town with people, but for the most part, The Spin Doctors took up pretty much all of my time in the 90s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Once we got to the end of the 90s, the record sales declined, we weren’t that hot Top 10 band anymore. At that point, our guitar player wasn’t with us anymore. It just felt kind of like it’s a good time to give it a little break for a while and give us the opportunity individually to kind of do some other stuff, which we all wanted to do. So I started to get into–I built a studio in my apartment and I started to get into producing and I started to get into playing on other people’s record and I really wanted to put myself out there as a guy that can do sessions and play with other people as a side man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;That’s something I always–growing up, I was just as interested in being a jazz guy as I was being a studio guy as I was being in a rock band. When I came here, all those three things were kind of–I wanted to do them. I wanted to be prepared for whatever opportunity came to me. I made a decision after being in The Spin Doctors for a while, “This seems pretty cool. I’m going to give this a year or two and see.” &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I found it’s smart in your career, sometimes you’ve got to make the right decision if you feel like something’s a good opportunity and it’s working for you creatively, which is the most important thing to go for.&lt;/span&gt; So I made that decision with The Spin Doctors and obviously it worked out great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So here we are at the end of the 90s and we’re kind of not really split up, but we’re not active for a while. It was great, but I had to prove myself to a lot of people. I already had a good reputation as a drummer around New York, but I think people thought of me as, “Oh yeah, he’s in that band.” A lot of different things. Like, “He sounds great with them, but maybe he can’t do this.” I had a lot people telling me they thought I’d charge too much money. “He’s in this popular band. We can’t afford him.” All kinds of silly stuff. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I can’t tell you how many times I had people coming to me saying, “Man, we spent, like, 10 hours trying to get your snare sound. That sound you got on that record.” And I’m like, “Dude, just call me. It’s right here, you know? You can spend all day.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/srcmtEUBmE0?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I think there’s a lot of things that I had to get out there, like, one, I can play. I’m versatile. Two, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I’m not going to charge you a million bucks just because I come from a well-known band.&lt;/span&gt; Then it was great. It took a minute, to be honest, but after doing that, all of a sudden you get the reputation, “Okay well this guy can do this.” And here we are down the road where I’m very active as a side man, a session guy, and we got the band back together shortly after that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Around 2001, we started to get the original guys back together. We started playing some gigs. It’s gotten back to the point where we’ve made three more record and we do probably 30-40 shows a year and it’s just great. The band sounds killer, everybody’s playing as good as ever. I think you saw us out in California, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: In Phoenix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AC: Phoenix, right!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: You played at the Ostrich Festival here. That’s a weird thing that happens here, but I’d never actually–I grew up in New York and I remember hearing an interview with you on the radio and you said, “I’m really a jazz player playing in a rock band, but I like playing rock music.” Or something like that. And that stuck with me ever since I was a kid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AC: Oh, that’s cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: And then to hear, when I got to see you for the first time live last year at the Ostrich Festival, I couldn’t believe how good you guys were. Some other bands were playing and I was like, “Wow.” The Spin Doctors actually kept it together. Some of these other bands that played that’ve been around a long time, they were falling apart. And my friend, who has done some work for some of these bands, he’s like, “Spin Doctors killed it.” You guys were really–you guys were on top of it. It was an awesome show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AC: Thank you. That’s why I still love doing the band. For one, it’s all four original members. There’s not a lot of bands that still have that. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;All four of us are lifers. Everybody’s completely dedicated to their craft. People practice, they’re busy, and when we get together, there’s a sound. We don’t fuck around, as you can see. We get up there and we play. We don’t get up there, we’re not just up there trying to get paid. If you come see us, we’re going to do it. If that wasn’t the vibe, I wouldn’t even think about doing it anymore because I see a lot of these bands you’re talking about and it’s one guy left in the band or something.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;A bunch of side guys and they’re just going through the motions. There’s a lot of great bands. Listen, I realize that it’s hard to keep a band together. And a lot of them sound great, but &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;you definitely see the bands that are just out there to collect a check. I get it. You gotta make a living, but for me I can’t–sure I gotta make a living too. I’m not going to do something that doesn’t feel–for me it’s gotta feel good and creative and I’m getting satisfaction out of it or I’ll just get depressed. I can’t do that kind of thing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah, well one way I can tell is having followed you on Instagram for a while, I’ve seen you post this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Stick-Control-George-Lawrence-Stone/dp/1892764040&quot;&gt;Stick Control book&lt;/a&gt; and videos of you using a metronome, hitting your practice pad, and I was like, “Wow that’s really cool. This guy who’s been playing probably 40 years has kept up a practice regimen and that’s been important to him.” Yeah actually, why don’t you…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/qFnlwYt8w1Q?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer interviewee&quot;&gt;AC: I got my books right here. You’re absolutely right. I appreciate that. Listen, I started taking lessons again five years ago from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Carvin&quot;&gt;Michael Carvin&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;It’s very important, the older you get and the more that you’re busy, it’s very easy to–you gotta do things so you don’t get into a rut.&lt;/span&gt; To me, it’s just a neverending kind of thing. To continue to get better and expand the way I play and how my style–&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I don’t want to play the same way I played 20 years ago now, or 10 years ago.&lt;/span&gt; The cool thing is you’ve got all that stuff. I got all the things I’ve done and all the styles and my own little language, but you don’t want to just stop. Like, “Okay, well that’s what I do.” You want to do all that, but the idea is to keep adding to it. I’ve been really focused on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;As far as practicing, I always have my trusty Reflexx pad here in my kitchen and I have all my books. A bunch of books I love to go through. This is one that I–I got them dated. This is crazy. I used to do this shit–look at this. This is my old–May ‘83. And I opened these books a while ago and I’m like, “Holy shit.” I don’t even know how I did it back then, but it’s been cool to go back to them and go through these things. I make a point to go through this stuff. Here, I’ll give you a little taste of this one here. This one here. This is great. I’m sitting down so it’ll be kind of weird. [Plays]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Anyway, it’s great. And I love just doing it every day. I try to spend some time out of these books. Concert snare drum reading. And then I got–where’s the other one here? Well of course, my favorite is syncopation. A million ways to do syncopation. I go through that every day. You know, there’s just tons of–where’s my other favorite? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Portraits-Rhythm-Studies-Snare-Drum/dp/0769214398&quot;&gt;Portraits of Rhythm&lt;/a&gt;. This is the one that I love. Old rudiment–It’s like a rudimentary. Yeah, so anyway, I try to spend a little bit of time every day on the practice pad doing rudiments and reading. I find that it really helps me to focus. And I forgot–I should put this one on. I love this thing. This little &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Beat&quot;&gt;Dr. Beat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/OLIs6ta8n78?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah, how old is that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AC: Well, I used to have one of these when I was a kid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AC: They keep breaking and I just keep buying them on eBay. This is probably the tenth one I bought. Whenever one of them breaks, I just go on eBay and I find that they’re out there and I buy them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Your apartment is sinking again. [Laughs.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AC: Oh I’m sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: It’s okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AC: I don’t know. There’s something about it. Maybe it reminded me of when I was 12 practicing, but just for at home practice, I just love it. So I always do a little, even if it’s 10 minutes. I walk past this thing every day. Even if I just sit there and do that. And then I like to do–I try to, depending on my schedule–I have a recording studio and my drums are always set up and if I’m free and there’s not a session in there, then I try to go in and practice. I’ve been really into that lately. And I’ve been getting back into all kinds of crazy books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;There’s a million ways to do syncopation. I recently went back in this book that I did when I was, like, 20 by a guy named &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Magadini&quot;&gt;Pete Magadini&lt;/a&gt;. The original book is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Poly-Cymbal-Time-Peter-Magadini/dp/B072JN3RW5&quot;&gt;Poly-Cymbal Time&lt;/a&gt; and I think now it’s reissued as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Polyrhythms-Drumset-Book-Peter-Magadini/dp/089724821X&quot;&gt;Polyrhythms for the Drumset&lt;/a&gt;, I think. This is an amazing book and it really opened–I’m really into–if you listen to my music or come see my own band live, I do a lot of weird rhythmical stuff. I’ve always been really into that. This was the book that really opened my eyes to that. It’s very much metric modulation, four-way independence, but with doing things with the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zrJFMAh-WaI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So I went back through this book and I was like, “Wow.” It took me a minute. You gotta really–it’s fun. When you practice, I like to work on stuff that I can’t do. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I always think, “If you sound like shit when you’re practicing, then you’re making progress.” If you’re in there and you’re just sounding great–I mean, anybody can go in… I can play all my best stuff and feel like a million bucks, but I’ll save that for the gig. Know what I mean? That’s what you do when you’re at the gig.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But when you’re practicing, at least for me, I want to work on things that I really can’t do, like from a technical standpoint. Go in there and start something up that you can’t do. Sometimes it takes minute, but then an hour in, all of a sudden you’ve got it. Repetitive motion, you do it do it do it, then you’ve got it. And you can bust it out. It’s all about having these tools for when you’re improvising, they’re there for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So that’s kind of my concept of practice. I like to divide it up between the snare drum reading stuff, warm-up, hands, and then do all kinds of different books and technical exercises with four-way independence and time. And then if I have time, I’ll spend some time–if there’s some ideas I’ve been working on, some of my own concepts with different beats or improvisation, but I find that the main thing that I do in the practice is work on technique stuff. Things that have been giving me a hard time or just things I can’t do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah, so what does an expert professional drummer like you do taking lessons? What are you focused on? For some people, including myself, I see a drummer like you, I listen to your new album, I’m like, “Man this guy’s incredible,” and then I think there’s this kind of mentality that once you’re a professional, you don’t need lessons anymore or something. What are you taking lessons on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AC: Think about it. You often hear about actors going back and they’re always studying. No matter how old they are, you always hear, “I’m going to an acting class,” or, “I have an acting coach.” Many times you hear it with vocalists, too. “I was working on…” It’s an instrument. Basketball players, professional top-level guys, they’re in practice and there’s coaches. Somehow musicians think they can just get good and then they’re done. That’s okay, like anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/LsrXPaaY3bA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;You get very busy and I think for me I’m so lucky to have so many great teachers my whole youth up until my early 20s. I’ve always taken a lesson here or a lesson there from drummers. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;About five years ago, I felt like I needed a fresh kick in the ass.&lt;/span&gt; I’d been so busy. When you get busy running from gig to gig–I was doing so many gigs. Technique things, I was looking at my hands and like, “Wow, what the hell am I doing?” Not that I really care so much about technique. The main thing to me is I feel like you can do whatever you want to get the sound out of the drums, to express yourself, whatever it takes is fine. But, with that said, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;when I practice, I do like to focus on my technique. And when I get to the gig, whatever.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;When I’m in the studio recording or I’m on a gig making music, I don’t want to think about anything. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I don’t want to think about what I practiced, I don’t want to think about my hands. It’s all about making music.&lt;/span&gt; That’s the thing. But having that discipline in practice, it carries over. So I was feeling just kind of burnt out and I’m running around, like gig, gig, gig, gig. I felt like I wanted some kind of–it’d be great to take some lessons again. Let’s see what happens. Maybe I can kind of shape up some of this technique stuff, some of these bad habits I’m noticing. Maybe I can get some help to rein them in and let’s just see what happens. I don’t even know. I know how to work on my technique. I know what I need to work on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I’m good at picking up books. I’m smart about knowing, “This is what I need to work on. This is what I’m gonna do.” So I started asking around New York, tons of people. This is when I was 45. I’m going to be 50 in April. This was about 5 years ago or so. I started asking people, “Hey man, I really want to take lessons. Any suggestions?” And the guy’s name that kept coming up was Michael Carvin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Michael is a great, great teacher and an amazing drummer too. Incredible. He played with all kinds of people. If you go on YouTube and press in “Michael Carvin with Freddie Hubbard.” There’s this clip that’s just–he’s as good as anybody. He’s just incredible. But he’s also an incredible teacher. His name kept coming up so I was like, “Okay, I’ll give it a shot.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/2HT3wBgwCO8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So actually &lt;a href=&quot;https://euphorianyc.com/&quot;&gt;Dave Sokol&lt;/a&gt;, who is the guy who runs this rehearsal studio called &lt;a href=&quot;https://euphorianyc.com/&quot;&gt;Euphoria Studios&lt;/a&gt;, which is kind of the best place in town, and Dave, who is a big fan of Carvin’s and had studied with him–he’s the guy who put me in touch with him and I just called him up and said, “Hey man.” He asked me, “What do you want to do? Why are you calling me?” I said, “Well you know, I’m in my mid-40s and &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I’ve been playing professionally for 25-30 years now and I just want to take things to the next level. I want to keep learning.” So he was like, “Well you’re really smart. That’s a good attitude.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So we had a short little conversation and we went to the lesson. I met him at his place and I go in there and he’s known for ripping people apart on the first lesson. A lot of people don’t go back. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I’ve talked to people that have gone to this guy and they were offended and, “I couldn’t believe the shit he said to me. I’ll never go back again.” But then the other 50% walk away and they’re just like, “This guy was unbelievable. He changed my life. He changed my playing. He changed my life and perspective.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So he definitely ripped me apart. I kind of expected it, but I wasn’t really sure. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;He didn’t give a fuck that I was in The Spin Doctors, that I played on this record or that record. It doesn’t matter. He doesn’t care.&lt;/span&gt; At least then he didn’t. So the first lesson, he was just pretty much like, “You’ve got no sound.” He just beat me down. [Laughs.] I took it well and I was like, “Okay cool. Whatever. Great.” And I took it and I went back. And it ended up being this great thing. Now he’s got a lot of respect for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Now, if anything, he’s helped give me even more confidence, which is great. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;You don’t want to go to a teacher and have him tell you you’re the greatest in the world from the get-go. You gotta get somewhere.&lt;/span&gt; But he’s been very good and I think he at first started out with some technique stuff. He got me back into going through syncopation and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Techniques-Modern-Drummer-Independence/dp/0757995403&quot;&gt;the Chapin book&lt;/a&gt;. I went to the Chapin book again because I hadn’t in probably 25 years. You know the book I’m talking about? &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Chapin&quot;&gt;Jim Chapin&lt;/a&gt; book?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/u_L--a3UCeA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: No I don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AC: It’s kind of like one of the bibles for drum set. You should get it. You should definitely get it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: I only play drums recreationally, so yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AC: Oh okay. Well there you go. Anybody listening, if you’re a drummer and you want to–it’s one of the books that’s kind of a must to go through. And I went through it really young. So, he got me to go back through some of these things that I hadn’t done in a while. That kind of inspired me to pull out all these old books that I showed you before. But the main thing he did was really help inspire me and help push me to do things that I hadn’t done. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;He said, “You gotta try to get out of your comfort zone.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Obviously, we all know you can do this, you can do that, you got this gig, you got that gig. Everything’s cool, but let’s do something where you’re going to get out of your comfort zone. Let’s do something you’re not good at and you don’t feel comfortable with.” He was very encouraging to me. He was like, “You have a lot to offer. Why don’t you start doing some drum clinics?” I’d never done them before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I always shied away from it because I didn’t want to get in front of a crowd of people and have to talk and have to do that. He really pushed that and at first, I was like, “I don’t know. That’s never been my thing.” But I took his advice and I did one, this was about five years ago. I think the first one I did was at &lt;a href=&quot;https://thecollective.edu/divisions/drummers-collective/&quot;&gt;The Drummer’s Collective&lt;/a&gt; and I just did another one last week. Since then I’ve done quite a few of them and I love it now. It was really–I think I learned a lot about it because, for one, when you have to sit there and talk about yourself or about music, especially &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;when you have to demonstrate things, you learn a lot yourself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/JbHsMosfxqE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;The main thing, it was just an example of something that wasn’t necessarily in my comfort zone that I did. When you do that kind of stuff, it just opens up all kinds of other possibilities. I had already started making my own records and doing my own band, but I’ve obviously kept that going and done–I play regularly with my group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I have a couple of different groups that I do on my own. It’s really been great to–for all these years, Spin Doctors and playing on people’s records and playing with other artists like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Osborne&quot;&gt;Joan Osborne&lt;/a&gt;. All these people, which I love doing, I love it, but to have your own group is kind of the ultimate thing. Something that represents me 100%. It’s my music. It’s my concept. I use players that I want to bring into that, that I work well with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s just been great. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;It’s just been such a great creative outlet for me to make these records and do these shows.&lt;/span&gt; I don’t look at it as–for me, it’s just 100% creative. All the stuff I do is creative, but obviously as a career musician, obviously the reality is you gotta make money. You look in the different things that I have going now, it’s taken me a long time to get to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Luckily, 30 years into New York, I’ve got my band Spin Doctors, which are up and running very well these days. I’ve got my side-man stuff, working with people like Joan Osborne, I play with this great artist in Germany named &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marius_M%C3%BCller-Westernhagen&quot;&gt;Marius Westernhagen&lt;/a&gt;. He’s a big star over there. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Maddock&quot;&gt;James Maddock&lt;/a&gt; and a lot of the different groups that I play drums for and doing records with people. Having my studio. And then I’ve got my own music. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;And obviously these other things pay the bills. I usually lose money with my band. [Laughs.] But I don’t care. It’s part of the whole portfolio, as they say.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Some gigs you’re gonna make a lot of money, some gigs you’re gonna make a little money, and some gigs you might lose money. As long as it balances out, but it’s very important to–I think it’s always a bad idea to base all your decisions on money. I’ve always tried to base everything I do on creativity and being fulfilled. Any time I’ve ever taken something that felt like it was just for the money, I think it just never felt right.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/5ftDRl4kNXI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;One of the things that I’ve kind of–I’ve actually learned to say “no.” Drummers, musicians. We don’t know the word “no,” man. “Hey can you play Tuesday night?” “Okay!” I think for a while, when I first started seeing Carvin, I was just running around, I didn’t want to say “no” to anything. It was cool because we all want to be really busy and I’m really grateful. Sometimes, the more you’re out there, the more you stay busy, the more gigs you get, and that’s part of it. But it’s also important–you can also wake up, which is what happened to me, waking up overloaded. “Oh my God, I’ve got 10 sets of music I’ve gotta learn. I’ve got this gig…” It can get a little distracting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I’ve realized I’ve learned how to say “no” to stuff. I really try to–&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I realized “no” is not a bad word. It’s actually healthy. Don’t put yourself in a situation that’s going to run you down and it’s not going to really be creatively fulfilling for you. You don’t want to be out there playing stuff that’s not good, either, because people see that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: So speaking of that, you have so much great music out there available for free on YouTube. Your performances at the Rockwood Music Hall with &lt;a href=&quot;/interview/teddy-kumpel&quot;&gt;Teddy [Kumpel]&lt;/a&gt; and I’ve seen gigs with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jojo_Mayer&quot;&gt;Jojo Mayer&lt;/a&gt;. You’ve got all-star lineups sometimes playing with you and your bands. I was wondering if you could get into some of that and how it’s led into your new album, Sculptures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AC: Yeah, absolutely. Basically, I started making my own records in 2006. My first record is a record called &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/catskills-cry/id187132927&quot;&gt;Catskills Cry&lt;/a&gt;. It’s me, I wrote all the music on guitar–a lot of what I write is on guitar. And I got Bill Dillon, who’s an amazing guitar player from Canada, who I met–he played on a lot of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbie_Robertson&quot;&gt;Robbie Robertson&lt;/a&gt; records. He’s just got this vibe. I did a record with him in the late 90s with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Cohn&quot;&gt;Marc Cohn&lt;/a&gt; and I was like, “Who’s this guitar player?” I was like, “This guy’s unbelievable.” He just stuck with me, so about–whatever it was, 8-10 years later when I got around to doing my record, I was like, “I gotta call this guy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZUhKqirfnss?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So I called up Bill and I was like, “Hey man, I want you to do this record with me.” So we worked it out. And then I had an idea to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Levin&quot;&gt;Tony Levin&lt;/a&gt; and Bill knew Tony and inside of about an hour, we had the whole thing. It was done. We had it booked. Bill hooked me up with an engineer in Woodstock named &lt;a href=&quot;http://romanklun.com/&quot;&gt;Roman Klun&lt;/a&gt;, who’s now my partner in my studio. We share a recording studio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So it all led back to that record. And it’s a great record. I’ll always really love that record. It was the first one I did. We never did any gigs because everyone lived in different places. It was just a really cool vibey record. I owe a lot to those guys. It’s just great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;That was the beginning. And then a few years later when I decided to make my second record, which is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/beautiful-mistake/id436071053&quot;&gt;Beautiful Mistake&lt;/a&gt;, I’d always loved Teddy Kumpel. You know Teddy. Incredible musician, guitar player. We’ve done a lot of playing together over the years. I knew right away, “This is the guy I want to have play guitar on my record.” I also knew that I wanted to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://richard-hammond.com/&quot;&gt;Richard Hammond&lt;/a&gt; on bass, who’s another amazing bass player. Really good friend of mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: He is incredible. I listened to–it was a live album. I think it was a trio. You, Teddy, and Richard. I listened to that yesterday or the day before. I couldn’t believe Richard’s playing. He is such a melodic player and he fills in so much. I couldn’t believe it was a trio at times as I was listening to it. And Teddy is on another planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AC: Teddy’s incredible. Yeah, Rich, we’ve done so much together. We both played in Joan Osborne’s band for 11-12 years together. We’ve done a ton of gigs. You’re lucky when you meet–every drummer and bass player, you always have a couple of bass players you just really gel with. Richard is just one of those guys. We get together, we don’t have to say a word to each other. It just happens, no matter what kind of music we’re playing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ixwf6rH9tgM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So I knew that I wanted to get Teddy and Richard together. I made demos. I wrote most of the songs on guitar, so I made demos and I sent it to those guys and I was like, “Listen, I want to make this record. Here’s the music.” We didn’t even rehearse. I was like, “Learn the music. This is the basic structure. These are the parts.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I felt kind of bad because, particularly on those record, it’s very guitar-oriented and there’s very specific parts on the melody sections, the heads of the songs, they’re very specific. And then there’s parts of the songs that are more open. I can’t thank Teddy enough for putting up with me. He did such an amazing job of learning the stuff that I wrote and making it his own, but totally respecting the parts. It was amazing. So, I told those guys, “Look we’re not going to rehearse. We’re doing two days, but you gotta do your homework. I want to come in–We’ve all played together, but this is a new band. I want it to sound like we’ve been playing together for five years.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Those guys did their homework. We just had a great session. Some really magical moments happened off the floor. When you get in the studio, you have an idea of what something is going to be. Like the song “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBqSUZa5VMs&quot;&gt;Past, Present, &amp;amp; Future&lt;/a&gt;,” which is one of my favorite songs, it’s a song we play live a lot–when we got in there and started playing it, I had this kind of simple bass line and Rich came up with this thing and it just turned into this amazing moment. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Those are the things that make records so great. You come in prepared and you have an idea, but then something special happens off the cuff and then you grab it and work with it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/iBqSUZa5VMs?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Anyway, so after that record, that was the first time I started doing gigs. We did a record release show. All of a sudden, it was like, “Wow, I’ve got a band. We’ve got songs.” So we just started, ever since then. That trio has been playing maybe once a month or so around New York and we go out of town every once in a while. It’s just turned into a great band. We did another record a few years later called &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/blues-for-use-feat.-richard/id826564090&quot;&gt;Blues for Use&lt;/a&gt;. And then we did that live record that you were talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: That waltz track is hysterical, man. That lead melody, I’m like, “Where did that melody come from?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AC: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XvlpLEA5Hs&quot;&gt;Catskills Last Waltz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/8XvlpLEA5Hs?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AC: Actually, I used to have a house in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catskill_Mountains&quot;&gt;Catskills&lt;/a&gt;. I sold it. I was sitting on the couch right before I was getting rid of it. I was literally about to leave, all my stuff was packed up and I was getting ready to get in my car and say goodbye to the house and I had my dobro there and I just wrote that little melody. So I called it Catskills Last Waltz. It’s kind of like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelonious_Monk&quot;&gt;[Thelonius] Monk&lt;/a&gt; vibe. I think it was kind of a Thelonius Monk-type melody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: I could see that. Yeah. Yeah, a lot of kind of close notes and very chromatic but fun. I just thought it was a really cool track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AC: Thank you. So, from that, I also did a jazz quintet record with Teddy and Rich, Keith Loftis who’s an incredible sax player, and then &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barney_McAll&quot;&gt;Barney McAll&lt;/a&gt;, a bass and piano player. We did a record live up in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smokejazz.com/&quot;&gt;Smoke Jazz Club&lt;/a&gt; and we put that out. And then I kept all these groups going then I started doing this band called the Air-Conditioned Gypsies, which is basically just a collective of musicians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s all improvisation and I basically–for a while, I was doing every three months, now I’m maybe doing it twice a year or so. I just call up different musicians that I want to play with to play. I think about it, “Who’s gonna play well together?” And it’s just been great. I’ve done some great ones. I’ve done a couple double drums with Jojo Mayer. They’re on YouTube, like you said. A couple with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Guiliana&quot;&gt;Mark Guiliana&lt;/a&gt;, both on YouTube. Those are both–those guys are both incredible, innovative drummers who’ve influence me a lot. So that was great. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernon_Reid&quot;&gt;Vernon Reid&lt;/a&gt;’s done a bunch of ‘em. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerry_Leonard&quot;&gt;Gerry Leonard&lt;/a&gt; did some. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.olirockberger.com/&quot;&gt;Oli Rockberger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.johndavismusic.info/&quot;&gt;John Davis&lt;/a&gt;, Richard Hammond, Teddy–it’s a long list of great musicians that have been involved in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/RczweEBTtXY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Anyway, so when it came to thinking about making a new record, which is the record that’s coming out next Friday, I believe. March 16. It’s called &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/sculptures/1332320542&quot;&gt;Sculptures&lt;/a&gt;. I wanted to do something a little different. I had made two records with Teddy and Rich that were kind of based on my acoustic guitar compositions. Me sitting around and I write a lot of stuff on acoustic and that’s where those songs came from. I wanted to do something different. I’ve been experimenting with all the improv stuff, which I’ve always been into. Getting into a little more of the electronic vibe, which brings me to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.leongruenbaum.com/&quot;&gt;Leon Greunbaum&lt;/a&gt;. Leon’s the guy that I always use on the Air-Conditioned Gypsies. I always use different people, but Leon is in every gig. So far, he’s been available for every one I’ve asked him to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: He’s the guy who plays that invented instrument, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.leongruenbaum.com/samchilliankidchillian&quot;&gt;Samchillian&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AC: Exactly. He plays the Samchillian. You can look it up. It’s this crazy thing that he invented and I just love him. He’s just an incredible musician. He’s so creative and he comes up with such great ideas and sonic sounds. So I really wanted to bring him into this new record. Originally, the idea was: “Let me get together with Leon in my studio. We’ll just do some short improvisations.” So the record started with just the two of us in my studio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I didn’t want to do this jam for two hours and then cut and paste. I was like, “I want to come up with some idea before we start. A little concept, even if it was just a beat or an idea, and we’d do these things. I didn’t want any of them to be more than three minutes. Maybe four minutes. Some of them were even one or two minutes. We did a whole bunch of that and that was the start of it. And then I had a couple of songs that I had written on acoustic guitar, but they’re a little different and I recorded those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I played the guitar on those, the acoustic guitar, which I’d never–well I’d always played a little bit of guitar on my records, but not much. So that was kind of one section of it. Then I’m sitting here looking at this, I have these kind of cool improvs–and the improvs were great. Usually it would start off with just me and Leon and then sometimes Leon would overdub something on top of it. Ultimately, I had a few other people come in and play some stuff, but it was just based on these improvs. We had the improv section, we had these couple of acoustic guitar-based songs that I played, and then we had this part three, which I hadn’t really figured out yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/DL-kxy7GqQQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;My friend Oli Rockberger, who’s an amazing piano player, he’s just phenomenal. He lived in New York for a long time. He’s from London and he moved back to London about four or five years ago. He was in a band called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.misterbarrington.com/&quot;&gt;Mister Berrington&lt;/a&gt; with Zach Danziger and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Biddle_(musician)&quot;&gt;Owen [Biddle]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I used to play with them in this band with this great songwriter named James Maddock, who I used to play with a lot. He’s just always been one of my favorite musicians. He was like, “Hey I’m going to be in town, man. We should hang.” I was like, “Shit. I gotta book a session around Oli’s coming to town.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, I confirmed Oli and then I confirmed Leon and then I wanted to get–I played a few times with John Davis, who plays in Jojo Mayer’s Nerve. He lives right across the street. He can probably see me. I really hit it off with him. He filled in for Rich a couple times on our trio gig, which is now actually a quartet because Leon plays. He did an Air-Conditioned Gypsies gig. Where the music was going for this record, I felt like, “Yeah, this will be cool. I want to do something different.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So me and Oli and John and Leon got together one afternoon and I’m kind of thinking, “Shit, what am I going to do? Shit this is happening in two days.” I tend to work good under pressure. I didn’t want to–I knew I wanted it to be improv based, but I didn’t want it to just be like, “Hey kids, let’s go.” So at the 11th hour, I wrote some ideas. I wrote a couple songs. I came in there with these loose kind of song ideas. About six or seven of them. And we did them and it was just a really great session. It just clicked really well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I think out of those seven, maybe four of them went on the record. Between those three different things, that’s how I came up with this record. And then I should mention, too, that there’s a guitar player in town called &lt;a href=&quot;https://cantaloupemusic.com/artists/grey-mcmurray&quot;&gt;Grey McMurray&lt;/a&gt; who’s just incredible. He’s just this totally unique, very ambient style of playing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And so I wanted Gray to come in and just play over everything. So Gray came in and–actually, this was before the session with Oli and John and Leon. So he came in and played on all the other stuff and he just did such a great job. He added such a cool, vibey element to it. After that last session, I had him come in and play on that stuff. So it ended up being this really cool kind of vibey sort of experimental, sort of electronic-y, still really organic record. I was psyched about it. I did this really great video for the song Sculptures. You can see it on YouTube, just click in Aaron Comess Sculptures. It’ll come right up. Check it out. These really great guys did it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah it’s beautifully done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/uAZivqNXv7g?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Awesome video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AC: Thank you. I’m really, really psyched. I feel really good about it. I really wanted to do something just really–a nice piece of art to go with it. That one song is kind of a special moment for me and it’s one of my favorite things I’ve ever done. That song Sculptures was just an improv. It was one of those days Leon came in. It really was based on this rhythm. I kind of had this triplet-y rhythm idea inside of this groove and really all I said to Leon was, “I just want you to do some ambient weird stuff. I kind of have this rhythmic motif that’s going to kind of appear throughout it and let’s just see what happens.” We just did one–it’s basically just as you hear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;There’s really no editing on all the record. Everything you hear is done. And that song in particular, it just had such a beautiful shape to it. When I go back and listen to it, I’m like, “Wow this is really cool. It has a shape.” So we decided–Leon is doing all this stuff, but there’s this harmonic element, chords, so I suggested, “Why don’t you play”–he gets these great bass sounds on the Samchillian. Probably about half the record is John on bass. The other half is Samchillian bass, which is real subsonic sounding. It’s like a Moog or something. I said, “Can you figure out the harmony you did and just add bass to it?” So he did that and that was pretty much it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/1lAQG2unSfs?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: I listened to the record, like I said, five or six times yesterday as I was working. I didn’t have any meetings. I’m working from home. It’s this kind of record–&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Lanois&quot;&gt;Daniel Lanois&lt;/a&gt; has an album called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shine_(Daniel_Lanois_album)&quot;&gt;Shine&lt;/a&gt; and he designed it so it could just stay on repeat. I felt like this album is really interesting to listen to, it’s short enough that you want to listen to it again right after it’s over, and none of the songs are throwaways. You know? Everything is really good and, like you said, there’s three different vibes going on, but there’s a good mix or a blend of it as you listen through the whole thing. So I really love it. I think it’s a very creative album. Your drumming–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AC: I appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Your drumming is really creative and I really enjoyed that. And the songs are interesting. So, great job on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AC: I appreciate it. Thank you. So, it’s funny because Daniel Lanois is a really big influence on me, particularly on my solo stuff. I love all of his instrumental records. I listen to them all a lot. Like you said, the thing that I like about his records–I really like music that is really very much musical and you can listen to, but also it’s not too abrasive. You can almost have it on in the background as well. That’s what I love about all of Daniel Lanois’ records. It’s this very moody vibey thing. But there’s so much music going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;That’s really exactly what I personally tried to go on this. I purposely made it short. The bottom line is I probably recorded about two hours of music and I really kept taking stuff out, taking stuff out, and at one point the record was 12 songs. I’m trying to figure out the right order. “Ah, it doesn’t make sense, but if I pull that song out, all of a sudden it makes sense.” &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;It’s hard to let go of songs, but after doing records for so long with so many people in my home, I take it really seriously&lt;/span&gt;, even though I know a lot of people don’t listen to records all the way through, I do and I make records that are meant to be listened to all the way through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I don’t like long records. I think 37 minutes–like you said, I don’t want to hear–you want everything to be strong. That’s the idea, you know? So, I appreciate it. One last thing, going back to the song Sculptures. The final element of that is that Grey came in, Grey McMurray came in and played guitar on it. And it was really pretty amazing. This was just improv that me and Leon did. Harmonically, it’s not crazy, but it’s definitely moving around in some weird ways in weird places and Gray just–I couldn’t believe it. He just somehow tuned into it. He played the most beautiful stuff. It was like he was there and I remember–it was one of the most amazing things I’ve ever seen in the studio, how he was able to just tune into the thing. He’s really an amazing guitar player. He added a lot to the vibe of the record, for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: That’s cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AC: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: So if people want to find out more about you and your music, where’s the best place to find that information?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AC: You can go on my website, which is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aaroncomess.com/&quot;&gt;AaronComess.com&lt;/a&gt;. I recently simplified it, but it’s got most of the records I’ve played on. That’s about it. It’s got the video up there. Links to my records. The new record is coming out March 16. It’s available anywhere. Easiest place to get it is probably iTunes or come to my gig and I’ll give you a CD. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter. All that stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: All right, cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/MWYXrjLdIRE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AC: And one last thing! I’m doing a record release. A 50th birthday bash at &lt;a href=&quot;http://bluenote.net/&quot;&gt;the Blue Note in New York&lt;/a&gt; on April 23. It’s going to be my band with Teddy, Rich, Oli Rockberger’s flying in from London for it, Keith Loftis, the sax player, he’s gonna be there. We’re gonna do all my stuff as well as two really special guests. James Maddock, who’s an incredible songwriter I’ve worked with for years. He’s gonna do a few songs as well as Joan Osborne, who’s also going to be a special guest on a couple songs. It’s gonna be an amazing night. If you’re in New York, get your tickets and come out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: All right, cool! Happy 50th birthday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AC: Not yet. Not yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Almost! And congratulations on 30 years of the Spin Doctors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AC: Thank you very much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: The new record is really awesome. I’m looking forward to releasing this and telling people about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AC: I appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;lets-get-real&quot;&gt;Let’s Get Real&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll admit that a lot of a lot of my interviews focus on my admiration of the artist, trying to get at the heart of what makes them tick, and understanding their creative process. These are important topics and I’m really happy with most of the interviews on this site. However, this one gets pretty real. We talk money, streaming rates, and the “different scales of nothingness that artists are paid.” If you’re interested in how a troupe of acoustic guitarists who studied with Robert Fripp have survived for 27 years, this interview will shed some light on that. And they bravely discuss real numbers, real struggles, and real plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would be remiss if I didn’t at least acknowledge the influence of &lt;a href=&quot;http://innerviews.org&quot;&gt;Anil Prasad&lt;/a&gt; on this discussion. Most of &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.com/innerviews&quot;&gt;his facebook&lt;/a&gt; posts are about this stuff and recently he’s gotten heated on the topic of the dismal pay for artists in today’s musical climate. I admire him and he definitely made me step up this interview a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interview-transcript&quot;&gt;Interview Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Richards [PR]
Bert Lams [BL]
Hideyo Moriya [HM]
Anthony Garone [AG]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: The California Guitar Trio has been a musical tour de force for the last 27 years now and you guys are here in Phoenix, Arizona–Scottsdale, Arizona in February 2018 and I thought it’d be really cool to have a discussion about what life is like as music has evolved, as the industry has evolved, and as people’s tastes have evolved in the 27 years of your experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PR: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: And you have all evolved yourselves as individuals and as a band. I also thought, for people who have never heard the California Guitar Trio, that we could get a brief intro as to who you are and what you’ve been doing. So, Paul, why don’t you introduce yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PR: Sure, yeah. I’m Paul Richards with the California Guitar Trio and the three of us met while we were studying with British guitar player &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Fripp&quot;&gt;Robert Fripp&lt;/a&gt; back in the late 80s. All three of us attended his &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Craft&quot;&gt;Guitar Craft&lt;/a&gt; seminars and Robert had a house in the English countryside called Red Lion House. He invited some of the students to go to England to study music together at Red Lion House and that’s where the three of us–it’s the time period that the three of us met. We met Bert the first time in Switzerland on a Guitar Craft course that Robert was doing there during that time period, but then Bert came over to Red Lion House and we began playing together as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Craft&quot;&gt;League of Crafty Guitarists&lt;/a&gt;. [See our &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/steve-ball&quot;&gt;interview with Steve Ball&lt;/a&gt;, another former Crafty Guitarist.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/e_fPaRajJ0A?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, we were working with Robert for four or five years before we formed the California Guitar Trio. Bert had just moved to Los Angeles and invited the three of us to go to LA in 1991. So we formed the California Guitar Trio in February of 1991. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;So, we’re just celebrating our 27th anniversary now.&lt;/span&gt; At that time we were just starting out playing and we just took any gig that we could in LA. Tiny little coffee shops, we even played at the Blind Institute and a home for autistic people. Then as we began playing more and more together, we got invited to do different things. Robert invited us to open up a series of concerts that he did with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Sylvian&quot;&gt;David Sylvian&lt;/a&gt;. He and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trey_Gunn&quot;&gt;Trey Gunn&lt;/a&gt; and David Sylvian did several tours together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So in 1992, we did several tours with David Sylvian and Robert and then a few years later, Robert invited the three of us to open for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Crimson&quot;&gt;King Crimson&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;We did over 130 concerts with King Crimson worldwide.&lt;/span&gt; Those were just the few things that helped us. As an acoustic guitar trio, a big challenge is getting to the point where we can tour and play and make any kind of living doing this. So, we did have some help along the way from Robert, but a lot of it we did ourselves–and during our first year, Bert was getting on the phone and calling up these venues in LA just to get gigs for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;For our first eight or nine years together, we did everything ourselves aside from the short tours we did opening for other bands. But, we booked all of our own gigs and arranged all the details and then around–was it ‘98? ‘98 or ‘99 we got an agency who started helping us book shows and then in early 2001 or 2002, we got with our agent who we have now, which is &lt;a href=&quot;https://sroartists.com/&quot;&gt;SRO Artists&lt;/a&gt;. That was a really good thing for us. They had worked with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Hedges&quot;&gt;Michael Hedges&lt;/a&gt;, who was one of their main acoustic guitar players, and so they had really good connections with acoustic guitar venues. He was one of the first acoustic guitar greats that was playing for large audiences. So, SRO helped us get into a lot of venues that we had previously been trying to on our own. To this day, they help keep us going now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: That’s great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;BL: I’ll talk a little bit about before the three of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Sure, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;BL: I was born in Belgium and around the age of 13 or 14 [the room lights went out].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;BL: Around the age of 13 or 14, I heard mainly blues music and I wanted to play the guitar. Electric guitar was my first love, so I bought an electric guitar and started playing with my friends around–I taught myself how to play guitar by listening to blues music. I always had this desire to go to America and study the guitar in America, but it didn’t materialize until later. When I finished high school, rather than go to Berklee College of Music, which was a good option but too expensive for me at that time. I couldn’t afford that, or my parents wouldn’t let me do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So I went to the Conservatory of Music in Brussels with little preparation and I gloriously failed the entrance exam, but they referred me to a really good teacher and then in a couple of years, I really caught up. That’s where I really started to play the guitar more seriously. In the meantime, I kept playing the electric guitar and listening to electric guitar music. Maybe six or seven years later after I graduated and started teaching, while I was teaching, I found out that these courses were held by Robert Fripp. I was a big fan of his music. Then, finally, it became possible. It was only a five day introductory course in the states in West Virginia. So, I got on a plane and went there and it all started and began for the three of us as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;HM: How do I start it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Well, yeah a little introduction to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;HM: Okay, yeah. I’m born in Japan and raised in Japan and when I was a kid, like 12 years old, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ventures&quot;&gt;The Ventures&lt;/a&gt; (the instrumental surf band) in the states was very big in Japan. That’s how I imitate to start the guitar playing a Ventures piece because it’s all instrumental so you don’t sing it. That was fun. The Ventures, most of their pieces, the famous one, I copied it and then started listening to other bands, like the Beatles and many, many others. But The Ventures was the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;One interesting thing for me is the very first piece–from the time I learned my first piece–I still am playing it now. I’m wondering why, but it’s the music. It’s staying. What I played around that time and now, I still am playing. It’s very interesting for me. I still have some life. It’s not just playing old pieces, so that’s one thing I keep going. So even almost close to 50 years ago I was playing my very first piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Are you the one who’s brought in the surf and 60s influence into the band?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/3_Mu2CUrM2o?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;HM: Yeah. I could say that I think. Of course, people are suggesting to us to play other pieces, like Sleepwalk. I didn’t know it. It’s not famous in Japan, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah, The Ventures are awesome. They have a Christmas album that we discovered a couple of years ago and thought, “Why is this not a staple for everyone’s Christmas?” Great album. Really out of tune guitars. It’s great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Laughter.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;As you were talking about yourselves and how you met, it reminded me of my experience in the Guitar Circle introductory course. It was a life-changing week for me and clearly it’s a life-changing experience for each of you. What do you think transformed about yourself when you went through the Guitar Craft instruction?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PR: At the time I heard about the Guitar Craft course, I was only 20 years old, I think. I was studying–I was in the jazz guitar ensemble at the University of Utah and my teacher at that time just passed away yesterday so I’ve been thinking a lot about him–he was there with Robert Fripp and some other great teachers I had, like Kevin Johanssen. So that experience playing with the jazz guitar ensemble was great and it really helped form the things I’m doing now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Lights turned off again.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/SZiWvjRj1AY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So that experience of playing with the jazz guitar ensemble was important at that time, but I somehow knew that that’s not what I was going to end up doing. And then I heard about these Robert Fripp Guitar Craft courses. And another teacher of mine at that time, a guy named Don Ayers, he’s the one who encouraged me to go on my first level one course. I remember arriving at the mansion in West Virginia where these first courses were held and walking in the room and Robert Fripp is sitting in the corner and all the students were sitting on the ground and no chairs around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I immediately had a sense of peace come over me and I felt like, “This is the right place for me to be.” Even though I had no idea of what was going to happen. That whole week was very transformative. At the end of that week–I had this transcription of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discipline_(King_Crimson_album)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discipline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the King Crimson song Discipline that my teacher Don Ayers had made–and I wanted to show it to Robert to show what I’d been working on with my other teacher. Everybody was leaving the course and my time was running out. Then I went to Robert’s room and he was practicing his guitar and normally you don’t bother him when he’s practicing, but I knocked on the door and at first he was saying, “Don’t bother me. What do you want?” I said, “Oh it’s Paul, I have this transcription of Discipline.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;He invited me in and I sat down with him for a few minutes and showed him the transcription and he said, “Oh that’s very nice.” And then he said, “You need to come on the next Guitar Craft course next month!” And I was kind of in shock. I thought I was just going to do that one thing and then the idea that this was going to be a continual thing suddenly to happen for me. I went on the course the next month there and soon after that I was invited to England–to Robert’s house in England. Then everything changed in my life from attending those courses. It was huge. And what we’re doing now is all a result of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;BL: Right. Still riding that wave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Can you talk a little more about the transformation? For me, physically, back pain went away with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Technique&quot;&gt;Alexander Technique&lt;/a&gt;, the guitar technique completely changed, the way I pick, my relationship with the instrument… Can you talk a little about your experience coming from an electric blues background?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;BL: There’s so many different things, but I can relate two instances. While Paul was talking, it just came up. I was used to imitating. The way I learned was listen to something that I really loved and then pick up all the details. Blues music was perfect, you know? The bending strings and stuff. And in classical guitar, the way I would learn a piece, I could read music, but the way I would learn a piece was to listen over and over again to something that I really wanted to play. And it’s the same with these two guys. We get the feel of a piece then it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But, when I went to that week, the way I was used to having guitar classes or lessons was I would take jazz guitar lessons, for instance, with a man named John Thomas. He was a black guy, a really good guitar teacher. He teaches still at Berklee College of Music. I would go to his apartment. He was not–I would say he was not a great teacher, per se, but he could play really well and I would just bring my microphone and ask him to play Autumn Leaves, whatever, any standard that would be amazing. I’d take it home and then I’d assimilate. Pick it up and say, “Oh I like that.” Pick it up, imitate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And then I went to the Guitar Craft courses with the same thing. I brought my little tape recorder and my cassette recorder and I was ready to record anything I could, pick up all the exercises. I had no idea what was going to happen, so I did it the same way. I remember there was a big inaugural meeting, as you remember, with all the students there and Robert would ask everybody to introduce themselves and everything. I was recording everything. [Laughs.] Also, I didn’t want to miss anything. My English was not as good then and I wanted to take it home and listen to what he said in case I missed something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/6JTL3uxSYhI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Somebody noticed I was recording and told Robert and when I had my first personal meeting, right after, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Robert pulled me aside. He was really nice, he wasn’t like, “Bootlegging!” He was saying, “Well, you don’t need to do that. Just listen with your heart,” he said.&lt;/span&gt; I was like, “Oh, okay.” And then in one of the first personal meetings I had a question for him because I was teaching full time at that time and I asked him, “How can I apply…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Lights off again.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;You have to stand up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Laughter.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, in one of my first meetings with him, I asked him, “How can I apply this–what’s happening here to my teaching and to my students?” Because I was teaching full time. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;He said, “When you teach with love, everything’s going to be okay.”&lt;/span&gt; So he gave all these answers from his experience and that really turned me inside out. He wouldn’t have to think about some answer, something smart. It was just from his experience and I think that was a big thing for me to get that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: How about you, Hideyo?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;HM: Oh, well, after teaching myself, I formed a band with my friend playing The Ventures style as a local group. I formed a band and played in little clubs in Japan and decided to keep going so I decided to come to the States to study. After that, I didn’t have any official teaching about the music. So, I went to Berklee College of Music and I was pretty bad. A bad student. Really bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: A bad student? A bad player? Or both?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;HM: Could be both. [Laughter.] Compared to the other students, amazing students and people there. But also, something in Berklee and I didn’t get along, I didn’t agree with it. You know, rock is not a style, but it’s said there are styles of rock, but the music is very analyzed, I think. It doesn’t have much–something is missing in what I learned from Berklee. My friend was telling me, “If you like to play rock music, why don’t you go to jam?” I was thinking about the next move and I found Guitar Craft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Robert was my hero with King Crimson. So I decided to go and take a Guitar Craft course, but before I knew it was only a 5-day course. Five days of what? I didn’t know what they were doing in the five days. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;For a long time, I stayed at Berklee. About two years and I still was getting nothing. What can you do with five days?&lt;/span&gt; And I don’t speak good English, also. And also I learned Robert’s philosophy behind what he’s doing and Robert went to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_G._Bennett&quot;&gt;Bennett Institute&lt;/a&gt; in England. Guitar Craft course was held in West Virginia, which was doing continuous education. So, I took that course before going to a Guitar Craft course to be familiar with myself with those ideas. For me, that was more shocking. That was more changing my life in a way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Learning about yourself?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;HM: Learning about myself in the course. I don’t want to get into too much detail because I can’t explain those philosophies and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gurdjieff&quot;&gt;Gurdjieff&lt;/a&gt; works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;BL: You were there for three months or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;HM: Yeah, three months. Three months and then the head of that school told me to do it another three months. So I took another course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PR: Six months!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Laughter.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;HM: Because the first three months was very good, but the next three months was getting a little bit, you know… Getting more–ego was coming out, I guess. Whatever. Anyway, so the Guitar Craft was, in a way, shocking but not like what I had in Claymont.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PR: So, just to wrap that transformation thing up, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I think for us the transformation became our way of life and the way that we work together.&lt;/span&gt; It’s a little bit hard to talk about because it’s a normal thing for us now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Of course. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/SV6l8U9GfOU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PR: The way we learned to work together on the Guitar Craft courses was one of the things that propelled us when we started playing together as the California Guitar Trio. We had this whole way of doing things already set up and the way that we worked with Robert and the League went immediately into the way–in everything. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;The way we played our guitars, the way we listened to each other, and even when we were staying at Bert’s house in Hollywood during those first years, we tried to apply the Guitar Craft principles that–we were doing morning sitting and all those things that were the Guitar Craft ways of–and we took turns preparing meals. It was kind of an extension of that transformation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: That’s really awesome. So speaking of transformation, it used to be that you would sell CDs. [Laughs.] And you’d make money selling CDs and merchandise and touring. Now, that leg of the tripod of support as a musician is going away. I bring this up because I’ve seen Paul pretty active on Anil Prasad’s Facebook threads about this. So, I wanted to get your take on how the band has survived because I don’t think many bands can survive for 27 years. Especially not as a major act. So, could you talk a little bit about how you’ve seen the band shift and how you’ve been able to manage and maintain yourselves over all this time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PR: We made our first demo CD back in 1991 and I remember the first gigs that we played when we had the CD. We sold–we were selling quite a few CDs at shows then and I remember after the show, we would all gather and maybe the gig money was a little bit of money, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;but the CD sales–we would lay it out on the hotel bed or something, divide it up in to three, and we were so excited. We had this money from the CD sales! For years that continued to support our work. In fact, when we toured with King Crimson in those 130 concerts, we did not receive any payment for the shows. The only way that we supported ourselves was through CD sales after the shows.&lt;/span&gt; Robert was encouraging us to go out to this CD table after and sign CDs and meet the people, which is funny because he never does that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: That’s ironic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PR: Yeah. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;So we paid for that entire tour with the CD sales and then we had various record deals.&lt;/span&gt; We had a record deal on Robert’s label for quite a while, which was very good, and also with Inside Out Record Label. And now we still have some distribution through Inner Knot, which is also part of Discipline Global Mobile. So we still have a little bit of that, but you’re right, the CD sales are dwindling. Like, we never know now at shows if we’re going to sell any CDs. One night, we’ll have–maybe we’ll sell three or four CDs and then the next night, we’ll be surprised and we’ll sell 50 or 60.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So it hasn’t gone away completely at our shows. And our audience is, you know–most of the people are probably 30 and 40 and older. People younger than 30 don’t even know what a CD is and have probably never bought one. One of the other things that was really great was we went through maybe five or six years where we were recording all of our shows and we had a CD burning duplication tower that we brought with us. We called it our ATM machine because we would sell, you know, a lot of them after the show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Now, even just on these last few tours, we had one night in Bainbridge, Georgia where the audience was very small, but everybody in the audience bought a CD. Then the next night, the place was packed in Tifton College. Yeah, at a college place and we sold hardly any CDs. So, it’s now at the point where we can’t really rely on the CD sales from the shows anymore. And the CD sales through stores has gone away. We have a little bit of online distribution and we have our own web store where we sell a few. We sell a few things through iTunes, so that’s still a little bit there, but it’s changed dramatically now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;As Anil says, the thing that musicians need to do is find a way of doing different things.&lt;/span&gt; Offering different sorts of things that people are still interested in buying. And that seems to be one of the keys that we can do now. This is an ongoing discussion that we have a lot on tour. What are the things that we can do now? As far as the streaming goes, the one redeeming thing for California Guitar Trio is that California Guitar Trio is very popular on Pandora radio. We, over the past few years, have received over 60 million plays. From those plays, we do receive some money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;BL: We own our copyrights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PR: Because we own the copyrights, because we’ve set everything up to maximize how much money we get from streaming. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;From 60 million plays, we probably have received 50 or 60 thousand dollars&lt;/span&gt;, which is–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/3w3fD54bNvU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PR: Something. It’s not nothing. So, that’s just how it is now. We know from Pandora Radio, we get a little bit of money. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;But the problem with the streaming is that royalty rates are so low that 60 million plays–it should be way more than $50,000 or $60,000.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: And Pandora’s more generous than Spotify. 60 million plays may be a few thousand dollars now, the way the rates have been declining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PR: Yeah, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;so the main problem with the streaming is the rates are way too low.&lt;/span&gt; In the old days, when people sold–if they had a single that sold 60 million singles, that was–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: You’re set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PR: That was a fair amount of money. And for those musicians that don’t have their own copyrights. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;For musicians that are signed with a record label on some deal where they signed away their copyrights, those are the guys that you see on Facebook that say, “I had this song that had a million plays on Spotify and I got $13” because the songwriting portion of the royalty–it’s already so small and then the songwriting portion is the smallest percentage of that. The percentage that gets paid to the artist, you know? There’s different scales of nothingness that artists are paid. And fortunately, we took Robert Fripp’s advice when he told us to never give away our copyrights.&lt;/span&gt; We had some good offers along the way. We could have had some great record deal. We were offered a deal on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Glass&quot;&gt;Philip Glass&lt;/a&gt;’s record label.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;BL: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonesuch_Records&quot;&gt;Nonesuch&lt;/a&gt; [Records].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PR: Point Records on Nonesuch. It was like a dream come true to get that offer. We sent the contract to Robert. He said he would read through it for us. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;He got to the point that–the paragraph that said that they keep our copyrights in perpetuity for forever. He wrote, “Fuck you,” in the column.&lt;/span&gt; Told his assistant to rip it up and send it back to the record label, which she didn’t do that. But, she sent it back to us. So somewhere we have a box somewhere with this contract that Robert Fripp wrote “fuck you” in the column.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;BL: &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;“Sit on a pointed stick” was another one. He would write it and sign it, next to it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Sit on a pointed stick?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;BL: Signed RF. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Laughter.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: That’s incredible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PR: &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Yeah, so that was great advice, which is helping us now to this day because without that we would be one of the guys that says, “I have 60 million plays streaming and we only got $100,” or whatever. Fortunately, we’re not that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: So, what are some of these options that you guys are offering that help differentiate your revenue away from CD sales?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;BL: I think for us, it’s still the CDs because people are moved by the concert and they want a token of the concert. And right now, I think it’s still a CD. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;They want something that we sign. They like us to be there and say hello.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PR: That’s still going away, though. It might be just a few years before…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;BL: Yeah, maybe a year, another year I think we’ll sell more CDs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PR: One thing that we’re talking about is finding a new way to do the concert recordings because that was such a great thing for us and people loved to buy the concert that they just heard. So, we’re talking about the idea of recording the concert and then immediately, when we get back to the hotel room, we upload it and at the show we can sell download cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Oh yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PR: So, maybe in the next few months, we may get that going. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;So that’s the main thing that we’re looking at doing now. Selling downloads of our live show that same night.&lt;/span&gt; Have it uploaded relatively quickly after our shows. So that’s one of the things. We’re doing other things. We have t-shirts and other merchandise. We’re talking about other merchandise ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;BL: Our audience kind of wants to buy our music, it seems like. We’ve tried the t-shirts. They buy t-shirts, but–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Like sheet music? Or the actual recorded music?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PR: No he’s saying we’ve always sold more CDs than we have sold other types of merchandise, which is true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;BL: So I think the live shows will be a good thing if we can package it right. That’s kind of key so people have some kind of token that we sign. We tried the USB sticks for a while. It didn’t work because you get this little USB stick and it’s not…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PR: And then the USB duplicator failed several times and we had a line of people that all bought the show. It was too stressful for us. So this download idea may be more better for us than–yeah. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;But the main source of income for us is our shows and that’s why we’re touring a lot.&lt;/span&gt; Shows like tonight at this amazing venue, the Musical Instrument Museum, that’s how we can survive. The good thing is that we’re able to keep busy enough that we can just–none of us are getting rich doing this, for sure. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;And the months where we don’t have many shows, where we used to have CD income, this is a difficulty for us.&lt;/span&gt; So we need to figure out–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Patreon, right?! [Laughs.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PR: There’s Patreon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;BL: Patreon?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4HqFdQEK6_o?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PR: Patreon is the subscription service where people pay a monthly thing. The thing with Patreon is that you need to be good at developing lots of new content and people like Nora Germain and &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/julie-slick&quot;&gt;Julie Slick&lt;/a&gt; are young and they are good at that. She’s good at developing new stuff. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;The three of us–we’re not quite as enthusiastic about trying every week doing a new video and doing something new.&lt;/span&gt; So, I think Patreon is great and there’s a lot of people that seem to be able to get it, but I’m not sure that’s a way for the three of us to Hideyo to do another video, you know? Or something that we can get onto Patreon to get people interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;The other thing is &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;we’re trying to think about the way we release music in a different way now.&lt;/span&gt; Instead of waiting until we have a whole album, we may start releasing things as singles or doing an EP because the three of us live in different cities, it takes us longer to make a new album. We have three or four years in between each official release, but now we’re already working on–you’ll hear some things at the show tonight that will be on our next album, or somehow released in the meantime as a way to generate interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;The main thing that’s important for us now is to keep the interest level up for the people that are coming to our shows and finding ways of developing new people to come to our shows but also the people who are big fans.&lt;/span&gt; Over 27 years of time, we’ve played for a lot of people, so we need to find ways of keeping all of those people interested and also developing–continuing to develop a new audience. So, all of these things–doing releases, we’re doing a video, the next week we’ll be in Los Angeles and we’re working with these friends of ours that like to make videos and we’re doing another video with them. And doing this interview with you. All of these little things that help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;BL: We keep busy individually, too, which is nice. Paul is doing his photography, he’s coming out with a new–it’s on your website with all the prints. He’s taking great photos, mostly nature photos I would say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PR: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;BL: So he’s going to release that and it’s really worth releasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: That’s awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;BL: We’re each doing things when we have long breaks. I like to keep playing live. That’s my big joy, so I play house concerts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Oh yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;BL: So I do different little projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/xdEAccE7BMs?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PR: Like Fabio and Tom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;BL: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mittinolams.com/&quot;&gt;Fabio Mittino&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thossounds.com/&quot;&gt;Tom Griesgraber&lt;/a&gt;. I like to do that. I might go back to teaching a little bit, but when we have these breaks, I think we need to–we’re looking at other things of developing ourselves, individually and doing things and then bring that back to the group, which is great when we come back together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah, the hardest part to me is what Paul’s referring to. You’re no longer just a musician. You’re a brand. You have to market yourself. You have to constantly provide new content and if you don’t, the algorithms shove your content down way, way down in somebody’s feed and they never see it. And you’ve got, you know, 20,000 followers but 300 views. It’s becoming impossible to just be a musician.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;BL: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PR: Yeah, yeah. And &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/nora-germain&quot;&gt;Nora Germain&lt;/a&gt; is really good–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: She’s so good!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PR: At that stuff. I talk to her a lot about this stuff. She’s kind of a consultant in a way and I think she’s actually going to be doing more of that. Helping other people get good at what she is good at. That’s exactly this, about getting–&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;keeping the interest there and now where everything’s measured in plays and views. It’s a whole ‘nother world. And we’re still figuring it out!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And that’s one of the things I like about reading Anil’s comments and posts because I think he does have a good insight into things that are changing. He’s offered a lot of suggestions, even to California Guitar Trio on things that we could do, different musicians we can do projects with, different ways to keep going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PR: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Well, thank you so much for taking the time. How much more are you touring on this particular leg? Are you doing the southwest?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PR: Tomorrow we have to get up early to drive to San Diego, where we have a Sunday afternoon show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;BL: In a church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PR: In a church. Yeah. So we’ll be in San Diego tomorrow night. Then we go to LA where we have a couple of days before our show there on Wednesday. We’re playing at Herb Alpert’s Vibrato Club in Belair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Cool!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PR: So it’s a fancy gig there. During our days off, well not really days off, but we’ll do some rehearing and do some more filming for this video that Jill and Gary Banfield are helping us do there. And then we have a one-week break and then we go to the midwest for about two weeks. Tour in Michigan, Indiana–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;HM: That’s a tough one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: That’s a tough one?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;HM: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Why’s that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;HM: Because almost every day we play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PR: Every night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;HM: Every night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PR: Yeah, which is also good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: You drive between every gig–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PR: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: So a lot of travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PR: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;BL: In fact, this tour has a couple of breaks, but it’s going up to mid-April. It’s all one long tour with short little breaks. To me, it’s like one long tour through mid-April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: You’ve released 16 albums, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;BL: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Is there another one coming soon this year?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;BL: Hopefully, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PR: We have a good start on it, but it takes us a while to get enough material for a full album, so that’s one of the things we’re talking about doing. Different ways of releasing things. We have a good start on that. We have a lot more touring scheduled throughout the year. Our agency, SRO, is great in helping us keep busy. But they handle everything that has to do with setting up the concerts and all the contracts for that, but we do everything else. We are our own management, we are our own promotion team, and so when we’re not on tour, that’s the thing that we’re working on. Getting things set up for the next tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I’m recording sound clips on Pandora–that’s one of the things that they offer now. Artists can record a clip that goes out to the listeners and you can specify who hears the clip and on Spotify and Pandora and–they have things that they make available for artists. So this is the good side of the bad side. They do have some promotional things that help artists. But we do all of–we book all our own travel, we–Bert and I drive the van. Hideyo used to drive, but he doesn’t anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;BL: He’s the navigator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/gtlTvW_WnAk?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PR: He’s the navigator. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: So for people who want to learn more about California Guitar Trio, and who want to support you, what are the best ways to find out more and what are the best ways to support you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PR: Come to our shows. Go–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Lights turn off again.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: I’m doing the hokey pokey and it’s not even working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PR: The best ways to support California Guitar Trio are: go to our website and sign up for our email list. We send out an email, maybe once a month, not that often so we don’t bombard with emails. And come to our shows and buy our music. Even if it’s not a CD, we have downloads and we have other ways of buying music. Signing up for our email list is the best way to find out when we’re going to be in town again next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;BL: Yeah. The live shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;HM: Yeah, live shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PR: The live shows are what we have now, which is great. It’s always been the focus for us anyway, so that part is only getting better. Like tonight, our first time playing at the Musical Instrument Museum, and it’s sold out. It’s likely that we’ll get invited back again. Across the country, we have things like that happening, so that’s great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Fantastic. Thank you again for your time. I really appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;BL: Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>iNFiNiEN</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;iNFiNiEN is a rock band based in Philadelphia making music for all the right reasons. They are passionate about music as art and have a huge variety of influences. Their music is fun, exploratory, dense, and beautiful. The band’s drummer, Tom Cullen, submitted their music to me via Facebook several months ago. When I finally got around to actually listening with intention, I came to realize what a talented group of people they are. I immediately knew they’d be a great fit for the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jordan Berger: Bass&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tom Cullen: Drums&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Matt Hollenberg: Guitar&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chrissie Loftus: Vocals and Keys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interview-video&quot;&gt;Interview video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/JTTRX8_lXBo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interview-transcription&quot;&gt;Interview Transcription&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[“If I Were a Song” excerpt]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Infinien is a really interesting rock band out of the Philadelphia area and I am really delighted that they’re here with me because it’s all I’ve been able to listen to in the last couple weeks. So, thank you guys for joining us today and I’m really excited to introduce your music to our audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MH: Of course! We’re happy to be here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;TC: Thanks for having us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CL: Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;JB: Yeah, man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah, of course. So, could you guys introduce yourself–names and what you play? And I’m most curious about your creative process because your songs are so interesting and they blend so many different styles and I really want to hear about your creative process for your songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CL: Cool. I’m Chrissie [Loftus] and I play keyboards and sing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MH: And I’m Matt [Hollenberg] and I play guitar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;TC: I’m Tom [Cullen], I play drums and percussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;JB: I’m Jordan [Berger], I play bass and sing some background vocals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Cool, so your creative process. Who wants to start?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;TC: I think…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;JB: It all started with a big bang, really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MH: Well, I guess the main thing to understand about the band is we’re all coming from different areas of music, stylistically. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;We started out the band as just an outlet for jamming and exploring with no agenda of making a band, really. We just liked exploring music together and it was fun for us to have an interaction&lt;/span&gt; with–just speaking for myself, I was thrilled to play with them because it was such a different thing than what I was doing at the time, which was more metal stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, I got to play all this clean, jazzy guitar style and that was just a totally fresh thing for me at the time. And then I think collectively, we got into the genre-busting music in the beginning. Obviously, we share a love of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Bungle&quot;&gt;Mr. Bungle&lt;/a&gt;. I think that’s pretty obvious to certain people that like Mr. Bungle. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_(Mr._Bungle_album)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;California&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is one of our all-time favorite records. It’s not directly an influence. We’re not trying to recreate Mr. Bungle, but just the spirit of adventurousness, free exploration, boundary smashing, off-the-wall. We love everything about the way they approach it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/tUOWTmOP4FQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;We got in some &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Zorn&quot;&gt;John Zorn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Chiefs_3&quot;&gt;Secret Chiefs 3&lt;/a&gt; and that world has a little bit of a quirkiness that we maybe wanted to smooth the edge of. So, we like having the soulful vocals and the deep harmony of sort of more conventional styles of music. Maybe not more convention, but more soulful kinds of music. So obviously we love &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanza_Spalding&quot;&gt;Esperanza Spalding&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiatus_Kaiyote&quot;&gt;Hiatus Coyote&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoeTar&quot;&gt;MoeTar&lt;/a&gt;, and those bands are kind of in their own world compared to Bungle and Secret Chiefs. I guess we’re coming from all over the map and &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;we don’t like any filler or redundancy in our songs, so by the time we’re all happy, there’s just this mish-mash of different stuff that’s very adventurous to listen to and kind of engulfs you in the sound&lt;/span&gt;. I think we’re just going for an immersive vibe with what we’re doing. I know that was a long answer, but that’s a big question. Just bear with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;TC: I would agree. I think our main objective is to sort of fuse all different influences to where–we love so many different types of music. Like Matt’s saying, we’re inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Davis&quot;&gt;Miles Davis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_Report&quot;&gt;Weather Report&lt;/a&gt;, and Mr. Bungle, John Zorn, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candiria&quot;&gt;Candiria&lt;/a&gt;, you know? When we create, a lot of it–that’s the concept, but the working process is probably like Matt writes material, Chrissie writes material	, and then we kind of write a song as a band based on those blueprints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MH: Yeah, that’s pretty accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;TC: If you listen close, you can tell the two different writing styles. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steely_Dan&quot;&gt;Steely Dan&lt;/a&gt; or–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MH: Steely Dan! [Laughs.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;TC: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_%26_Oates&quot;&gt;Hall and Oates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;JB: &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;We don’t sound like Steely Dan or Hall and Oates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;TC: I don’t know. If you listen close enough, you can sort of figure out who sparked the original thought for the tune.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MH: Right. And then there’s other tunes we all write together. Everyone equally. And all three modes kind of have different results, so the albums just end up being all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/S74hBpQZ6LU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;TC: I wrote this one song. So…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Which one?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;TC: Brand New.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MH: The first track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[“Brand New” excerpt]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah, that’s a great song.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MH: It was based on a rhythm Tom came up with and we all worked it out together in the room. That didn’t come from anybody, it was all working together. So certain songs, that happens. Other songs, Chrissie brings the whole thing and it’s a perfect chord progression and we just orchestrate that together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;TC: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MH: So there’s no song that’s complete that’s being brought in. It’s at a certain point and we build it together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CL: Yeah, I’d say that. I’d say it’s just–usually the process is however we’re going to express it, being the most honest with what we’re currently feeling or what we’re influenced by. That’s kind of why I think it sounds like there’s a lot of different influences just because &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;every day is a different influence and every day we’re listening to different types of music.&lt;/span&gt; There was a period where we were really getting into Indian music together. And then we found out about Ethopian music. “Oh shit!” And then everything just kind of builds on itself. It’s just honest expression, I think. That’s the best…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;TC: We move really fast. We’re always telling each other about new music that we discover. Being inspired and influenced by the most creative, newest, weirdest music keeps us on a roll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MH: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;JB: As far as my view on the process for us, it’s like we’ve said–a lot of writing comes from Chrissie, a lot of writing comes from Matt. Basically, a lot of the divide, or the separation, is Matt tends to bring in more technically-written instrumental lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MH: Yeah, that’s true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;JB: Sometimes some really active chord progressions. Chrissie more often than not will bring in a more chord progression and melody with some lyrics already written. Things like that. There’s been a couple of songs where I’ve contributed a section to, like one of Chrissie’s songs or I’ve contributed a section to a song where we were sort of all working on together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I feel that my role in the process is really more of an arranging kind of role and sort of more like, “Well here’s all these ideas, they’re all awesome. Let’s put them all together, let’s see what maybe needs to change to fit the other things that are happening around it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/cb-DseJ-s30?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CL: Or a cool chord progression, like the end of “Bottom of the Food Chain.” The ending is all [points to Jordan.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[The Bottom of the Food Chain excerpt]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;JB: Yeah, I’ve written some sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MH: Yeah, that’s an amazing chord progression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;JB: That’s on the new record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MH: It’s coming from everyone. Ultimately, everyone has something new that came completely from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;JB: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MH: The third record, especially, everyone has a voice on that and I think that’s why it’s all over the place, but it’s thematic because we play in a certain way together. So, the songs kind of have this thing that binds them together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;JB: Yeah, on the third record, if you look at the inside of it, it does break it down pretty cleanly as far as who wrote what, but also what’s interesting about the song that Tom brought in the basis for, that actually credits all of us including the original bass player. It’s a really old song. That song’s called “Brand New.” It’s the first song on our newest record. That one actually credits Justin Carney, the original bassist and he did some writing in the early stages of the band as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;TC: And Justin did, too, have the initial concept, which was cool. I remember he phoned me one time and I was–I had been playing in really obscure grindcore band called Heinous Anus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Laughter.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;TC: It was a great band. Legendary band.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MH: They were really great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;JB: They’re worth talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CL: It’s true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MH: They’re very good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;TC: Me and Matt collided in the metal world because his band, Cleric, at the time was doing insane shit. That was cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;JB: They still are doing really insane stuff. Cleric is awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;TC: I guess I had broken up with that band and I was just distraught. I was fucked up, you know? It was a bad period of my life. So I started rapping and making beats. I wasn’t playing music. And Justin called me and said, “What if we”–I was also going to jazz school, learning about jazz and harmony, and I thought all the advanced harmony was really dope, you know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, he was like, “What if we do a really low–something with a lot of power. Heavy funk. Metal, almost. Heavy funk metal and then just christen it with this nice keyboards, jazz harmony, female vocals,” and I was like, “Let’s do it.” So I packed up my cardboard box and I went straight to Philadelphia. I swear to God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MH: That’s amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CL: Yeah. [Laughs.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;JB: Everything except the cardboard part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CL: I know. I think that’s pretty funny, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;TC: This was years ago. But yeah, Justin Carney.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MH: Yeah, Justin Carney deserves a lot of credit because he–I didn’t understand any of these chords. He wanted to use these 5- and 6-note deep chords and use polyrhythm and he’s like, “The whole thing will just be, like, swirling, man!” And I’m like, “Yeah, that’s cool!” But I didn’t know anything about that. I didn’t go to jazz school. So he taught me all that jazz stuff and kind of formed the language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Then through jamming, we all were exploring it together. I don’t feel like I was–I just felt like I was along for the ride. I didn’t come up with the idea because I didn’t know anything about jazz when I was 19. Nothing. I was playing metal. That’s it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/WsPloykBpo8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: I think we’re making a lot of assumptions of the listener, so can you tell us a little bit about your band’s history and how many releases you have? What brought you together and what you’re up to now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;JB: Sure. We’ve released three–we have three releases. One is an EP, the original. It’s “How to Accept.” The first record that I was involved with is the self-titled, full-length album. It’s our first full-length album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CL: And the year, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;JB: Huh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CL: The year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MH: Oh it was 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;JB: Oh yeah, sorry. The original EP came out in 2006. The self-titled album is 2009. And we just put out our follow-up to that. It’s a full-length record called “Light at the Endless Tunnel” that came out last year, or earlier in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;TC: And then between those albums, we played all the damn time. Between the first two records, we played all the time throughout Philly. Basements, World Cafe, jazz cafes, metal gigs. It was tough for us because we were doing something that was totally different, yet somehow we were able, in our networking, to connect with bands that were partially like us. We’re so alienated yet somehow we were able to connect with these bands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/xl0xviYz3rM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But when we weren’t in the studio dropping albums, we were out on the road. We did three tours. We went to the midwest, down south–we did three tours. We covered a lot of ground. We never got to go out west. But, yeah man, we’ve got tapes of us playing all this stuff live that we’re hoping to release. We just stayed busy. We constantly–the band’s history, too, we were always playing. We were real stern on rehearsing all the time. A couple times a week, gigging. You know, all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[“Love for Yourself” excerpt]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CL: We met originally with the bass player–that was 2004. Three of us were roommates–the bass player, Matt, and I were roommates with, like, eight other people. So there was always music going on of some sort. Usually it was hip hop because a lot of people at that time, it was in college. Other people wanted to rap, you know? But what happened is we just realized we were all in different bands, so let’s just make music together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And then I think the core, the three of us, realized we were kind of finding a voice that we hadn’t found in our other projects, so we just called Tom in and took it and just started experimenting. You know, sometimes with substances. [Laughs.] And each other, and just realizing that that was a lot of fun. Then we just started playing gigs as those came up. Mostly just playing and writing and having fun and being wild and allowing ourselves to be wild. Then Justin wound up moving to LA and he told us, “Get Jordan. This guy’s right on your level.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;JB: Yeah, Justin not only kind of helped them to stay together when they were first starting, as Tom was mentioning, but his last contribution was to recommend me, which seems to have worked out pretty well. At least, speaking personally. I’m still thrilled after all these years. I knew Justin through school. We were actually schoolmates studying basically on the same track of Temple University’s jazz studies program. We were both upright bass players at the school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CL: And I was there, too. So we were all in the same music school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;JB: Yeah, Chrissie was at Temple as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CL: It makes sense that we would have–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;JB: Matt was at Temple for a week, but that’s a different story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/8L8IfJlgarA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CL: But that’s where I met him and we kind of opened each other’s eyes to different types of music and we realized that was–we were kind of both geeks in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MH: Yeah, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;meeting Chrissie was way better education than the actual teachers there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: So it sounds like you guys have a mission of blending as much music as possible and that’s, to me, very evident on the third album because one song, “Oasis,” I don’t know who wrote that song but it’s a work of genius. [Laughs as everyone points to Chrissie.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/u9iCmqCBXB0?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CL: Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: That’s an incredible piece of music. And then, like, two or three tracks later, it’s like all of “California” from Mr. Bungle without any of the cartoon-y sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MH: Right. Well, that’s kind of what I was saying. We kind of smooth the quirkiness a little bit. It’s more beautiful than quirky and off-putting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: But then there’s another song where Chrissie is singing Indian melodies with very fast stepping between notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[“Light at the Endless Tunnel” excerpts]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MH: Oh yeah, yeah. You know, that song was really influenced by that–you know that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consider_the_Source&quot;&gt;Consider the Source&lt;/a&gt; band?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Oh, they’re awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MH: Yeah, we toured with them our first tour and me and Gabe [Marin] go all the way back. He’d just tell me about scales. So that song is just based on this one Indian scale that’s their version of pentatonic. The whole song is that scale, so it’s kind of like our version of a raga or something, mixed with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Glass&quot;&gt;Philip Glass&lt;/a&gt; or something totally not related to that. But that was totally influenced by Consider the Source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Okay, that makes sense. All right, so–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MH: You kind of hear their influence in “AYA” a little bit in moments. We play more chords than they do, so that would be the biggest difference, but yeah we really like them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: What’s next for you guys? Tom, I think, mentioned that you’re in the studio. What’s going on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MH: We’re just demoing new tracks that we made, but we don’t have a concrete plans as of now, but we have another record written. So, we’re just in the process of figuring out what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/nPg12O61Etk?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;TC: Yeah, if anyone’s been paying attention to the videos we’ve been releasing online, some of them have the full show of the last couple of shows that we played and there are some songs that are not released on the third record, sort of implying that there is more to come. It’s always a good time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: So, I mentioned earlier, I took my daughter to Costco today and we were listening to your album and I said “What did you think of that?” And she said, “It was weird,” which I think is perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;TC: That’s fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: But I want to know, as a band that is really focused on “new” and “different” and “mish-mash”–these are all terms I’ve heard many times so far–how are you reaching audiences and how are they receiving what you’re putting together?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MH: I think since the third record, we’ve been amazingly well-received. We went down to North Carolina in September and played &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.progday.net/&quot;&gt;Prog Day&lt;/a&gt; and we sold out of all our CDs, we made a ton of money in merch. Everyone rushed us after we were done. People talked about us on the message board, the word got out more, so that was kind of one of the biggest hitting-the-target moments we’ve had booking-wise. All the reviews have been incredible. So the word’s getting out there. It’s just us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;We’re strictly DIY. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;We don’t have a promotion team, we didn’t hire PR, we don’t have a booking agent.&lt;/span&gt; It’s just us and considering that, the album is standing on its own pretty well. I got a message from Italy the other day, this guy who’s just obsessed with it, he’s trying to get us over there. I don’t push us over there, it’s just getting around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;In the age of the internet and the sort of bleak musical economic environment, for a band like us, that’s a good sign. It’s a reason to be optimistic about the future, you know? We’re not making a lot of money, but our goals were artistic, not commercial, and I think we’re all satisfied in that way. And I think that’s what the band’s about. It’s not about what’s working right now in the industry, what’s selling right now, how many likes and followers we have. No, it’s about the record. It’s about the substance and I think that’s what we’re bringing that’s countering a lot of what’s going on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[“Worth the Wait” excerpt]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;TC: I’ll answer this with two answers. It’s difficult for us to attain mass appeal. We gotta understand that from the jump. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;But there are millions of people that like weird music.&lt;/span&gt; First thing we did when we dropped the album is we started contacting as many people as we could to get reviews. The reviews were outstanding. We couldn’t–I mean, people were just saying the most amazing stuff. It’s almost like–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;JB: We’re humbled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;TC: Yeah. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;We played last week and someone came up to me and was like, “You’re my favorite band.” I was like, “This is my favorite band!” I couldn’t lie. I was like, “When I go to sleep, I think of music that’s dope and cool.” This is what I imagine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;JB: That’s cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;TC: It’s been very well received to the right people. Mass appeal? No. But the people who do like this type of music will love it. It’s been a great year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;JB: Yeah yeah. So far, the internet’s been really nice to connect us and we’ve been getting a little bit more word of mouth spreading this year. It’s been fun. It’s been nice to see that we can put an album out and people are actually reacting to it. It’s not just like, “Oh, there’s another album on bandcamp,” you know? Everybody does that, and it’s important to do that because you’ve gotta make your stuff available however you can, but it’s nice to see that people are actually checking it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/5qY8arvbQCI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MH: Yeah, it’s nice not to be ignored because there’s so much out there and most stuff does get ignored. I feel like the people that are connecting with what we are doing, it really means something to them. And I guess for me personally, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;the low-to-the-ground approach is better in the long run because 5-10 years from now, you’ll still have those people whereas if you just make a catchy song and a million people get into it for two months, and then they leave, what did you really build there?&lt;/span&gt; It just seems like, “Let’s go up the roller coaster and get off.” I would want something more permanent than that. I like to think that we’ve attained that. I don’t really know, but…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah, I would classify your music as art. And that’s what I’m after. True artists who use music as their form of expression. So, it’s funny. Tom wrote to me months ago, I don’t remember–I think you just said, “Hey, here’s my stuff,” and I get a lot of those emails, but when I heard “Oasis,” I was like, “I gotta check this out later.” And when I listened with real intention, I was like, “Oh my goodness, these guys are awesome.” [Laughs.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MH: Thank you so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;JB: Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;TC: We really appreciate that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah, so what’s going on in 2018 for you and where can people find out more?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MH: Well, we’re &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=122617694436220&amp;amp;ref=br_rs&quot;&gt;on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, we’re &lt;a href=&quot;https://infinien.bandcamp.com/&quot;&gt;on Bandcamp&lt;/a&gt;, we’re exploring booking options right now, we’re demoing new stuff, there’ll be a new release sometime.. In the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: When it’s ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MH: Right, when it’s ready is the key there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;TC: But, way sooner than the other–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;JB: Yeah, there was a bit of a gap between the self-titled album and the “Light at the Endless Tunnel” unfortunately. But that’s definitely not going to be the case this time. We can say that for sure. We can also say the four of us are very committed to making this record better than the one we just put out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;TC: Yeah, that’s very true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;JB: We had the same mentality when we made “Light at the Endless Tunnel,” which was like, “We put our heart and soul into the Infinien record,” which is why we had to call it that. We couldn’t come up with a title because it was just like, “Well, this is everything we are,” so that’s why that record was self-titled. But I’m sorry, a little bit of a digression there. But, yeah, when we made the third one, it was like, “It has to sound better, we have to do this, we have to do that.” And it totally fueled us. We put together an orchestra. That was a weird dream–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CL: That was fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;JB: that we took into reality. All of a sudden we were standing–there’s a video of us online recording next to two enormous orchestra-sized harps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/aVuFmuShkyE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MH: Yeah, there’s like 4 harps on that track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;JB: And it’s real! Those aren’t fake instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MH: That was a total mission accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CL: That was so beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;JB: That’s also in the credits. You can see the list of orchestral players. I was lucky enough to play upright bass on that, too. Saved us a little bit of bread. [Laughs.] But anyway, yeah we’re very committed to making a new release that is even better than the third one, which we’re pretty happy with. All things considered. We can rest easy knowing that we made a really solid album. Or at least I can. Are you guys sleeping all right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;TC: This next album is–like I said, these guys are my favorite band and this next album is just so, so good. I don’t even know what to say. I’m excited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MH: There’s no album yet, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;TC: This year. Maybe not. I hope so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CL: I feel like one of the reasons why people who like it really like it is because &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;we’ve always been honest with ourselves and I think that maybe it’s not going to be popular, but it’s our truth and the truth is undeniable.&lt;/span&gt; So, when you’re honest with the way you need to express it, then somebody somewhere out there who’s gets it is going to get it. So, I feel like we can always be proud of what we’ve done because we’ve always been doing it honestly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MH: &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;We never did anything we didn’t want to do to get more people into the band. Ever. Everything was based on curiosity, exploration, innocence.&lt;/span&gt; None of us are innocent, but you know what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CL: &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I also feel like what I like so much about what we’ve found is that it’s a mix between chaos and beauty. I think that that’s the whole universe. Maybe that’s what weird music is. It’s not just beautiful, it’s not just chaotic, but it’s the blend.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MH: Yeah, I totally agree with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CL: It kind of captures you in all of your facets. You know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah, I would love to explore that chaos and order. That’s been a major theme going on the last few months in the philosophy I’ve been reading, but we don’t really have time for that. [Laughs.] So for anyone who’s new to you guys, what’s the best way to find out about you, find out more, and what’s the best way to support you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;JB: We’re on Facebook, Instagram, and all the recorded music is available to check out on Bandcamp and all of the other streaming services. Spotify, Google Play Music, Apple Music, Amazon. I believe it’s available. A friend of ours has a joke that you should have a t-shirt that says sorry I missed your gig. And there’s another t-shirt that says, “My music is highly available.” Anyway, Facebook is probably–between Facebook and Instagram is probably the best way to keep in touch as far as that goes. But, I’ve always said this to anybody who’s been interested in the band. Shoot us an email! It’s the band’s name at gmail.com [infinien@gmail.com].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MH: Yeah, we like hearing from people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;JB: We like people reaching out to us. It’s nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MH: It’s a core group of people right now, so it’s very community-esque. Don’t feel like we’re on an ivory tower. We love hearing from fans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;TC: Yeah and if you go to Bandcamp, you can find our whole collection. You can get our CDs, t-shirts, there’s some merch, a biography, and some stuff. If you want to see us, YouTube. We’re building our content this year, so expect more videos coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/6_frjTIDeZA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;JB: You keep mentioning “Oasis,” there is a really good capture of that song that we just released on YouTube through a company called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_Sessions&quot;&gt;Sun Sessions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: I saw it. It’s all solar-powered. That was so cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;JB: It is really cool!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[“Oasis” excerpt]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;JB: And then we just happened to be–it was the last hot day of last year. It was already starting to be a cold fall and then it was just this one day of abundant sunshine and it was like, “Jeez, it’s almost 80 degrees out.” It was kind of weird, so now we’re releasing in winter these sunny videos. But yeah, that’s a good capture of that. If you like that, there’s probably–a little bird told me there’s another one of those videos coming out soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Okay, cool. Thank you guys so much for your time. I really appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MH: Thank you so much&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CL: Thank you so much. I was going to say the best way to support us is what you’re doing. You’re spreading the word and you listen. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;JB: Keep making weird music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;TC: And hit us up on Skype! [Laughs.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JB: Thank you so much for having us. Infinien is a band we all believe in so dearly. We put so much energy into it and we just love so much that it is contagious. It seems to be, anyway. We just want to keep spreading it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>California Guitar Trio Plays Daydreaming By Radiohead</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cgtrio.com&quot;&gt;The California Guitar Trio&lt;/a&gt; performed a show at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mim.org&quot;&gt;Musical Instrument Museum&lt;/a&gt; in Phoenix, Arizona on February 24, 2018. Before the show, we spent about an hour talking and filmed a great interview, which should be online and available later this month. In the meantime, I wanted to release this beautiful performance of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiohead&quot;&gt;Radiohead&lt;/a&gt;’s song &lt;em&gt;Daydreaming&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is our first 4K video release, too. So, hopefully you high-fidelity video fans enjoy that! It’s still new to me, but I’m happy with how it turned out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;video&quot;&gt;Video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/SBW5DMA1rvU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here’s the original music video by Radiohead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/TTAU7lLDZYU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
