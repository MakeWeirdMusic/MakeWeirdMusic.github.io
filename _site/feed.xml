&lt;h2 id=&quot;interview-transcript&quot;&gt;Interview transcript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;Anthony: I remember I used to follow you on Facebook and then I stopped and then a friend of mine (Andy Kub) a couple years later said, “You should follow Jeff Berlin.” I said, “Okay, I’ll do that.” And I remember the reason I stopped following you was because it was almost like you were inviting controversy at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;Now, just recently, you do a public apology to Victor Wooten and Steve Bailey, you’re talking about huge personal transformation and growth. Was it primarily your ego getting out of control and then you had a self-realization event? What led to what you’ve been going through and how were you operating at the time before that and how are you operating now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Jeff: Thanks for asking that because for me, this is more important than maybe music is right now. I grew up in a dysfunctional family. I know a lot of us have. The way that I ended up was hurt, ungrounded, out of balance, and the ego compensated. I’m doing this in a nutshell. All my life, since I was 18 years old, I felt something was wrong with me. I started, actually earlier than that, it was 18 that I went to therapy. Things were not right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I noticed people seemed to be content, seemed to be grounded. You know, everyone has their problems, but I could not get a grip or a handle on how people kindly and calmly get through life. And I’ve been in and out of therapy, my own voluntary seeking of it, since I was 18 years old. I’m 63 now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;When I was 60, I was just in a period where I did a lot of my Facebook stuff challenging, not polite, very hard-edged–it was just a symptom of even the messages in my columns, in my interviews, how I may have interacted with people–it was all based in fear, all based in shame, it was all unhealthy and I could not resolve it. I tried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;When I turned 60, I fell apart. I literally lost my mind and felt that this is the end. I understood why people commit suicide. I understood it. People commit suicide, I feel, when they feel there’s no option or hope to extract yourself out of the awfulness, the hopelessness, the pain, the fear–when you’re in this, you can’t imagine, people who’ve been through this can–the awfulness, you get to think it’ll never end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I have a guitar player friend here in Clearwater who recommended somebody who I went to and I went when I was 60. In this time, she was wired differently, let’s say. I still see this person and she was a licensed therapist who renounced her license, not believing in therapeutic things (her thinking) and went into a kind of a spiritual bent and she kind of amalgamated a soupy spiritual thing with therapeutic things and came up with something where, instead of “my mother did” and “you, Anthony, said” and “Victor Wooten and Steve Bailey and all bass players,” instead of this, I went inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And man, let me tell you, nothing was harder than to do that. Nothing. Because now whatever was going on wasn’t your doing or your fault or how you’re doing or “you don’t understand.” I spent about 7 or 8 months on the floor of my house, crying, sobbing, shaking like I was in an Exorcist movie, buddy. I mean, it was murder because feelings that I had suppressed–I don’t know. It’s not like, “Oh Mom did this and she said that and this happened and she said and not this,” it’s that these things get internalized and they’re feelings so they started to come up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I was getting worse and worse and worse by each passing month. I would write to Beth because we have a communication relationship where I would see her and she would sit there and go, “Nope, you’re doing fine. You’re doing fine.” I said, “Beth! That ledge looks really good now, Beth!” “Nope, you’re doing fine.” And what she meant to say was that this was a passage where people often, in fear, don’t go through it all the way. I got on that train and I had to ride that train to its conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Ultimately, I felt–Can I tell you this? I felt on a Monday, I said, “Beth, it’s worse. I’m getting worse, Beth!” And I wrote her. She says, “Hang in. This is what you gotta go through.” Tuesday, I wrote her again because I was seeing her on Thursday or so. “I’m going crazy, Beth!” She says, “Nope, you’re doing fine. Hang in.” On Wednesday, Anthony, I was so bad I suddenly felt as if I hit bottom. I felt it. I physically felt hitting bottom and I went totally numb and I went, “What is this?” And from that moment, I started to get better. She said later, “You hit the bottom in this dark night of the soul (it’s called).”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I was into spiritual pursuit and people experience this where the essence of what we construct for ourself collapses. When it collapses, we collapse. If everything you, Anthony, believe in falls apart, what are you? You know what the answer is? Nothing! And that, what you are, you’re nothing in the sense of everything you have and everything you believe in, it’s nothing, it’s false, it’s not real…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;When that happens, what do you do? What do you trust? Who are you? What are you to rely on? And that happened to me, man… Talk about losing your essential self as a human being because that’s what happens to people like me in the dark night of the soul. What happens is this is a healing process and then as you come out of it, you reconstruct from another place, not a damaged place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;In the subsequent years, I would practice being nice. “Hi guys, I’m sorry I did this stuff.” Okay, three months later, “You know, you stupid idiots out there, you’re all…” And then I would catch on a couple months later and go, “Whoops, I’m sorry I did it again and I don’t know what happened. I feel so bad, I’m really…” And I did. I would work to be nice. “Hey Anthony! Hey! How you doing? Everything good?” You know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It wasn’t natural, but I did make the effort. And finally in December of this year (2015), I had another collapse. About a month before, I was dancing in Beth’s office, saying, “Man, I feel as great as I’ve ever felt.” And I did! I had this collapse and I said, “What the hell is going on here?” She said, “People sometimes get strong after their first diminished and long-term depression to be strong enough to experience the next stage in a collapse of something internal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And what happened here is I, for better or worse, even lost more ego ground. I feel it like talking to you now that what I’m discussing isn’t the ego part of me, which I recognize that sensation, and try and conscious–I’m conscious all the time. “Ah, there I am. I did this. I see.” The watcher part. I’ll give everyone a little test here to show you the different–if you’re interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Absolutely! I love this stuff!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: This stuff and the readings that I’ve done, the dark night of the soul, I’ve gotten videos from her about people lecturing on it, different aspects of spiritual growth. What is spiritualism? It isn’t [hands in prayer] “Ommm” or maybe it is! But, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the natural you. You without the pollution, the “You know what? I hate the Pittsburgh Steelers! I only love the Raiders!” It’s a construction, in a sense, and if I could do away with and appreciate the Raiders &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the Steelers, although I’d probably prefer one or the other, that the sense is that there is a more natural sense of me that should have been before I was hurt and deviated from a healthy growth path. My parents unknowingly did this…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Steve Vai had a great example for me. I’m sorry to interrupt. This has been so helpful. He said, “A lot of people are holding this jar and the jar is empty. Every life experience you have gets put into that jar, every opinion you have gets put into that jar. And people end up believing that they are the jar or the contents of the jar. But, you’re still the person holding the jar. You’re &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; that person that has these experiences. You are the person holding those experiences!” My boss said, “Just because someone makes you a crap sandwich doesn’t mean you need to eat it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;It’s kind of like: we have a choice of taking what’s in this jar and believing it’s us, or believing that we are the person holding the jar and that the jar and its contents do not define us. Other people, no matter what they stick in there, that doesn’t need to change who we are. We’re not in touch with being that person holding the jar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;Robert Fripp is all about this notion that we are–well, there’s a guy named Gurdjieff that he follows, this philosopher, and that most people are in a sleeping walking state, almost like zombies and we’re never truly awakened. So, all of this stuff has been so central to a huge transformation in my own life since September 2014. Just huge for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;The conversation with Steve and then the guitar camp with Robert Fripp and then all the other experiences and all the reading, so I’m glad I haven’t had a dark night of the soul, I’m lucky and very fortunate to not have had that, but those examples right there really feed into my understanding of what you’re talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: I think Steve nailed it and it’s true. I agree with him. I’ll give you a little example of the person you are rather than the person who thinks and this goes for everybody else. I’d like to do a little experiment and here it is. In your mind, say the word, “House.” Tell me when you did it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: In your mind, louder, say the word, “House.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: And the final one, in your mind, scream as loud as you can the word, “House.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: Here’s a question and I’m curious what you would say. Did you notice in all three experiences there was a part of you watching?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Oh yeah. Absolutely. The third one especially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: And this is an indication of something that I’ve been developing because in the sleeping mode that you’re discussing, many of us are sleeping and usually people that are highly opinionated, gossipy people, opinionated to the degree that I know I’m opinionated in music ed, opinionated for its own sake, which is what I used to be, are asleep. We are governed by the thoughts, not only the jar, but the things like, “I like this football team,” and, “Metronomes are bad.” Why? Just because I say so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: “The monkey mind” Fripp calls it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: The monkey mind! See, good for Fripp. I’m joining an elite club, and so are you I think. We like to invite people to join us. It’s a good thing, especially us being the sick or the damaged or the mentally unhealthy or the soul-spiritually-imbalanced people that are seeking and getting better. I never thought I’d find this kind of balance and now that it’s happening to me, I never thought it would come, man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, I just wanted to point out that in the development, we develop that watcher part and that’s when I began to see this ego part who went, “Ah well, Anthony… Weird! What a funny word. Anthony and his weird .com.” And of course, that’s not the watcher, the guy who screamed, “House,” perhaps. Or screamed “cookie.” That is, in a nutshell, what I am developing. It’s very important to me. I probably talked too much about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I don’t think so. To me, it’s the stuff of life and you don’t realize the value of it. Like you said, you don’t think you’ll ever get there, and then when you’re there you realize you could have had it the whole time. It’s not so distant, it’s not so hard, but we spend decades defending a worldview with rules and opinions and these kinds of things that we grow to believe, “These must be true!” And when somebody does something that violates some of the rules, or makes us feel jealous or something like that, it’s because we’re defensive. It’s our ego saying to us, “That person doesn’t live by your rules and that person is doing well.” You know? What’s wrong with &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;? Why can’t you do that? You know the rules. It’s been &lt;em&gt;hugely&lt;/em&gt; transformational stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: Yeah, and I appreciate that too. By the way, this probably should be a two-parter, shouldn’t it? Maybe a 5-parter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: If you need to get going, we can end it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: No! I’m happy to chat. It’s just I would assume a lot of this is going to make people go, “Oh yeah.” [Snoring.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I don’t know. The Steve Vai one, people are eating it up. They love the non-musical/musical context. A great exercise that I read about is if you envision in your mind a room with two doors. If you think of a difficult situation, something that made you upset, let that come in through one door. The two doors are on opposite ends of the room. Let it come in to one door and you visualize it and get a sense of what it is and it might look like colors, shapes, sounds, whatever. You watch it from a distance and you get to develop a familiarity with that feeling and you wait for it to leave out the other door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;If you do this mental exercise for long enough, these feelings that you get, these feelings of discomfort or ego or whatever it is, you start to train yourself that things enter and then they leave. You also teach yourself that you can have compassion for these feelings. And, when these things come up in your life, you teach yourself that they will leave, that it’s not permanent. “This feeling, I know what this feeling is.” As soon as you feel it, you know what it is. It’s this thing entering the door and you know what it looks like because you’ve studied it. And we spend so much of our lives avoiding these feelings, but…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: Which is what my dark night was. It was all my life avoiding things and you said you hope you don’t get it and you probably won’t. The dark night could be different. You could be just sort of depressed or just sort of down. Mine was an utter and absolute loss of self. That, for a highly egotistical being, loss of self is freaking terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, somebody like you, who I sense is a sort of a lower-keyed guy, if comes a time where your system decides to auto-correct, you may just sort of, “Man, I don’t feel so great.” And it won’t be as awful, but it is predictable. And you will emerge. And really, often, there’s nothing to do about it except recognize it. You said to, honor those parts that come through the door?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Have compassion for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: Have compassion for. That’s a good synonym for my world, which is “love it.” There’s a part of me that was so badly hurt that it caused the ego to say, “Well, I’m the best. If you don’t study like I say, you’re a doodoo,” which is an industry term for “poopoo.”” In my case, I’ve learned to love this injured part and I would embrace it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I actually gave myself permission recently, not terribly long ago, I made a declaration and it’s made a difference in my life, which is no matter what I feel, no matter how I feel it, I’m going to honor it and I’m going to feel it. I’m going to let it come and I’m never going to restrict or restrain. If I’m in the middle of a session, I guess I won’t pay too much attention, but later at the hotel, I will lay down and I’ll go back to that and I’ll bring it up. I’ll bring it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s that integration element that these things that were not known and not dealt with are now–okay, they come up and, “Okay, I feel this, oh my goodness yes, oh I’m so mad! Yes you are.” It sounds a little silly, but I feel a great deal of the ill psyche in me and I’m as grateful as can be, man. I’m really grateful. My bass playing is better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I was gonna ask that. Over the decades, how did your ego influence what you were playing and now that you know that feeling–you said you have a new awareness for when the ego pops in–how does that affect you as a musician and as a bass player?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: Well, I feel I’ve never played better and I feel that pretty much my entire musical career is a fraud. It’s a fraud in the nature of what I constructed it on. So, it’s an honest and, I feel, a true assessment. I agree I played maybe music that people may enjoy, but I played a lot of stuff that was, “Love me. Love me. Love me! Love me! &lt;em&gt;Love me!! Love me!!&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: All right, well, I’m gonna get rid of this then. [Holds up Bruford’s “One of a Kind.”]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: Well, that thing endures and I’m grateful for it, those Bruford things. That was the thing of this. I mean, “Love me love me love me,” fast, fusion, grrrr… And &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; I’ve found a whole new way to play bass. I’ve found other things. My playing isn’t as virtuosic because, quite frankly, I don’t qualify anymore. Not with Adrian Ferrad and that new young crew of firebrands around. You know, these guys are simply beyond belief! I’d be foolish if I were in my ego state, “All these young kids! I’ll show them a thing or two!” Which probably would have been my bent a while ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So now that I’ve kind of abandoned that kind of “need to” whatever, I’ve come 1. to love these guys and respect the living heck out of them, and 2. with a calmer nature as a bass player, I said, “Wow, look at this! I’m finding some interesting new things!” And so, it’s the liberation and allowing the spirit to flow and I never knew what spirit was and I guess I’m still not sure. I guess I take it to mean “the natural me.” What I was, as I said earlier, what I was meant to be. Yeah, my bass playing is satisfying. It’s great! It’s flowing out of me like juice out of a blood orange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Have you written any new songs since going through this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: Yes. Not a lot, but I have. I’m not what I would call a gifted composer. I’m more of a “worker at it” composer. Some guys have that gift. I’m sorta like, “Da da da da da da da.” No. “Da da da da DAH da da.” No. “Da da da da DAH da da da DAH da da.” Okay that one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Do you compose on the bass? I see you doing keyboard gestures. Do you write on the keyboard?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: Yeah, on keyboard and on bass. I write on both. I’m fortunate. I write a lot of nice bass things now that are slightly different. [Bass gesture] This is bass. [Keyboard gesture] This is piano. [Trombone gesture] This is slide trombone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: [Violin gesture] This is violin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: [Flaps arms like a chicken] This is wock-a-doo-wock-a-doo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Frank Zappa [hair curl gesture], this is reggae, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: Frank was an interesting guy, man! He’s a guy that I think would have benefited from spiritual pursuit. He had a lot of angst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: You played with him for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: I did and I got myself thrown out of a band through bad behavior. You know. And rude attitude. I’m telling you, man, I left bodies in the wake. It was a lot of humble pie. A &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of humble pie that I have to eat in order to own my thing and grow from there, so I’ve come to develop a rather appreciative taste for humble pie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So, you did lose opportunities as a result of this attitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: I lost them and I threw them away. I burned bridges. I was fairly out of my mind and fairly out of control. You can find a lot of that stuff on the internet. There’s not too much hidden evidence of that. You know what karma is? You’ve gotta pay the tab, man. You know the dark night? You gotta pay the tab. I put something out, I’ve gotta pay the bill for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And that &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; is in one way why I confess these stories and open up like that because I don’t want anything to be hidden, I don’t want to lie about anything, I don’t want to make one flipping excuse about anything in me that I’ve earned. So, I’m okay with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Good!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: You’re getting maybe more of a sense of the kind of guy, at least today, maybe in 3 months I’ll be different again because I feel calmer, I feel more loving, I feel more centered, more grounded, I still think music education needs fixing, I still think I need to practice my bass, I still think Victor Wooten and Steve Bailey are helping people and doing well for people and I owe them an apology and other people, if I’ve cast aspersions against them and all other teachers. I still feel metronomes don’t work, but if people wish to use them, of course they should, so I’m firm in my thing. Apologetic where it needs to be and I’m fine with it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Have you heard from any of these people that you’ve apologized to or you feel like in the past you might have wronged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: Give me a second, I want to answer. Not really. You know, I’ve apologized before and fell back, so I don’t think they’re wrong. “Here Berlin goes again, man. Apologizing and then the next thing he’s like, ‘Don’t slap bass! Don’t use a fretless!’ I’m not sure what.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Well, if I go through a dark night of the soul, your phone’s gonna ring at 2 in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: You can call any time and your dark night I’m fairly imbued with a little bit of an understanding of things. Again, that doesn’t make me anywhere qualified as a teacher or expert in any way, but I do have a sense of things now that I didn’t. If you do experience it, it will be a tolerable and less vicious form than mine because you aren’t losing a great deal of that collapse where you’re a more solidly-formed, emotionally-stable guy than I was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s like a house falling down, or the Empire State Building falling down, or (forgive me) the Twin Towers falling down. Bad analogy. It’s that collapse. That collapse was me and it was devastating. And then it was necessary. So you said, “I hope,” and it didn’t happen. You know what ironically happens to guys like me that go through it? We’re as grateful as ever for the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yeah, I bet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: I went through murder, man. Really murder. Hell. I thought thoughts. I said, “I can’t tolerate this. Bye world, I’m gone. Do it.” Something said, “I gotta get through this.” Beth helped me out, I read a lot of literature, I cried, I suffered, I shook. I apologized, “Oh what did I do? What did I say? What is this? What is this?” And finally it just began to ease up and now I play bass pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Well thank you so much for sharing this very human story. I really appreciate it and I think it takes a lot of bravery and candor and it’s really kind of you to offer this time and these words. So, thank you so much Jeff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: I’m honored to be here and thank you for the chance and the opportunity. I apologize if I talk too much. It’s actually something I’m attending to in my therapy. This need to just go blah blah blah bleh bleh blah blah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I love it. Don’t apologize. There’s no need. Thank you so much, Jeff. Maybe in a few months, we can talk again and see where things are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: I would like that. I would like that very much. I wish you well and hi to everybody. Thank you for listening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: All right, Anthony. Cheers, buddy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Thank you very much, Jeff.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Jeff Berlin Interview</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-context&quot;&gt;Some Context&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Part 1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; our interview with the incredible Jeff Berlin. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Part 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is coming soon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Berlin&quot;&gt;Don’t know who Jeff Berlin is? Check out his wikipedia page! &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeff and I connected via Facebook over some mutually-passionate comments regarding an obvious personal transformation he and I have both been going through. I was fortunate enough to get his attention through some comments and posts. After he watched some of our &lt;a href=&quot;/interview/steve-vai&quot;&gt;interview with Steve Vai&lt;/a&gt;, he reached out to me and tried arranging some time for us to get together at NAMM. All this happened in a matter of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, I was disappointed I couldn’t meet up with him at NAMM, however the resulting interview is so much better than I think it would have turned out if we tried talking amidst the chaos of NAMM. There are &lt;em&gt;so many&lt;/em&gt; deep and wonderful statements and interactions in this interview. I hope you get as much out of it as I have. Thank you for your attention!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This interview was conducted on Friday, February 5, 2016 at 2PM AZ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interview-transcript&quot;&gt;Interview transcript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;Anthony: Hi, this is Anthony from MakeWeirdMusic.com and I’m here with the incredible bass player, Jeff Berlin. Jeff, thank you so much for being with us today. I really appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Jeff: Well, thank you for inviting me. I always like these chats. It gets me a chance to open up interesting topics for old friends, people that know me, and possibly new fans that don’t know me and might want to know what I do and what I’m about. So, thanks for the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Thank you so much! One of the purposes of MakeWeirdMusic.com is to allow musicians and music enthusiasts to find out about new artists and to find out about new music, new techniques, things that make certain people unique. You certainly have a great history and I thought it would be great if you could introduce yourself and talk about that history. Then we’ll get to some of the meatier stuff that you and I have mutually wanted to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: I’ll begin by saying the title of your website, Make Weird Music–in regards to the “weird” part, you were thinking of me. So, I own the “weird” element as a person, possibly as a musician. I’m Jeff Berlin. That’s my name. It’s Jeffrey Arthur Berlin. Family and people I grew up with refer to me as Jeffrey. Everybody else refers to me as Jeff, which I find the more intimate and friendly interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Preferring one over the other, I like Jeff. It’s just more social. Jeffrey sort of makes me feel like I should probably get you a cup of tea and possibly, if you live out of the United States, a copy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pravda&quot;&gt;Pravda &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. You know, a butler element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I’m a bass player. I’m a fortunate musician. I’ve eked out a career, an international one, and have the &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; good fortune of playing really among the greatest musicians that ever played in several styles of music. So, that is a blessing to me. It occurs to me sometimes: why me? Why did this happen? I’m very grateful for this life in music. And that’s what I do. I’m a bass player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;on-the-violin&quot;&gt;On the violin&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: How did you get started with the instrument? I know you were playing violin as a child. Something like that…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: All Jewish children in the 50s that exhibit–let’s say a natural propensity for music–inevitably are guided by their equally and possibly more strict Jewish parents to pick up a violin or a piano. It’s hard to find a Jewish trombone player in the world. I think that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Milstein&quot;&gt;Nathan Milstein &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Stern&quot;&gt;Isaac Stern &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itzhak_Perlman&quot;&gt;Itzak Perlman &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will sort of relate to the Jewish-ness of the classical instrument (violin) that we were encouraged to play if we exhibited music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/0d4XtOrs7xc&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And I do acknowledge this: certain people may be sports-motivated. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods&quot;&gt;Tiger Woods &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; exhibited a genius for golf as a child. He actually appeared on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Carson&quot;&gt;Johnny Carson &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;’s show &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wHkA_983_s&quot;&gt;as an unknown kid &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; who had genius in that. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I wouldn’t say I had genius, but I did have a natural musical propensity.&lt;/span&gt; I sang Italian songs before I could speak English. You know, &lt;em&gt;speak&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And how that happened was my father was an opera singer and when he sang these songs and repeated and repeated them, I would sing, [sings in falsetto in Italian] and we have a film–not a film, a recording of it somewhere in the family where I was 9 months old singing Italian songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, “we gotta get this boy a violin.” I began on violin and as much as I wasn’t really into it emotionally, I have to say it was probably the greatest foundation of music to help me prepare for the career that subsequently ensued. So, I am grateful for my mother and father having not pushed, but gently coaxed, gently shoved, encouraged, “Come on, son” … “I want to quit” … “I know, just do this and I’ll get you a gift.” They blackmailed me in a positive manner. They were smart. And I played violin until I was basically 16 and then I stopped altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;on-the-bass&quot;&gt;On the bass&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: And then how did you get on to the bass?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: Oh, well that’s right. When the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatles&quot;&gt;Beatles &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; came to America, I saw the very first performance. I saw it on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ed_Sullivan_Show&quot;&gt;Ed Sullivan show &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. There was a kid in our neighborhood, he came out and said, “The Beatles are here.” I’d never heard of them. He said, “They’re playing tonight.” I said, “Who are these guys? What is this?” And I watched them and wasn’t impressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/JC0MEF6d1eU&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I was 11 years old, I imagine, or 12. I can’t recall. And, you know, “What’s this?” It wasn’t &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyotr_Ilyich_Tchaikovsky&quot;&gt;Tchaikovsky &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I wasn’t moved. Ironically, I would say, not terribly long later, I was not only smitten, bitten, and knocked on my backside by these guys, but &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;when I listened to the records, I knew I &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to do this.&lt;/span&gt; It was inevitable that music had to figure into my life, not in the symphonic manner, which was probably the career that I may have been guided toward, but by picking up an instrument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I didn’t pick up a guitar because the bass is tuned like a violin is, except in opposite intervals. A violin from low string to high string is tuned in 5ths: G D A and E. A bass is tuned from low string to high string in 4ths: E A D and G. So, the associated names were exactly the same and my thinking is, “If I can get through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin_Concerto_(Mendelssohn)&quot;&gt;Mendelssohn violin concerto &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I’ll learn this bass in two weeks.” And that was my childish egotistical arrogance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I quickly did learn the bass, probably in ways that people didn’t really wish for me to do because I would be hired to play in bands and then get fired from bands because I didn’t groove and I didn’t know what a rhythm section thing was. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;It didn’t interest me as much as playing the solos on bass that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Clapton&quot;&gt;Eric Clapton &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; played on guitar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I played the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_Road_Blues&quot;&gt;Crossroads &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; solo I guess when I was 16 or 15 or something, and would play &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream_(band)&quot;&gt;Cream &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; solos, Beatles melodies… &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I wasn’t driven toward the rhythm or the bottom of the bass, but rather toward the top.&lt;/span&gt; And I suppose it went hand in hand with the violin training that I had done, which is the violin is intrinsically a melodic instrument, so I put that in and didn’t quit understand. “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Jamerson&quot;&gt;Jamerson &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;? Yeah, it’s a nice bass line, but listen to–” you know… “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Son_of_a_Preacher_Man&quot;&gt;I’m the son of the preacher man &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.” I think that was Jerry Cogbill–Jerome? [Sings and scats] [NOTE: it’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Cogbill&quot;&gt;Tommy Cogbill &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/0vR9d--Zk-U&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Now I’m excited as all get out by these bass players. Back then, I wasn’t interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;influences&quot;&gt;Influences&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: You obviously don’t play music that’s like the Beatles anymore. A lot of your music is very jazz-oriented and there are some fusion releases you’ve done with a few bands. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Henderson&quot;&gt;Scott Henderson &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Chambers&quot;&gt;Dennis Chambers &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;–that album is incredible. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruford_(band)&quot;&gt;Bruford &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; stuff. Can you talk about how you got into jazz and fusion and rock?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/wNCSTNHejAY&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: Yes. My initial influence was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Bruce&quot;&gt;Jack Bruce &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. When I heard Cream, the studio records were enjoyable. The live records &lt;em&gt;slayed&lt;/em&gt; me. When I heard those live jams, including (I might add) &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginger_Baker&quot;&gt;Ginger Baker &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;’s drumming… To me, Cream most affected me via Jack Bruce’s–I would call “original.” I don’t think it’s a stretch. One of a kind. Original and utterly unprecedented bass playing. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;He, for me, is the first virtuoso on my instrument in history.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Ginger Baker also, ironically, is a little bit maligned these days due to the “beware Mr. Baker and his rather curmudgeonly attitude.” Let me tell you: be that as it may, when you listen to those earlier Ginger Baker recordings, you will hear a drummer with an utterly original tone and an utterly original approach. His thing was &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; original that I was flabbergasted. Although I wanted to be a drummer, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I still wanted to be Jack Bruce more than I wanted to be Ginger Baker.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But it’s really about having this opportunity. I wanted to just make a statement that this, at one time, Ginger was considered the greatest drummer in the world. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvin_Jones&quot;&gt;Elvin Jones &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and his area of music, of course, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Blakey&quot;&gt;Art Blakey &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, all these guys. But in rock, Ginger was it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Okay, enough of that. So, this influenced me. Going a long way around the barn to answer your question. I got into Jack, learned about virtuosic stuff, went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berklee_College_of_Music&quot;&gt;Berklee &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when, at the time, I felt that Berklee was entirely a school focused &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; on musical content. In the era that I went, we had ear training, bass lessons, harmony classes, arranging, composing, line-writing. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herb_Pomeroy&quot;&gt;Herb Pomeroy &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; line-writing, which people still state is the greatest original melodic musical writing class ever. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;And the school at that moment was only interested in educating in musical content with no other distractions.&lt;/span&gt; I learned from that and it actually put me on the path of music education that I’m on today and put me on the path of understanding music from an academic point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/lYBDRBnpF5I&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;building-a-career&quot;&gt;Building a career&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Again, a long way around the barn, I got out of school, I went to New York, I became a successful studio bass player and I’d go to the union, pick up my union checks for beer commercials and pantyhose commercials that I’d played bass on and all kinds of stuff, and–while you smile–the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brecker_Brothers&quot;&gt;Brecker Brothers &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were sitting next to me playing the horns on those same pantyhose commercials. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Gadd&quot;&gt;Steve Gadd &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was playing drums on them as well. So, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Rosengarden&quot;&gt;Bobby Rosengarden &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;–you know, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dick_Cavett_Show&quot;&gt;Dick Cavett &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; drummer. It was a slew of the crew of the greatest New York musicians. And I was in that mix because I could read music and I was considered an over-player being a young hyper kid. Psychologically, probably way out of balance at that juncture. And yet, I could play and read and do my job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;What got me into Bruford and what got me into these bands was, at that particular time, I had played with a whole lot of the musicians that were famous in the 70s. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbie_Mann&quot;&gt;Herbie Mann &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Martino&quot;&gt;Pat Martino &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I recorded with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Moraz&quot;&gt;Patrick Moraz &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when he was the keyboard player in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_(band)&quot;&gt;Yes &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when Yes was at its absolute height. I recorded and played, oh goodness, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Benson&quot;&gt;George Benson &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Liebman&quot;&gt;Dave Liebman &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we had a band with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_%22Pee_Wee%22_Ellis&quot;&gt;Pee Wee Ellis &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I was in Europe as the house bass player for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Records&quot;&gt;Atlantic Records &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; hired by Herbie Mann to record and play a great deal of the artists that were featured at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreux_Jazz_Festival&quot;&gt;Montreaux Jazz Festival &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bruford-and-van-halen&quot;&gt;Bruford and Van Halen&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, my pedigree was good, my thing was growing, and then &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.raygomez.com&quot;&gt;Ray Gomez &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who was a guitar player and a friend of Patrick Moraz, who got me on the Patrick record, recommended–or, Patrick recommended me to Bill Bruford. Wait, I gotta get this straight. Patrick mentioned to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Bruford&quot;&gt;Bill Bruford &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about this great guitarist, which he is, named Ray Gomez and I was playing with Ray Gomez in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmine_Appice&quot;&gt;Carmine Appice &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;’s band. So, Bill came to America to check out Ray. I was the bass player and Bill ended up hiring me for his band. I played with his band, did several very-well-received records, toured quite a lot with that group, and am as grateful as can be to have had the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Bill opened &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; up for me.&lt;/span&gt; He is, or was because he’s retired now–I would call him a guy that had the intelligence and the spiritual wherewithall to utilize every element of his playing in an original manner. He was arguably one of the more average technical drummers around, kinda quirky and [scat drumming], you know–that thing. And yet, there was an infectiousness in it &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; he was utterly original in that. So, a lot of guys who, let’s say had more physical technique, weren’t as identifiable in their style approach as Bill Bruford was. And &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; was a very big lesson for me. That proceeded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/uim0FMZvADk&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Holdsworth&quot;&gt;Allan Holdsworth &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was in the group. Later I played with Allan, went to Los Angeles, and, you know, things ensued. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Halen&quot;&gt;Van Halen &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Van_Halen&quot;&gt;Eddie Van Halen &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and I became friends at that time. I was invited to play in the band, an invitation which I turned down, but I think they wouldn’t have had me anyway. I don’t think &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lee_Roth&quot;&gt;David Lee Roth &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; felt I was of an attitude to have in that band, but nonetheless, Eddie did make me that offer and I did consider it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;For reasons I &lt;em&gt;won’t&lt;/em&gt; go into, I didn’t accept it, except to say I would love to play with him today. We’re older gentlemen. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;He’s, to me, as great a musician as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Coltrane&quot;&gt;John Coltrane &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in that Coltrane changed &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; in the way that the saxophone was viewed and the manner of playing&lt;/span&gt;, he originated everything. So did Eddie Van Halen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;He is one of the great and unique talents that I’ve ever heard on guitar. And &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; felt that somebody like myself, a Billy Sheehan, someone of a more adventuresome nature, might make even Van Halen sound greater, although I do admire what his son has done and I am quite a fan of Michael Anthony having felt that he was, even still, the perfect bass player for Van Halen. No doubt about it. So, there you go, and now I’m 63.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/2mnipvcmVdE&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;teaching-methods&quot;&gt;Teaching Methods&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Somewhere along the way, you got quite interested in teaching methodologies. You were a student, obviously, and along the way you evolved, learned technique, mastered the instrument–or, have been trying to and continuing to over the decades…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: “Trying to” is more correctly put.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: The better the musician, it seems, the more they “try” is what I hear about. Can you talk about what got you into teaching and what informed your teaching methodologies over the years?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: In a nutshell, my teaching methodologies that I formed came out of my years on violin and my tenure at Berklee School of Music. At the time it was called “School of Music.” Both areas were entirely focused on musical content. Very little that I ever recall was ever referred to in terms of the word “groove,” “feel,” “heart,” “art,” “artistry,” or anything… Rather that &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;people that learned their instrument and practiced their instrument already had enough of an inspiration and a feeling for it that the art part was sort of already taken care of.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;The part that might not have been taken care of is where to put the fingers on the neck or where to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_rudiment#Diddle_rudiments&quot;&gt;paradiddle &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyrhythm&quot;&gt;polyrhythm &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a snare drum or play the vibes or play the guitar or the horn. This became noticeable to me when in the 80s, I noticed, at least on bass, a detour from musical content and a new paradigm began to show up, which included non-musical methodologies. “Non-musical” meaning “learning for its own sake.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Learning music, like anything well-done, takes time and isn’t easy.&lt;/span&gt; Where a story began to evolve that “study with us” or “study with me” or “there’s a million ways to learn” (which there are, by the way), but ironically, there’s a million things to eat, I’m just not sure I want to eat them all. Do you follow the logic? I agree there’s a million ways to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, I began to sort of, at that time in the sort of imbalanced area that I was–I’ll get to that later. I’ve been psychologically imbalanced for many years. I grew up hard, very dysfunctional family and paid the price for it up until rather recently where there was a rather combative and not very pleasant aspect to me that I know existed, but didn’t give a hoot that it did. “You don’t like it? To hell with you.” So, I was almost deliberately supporting and constructing a rather evil personality, but not aware of what the results would be. Not outwardly, but inwardly. That I’ll discuss in a minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;The educational thing came about where a lot of people who are popular in music started to teach and in my opinion, in my &lt;em&gt;opinion&lt;/em&gt;, taught incorrectly in that people say they were getting better from the methods I would do a lot of clinics in those days and I’d developed a way where “Come on up! We’ll play what you wanna play and I’ll do a little critiquing” because if I tell you personally, “Anthony, you’re holding the neck too hard or you’re not representing the notes in a G major &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triad_(music)&quot;&gt;triad &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” probably quite a few guys in the audience also grip the neck too hard and don’t represent notes correctly. So, what I offer to you as a demonstration usually applied to most people that were there anyway. We all share a common beginning in pretty much everything, so music seemed to be the same thing. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Art is universal. To me, learning it is not.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Anyway, I got into saying that these methods “aint g’wine t’work.” They’re not gonna do you what you think that they’re gonna do you. And I took notice that &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;a lot of people were content to follow advice and never question the advice being given&lt;/span&gt; because they’re admirers of bass players or guitar players or drummers who offered this advice, but who were either self-taught or not fully supportive of music itself. Having partially come from a training background, but usually abandoning it or not relying on it, philosophically going in other ways. Often what was being shared was emotionally satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;If I tell you, personally, that whatever you play is great, has meaning, and you’re expressing your heart, and what you do is fine, it exists, this is how you feel… That’ll be $100. In the essence of the sharing of this philosophy, I took note that it became so popular in so many other areas of teaching, generally again from self-taught people that might not have understood the meaning of music. I can’t understand the grammatic meaning of French having never really studied it. I can Spanish because I have studied it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, I began to object and in a rather mean-spirited way, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I began to attack and covertly and overtly slander people and it was all based on a psychological instability.&lt;/span&gt; I wasn’t wrong, and to this day I don’t feel that I was wrong or I am wrong about anything that I ever felt about education and about learning. I feel a generation… I feel two generations have been let down by the well-intended and kind advice from people that meant no harm and meant no collusion that “we’re gonna fake these guys out and get their money.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/rzpfeIDxBs4&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;self-taught&quot;&gt;“Self-taught”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;People believe the things they say. What I’ve come to believe is that it’s their right and I’ve no right to criticize anymore.&lt;/span&gt; That’s my alert/awakening and I’m living this. But, in the terms of advice to people in the educational thing, there’s only two ways to learn that I’ve ever thought about, which is being self-taught and by learning musical content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Self-taught includes you taking that guitar off the wall behind you and putting on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_Ray_Vaughan&quot;&gt;Stevie Ray Vaughan &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; record, listening, imitating, going out, jamming with your friends, trying a Fender amp, then going to a Marshall cabinet, now trying to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.markbass.it&quot;&gt;Markbass &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; amps, now trying &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallien-Krueger&quot;&gt;Gallien Kruger &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, testing this, trying that, putting on these strings, pedals, playing with this drummer, that drummer… Anything that you’ve done under your own auspices, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;anything you’ve done under your own control is a self-taught endeavor because you’re not paying me or anybody else to teach you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;The second way I felt–and this produced, by the way, everybody. I’m a trained musician, but I’m self-taught. You’re a guitar player, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: And I know you’re self-taught. I know you’ve picked the guitar up. No matter what you’ve learned, I know you’ve listened and done stuff on your own. Am I right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: And the reason I say it with such confidence is because everybody is! &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Everybody, the most trained musicians are self-taught.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaco_Pastorius&quot;&gt;Jaco Pastorius &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Jack Bruce, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Wakeman&quot;&gt;Rick Wakeman &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;–I showed him a piece of music recently… Not recently. It was actually about 21 years ago! “The other day! No, that was 21 years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;academic-learning&quot;&gt;Academic learning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, the second way is academically, which is the elements related to music that you can’t or have trouble getting or one can’t find on their own because there’s a million books, many of which I personally feel will not get you to play better. There is a manner to learn academically and I notice that in music history since the time of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bach&quot;&gt;Bach &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or before, up until the time of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gershwin&quot;&gt;George Gershwin &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, up until &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_Goodman&quot;&gt;Benny Goodman &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Miller&quot;&gt;Glenn Miller &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and up into the 50s and 60s that they’re training musicians, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Burton&quot;&gt;Gary Burton &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;s, the schooled guys, the great arrangers, the people that are–&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Williams&quot;&gt;John Williams &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a trained guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I’m wandering here because &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;everybody since the early 17th century and earlier have all been trained the same way. The only thing that really has changed is the music itself.&lt;/span&gt; They sat students down at 3 or 4 or 5 years old and a teacher or a parent said, “This is a G, this is an A, and I want you to write it like this.” And subsequently, a tenure, an apprenticeship began. Now recognize this, everybody with a little deviation–I know they’ve got the Suzuki method and they’ve got this approach and that approach–it all was based in the center of you and I sitting down with a guitar, bass, or piano and a teacher saying, “Play A B C D E.” All of it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Gershwin learned how to write and compose in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartment&quot;&gt;tenement apartment &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Do you follow? &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven&quot;&gt;Beethoven &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was taught, obviously, by many, many people. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Armstrong&quot;&gt;Louis Armstrong &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; had private lessons. Exhibited a thing that a teacher taught him to play, more or less, and you see the indentation on his lip. What had changed was musical content, not the manner in which to teach (for the most part).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Jaco Pastorius is a self-taught bass player. I mention him because everybody knows Jaco. Jaco learned how to arrange and compose physically and academically in a bus and in hotel rooms. A guy sat him down and said, “This is how we do it.” What was his name? Bret? Brent? Charles Brent, who passed away, I understand. So, when I got the idea that everybody learned music this way, and again there are no exceptions that I can think of–maybe one guy in Istanbul and another guy in Rotterdam–do you follow? The trained guys, they all learned the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/nRFbfBGgpbw&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Suddenly I noticed that bass players aren’t being trained that way at all. In fact, a new paradigm was being invented and new approaches that I can now tell you my story and say things like, “Here’s an idea that worked for me. It may not work for you, but it worked for me.” And I thought about that principle and thought to myself, “That’s interesting,” because in my case, I guarantee you Anthony or anyone that’s listening, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;whatever worked for me, I’m &lt;em&gt;guaranteeing&lt;/em&gt; you, is going to work for you.&lt;/span&gt; And that, to me–and I’m &lt;em&gt;guaranteeing&lt;/em&gt; this. It’s not just a statement. Because I made that statement publicly and could fulfill that declaration, it occurred to me that music and education was compromised, that a feel-good endeavor–am I talking too long by the way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: No, the whole purpose of this website is to allow the artist to speak at length. I’d rather hear as much as you have to say and as little as I have to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: I just want to make sure I’m not wandering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: No, please go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: It was just that when this became–this replaced music because when I fought so hard to emphasize music in music education, I took note that some people that weren’t into it sort of went, “Well, yeah, music is good too.” This was a contribution, I suppose, because of the pressure that I’d put on that–I lament the pressure part of it. That’s the thing about this whole thing. I do feel that bass education and, again, done by well-meaning people–nobody’s evil here. Nobody. I just feel the whole system’s been compromised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I recently heard about a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratching&quot;&gt;record-scratching &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; class at Berklee and I heard about a heavy metal class in a school in Nottingham, England, that you can get a degree in. “This is heavy metal. You’ll study and play &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallica&quot;&gt;Metallica &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sabbath&quot;&gt;Black Sabbath &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll go on tour and you’ll get a degree.” I simplify the thing. And now record scratching and other elements of education–there’s things in bass that I think are shocking, but, to make clear: &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;this is &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; feeling, people don’t have to agree with it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I’ll share what I think and hopefully, without wishing to cause harm–I don’t want to cause harm to anybody. That’s where my whole thing is utterly changed. What I do want to do is change focus back to where I feel it has deviated from, which is deviated from the fact that musicians only get better if they learn correctly, practice correctly, and play correctly or incorrectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;You play, you grow in that, you listen to early Clapton, which I have, and he wasn’t the guitar player that he subsequently became. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimi_Hendrix&quot;&gt;Jimi Hendrix &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; apprenticed with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Richard&quot;&gt;Little Richard &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Isley_Brothers&quot;&gt;Isley Brothers &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; playing [50s rock and roll scat]. He had his thing, it was still coming out, but since music is deviated from what I consider the true message, which is: musicians, if you want to get better, it’s not entirely easy, but &lt;em&gt;so what?&lt;/em&gt; It’s fun! My bass is never far from me. I pick it up and I practice and I play and the endeavor to do something that I don’t know so that I can eventually become better seems a positive thing to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Jw6oOXuq10&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;music-is-hard-work&quot;&gt;Music is hard work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;There is a statement made that music, I think &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Wooten&quot;&gt;Victor Wooten &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said this, that “academic music is proven to work, it just takes too long.” And I heard that and I thought and I remembered something that Obama once said, “Anything worth having isn’t easy.” There’s a million philosophical messages that we work for the things we love. They don’t always come easy. In my mind, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;“So what if music, learning it properly, takes a long time. So what?”&lt;/span&gt; What artist–look at the history of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Gogh&quot;&gt;Van Gogh &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who studied and suffered his whole life through mental illness, but eventually evolved to the master that we know today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;All musicians–I saw early &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciano_Pavarotti&quot;&gt;Pavarotti &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; singing locally and developing his career and he took vocal lessons for many, many years. So what if it takes “too long?” I’m against the idea that musicians will embrace an easy way out when it’s intended that the work is not supposed to be a detriment, it’s supposed to be an enhancing thing. It builds our character. We’re working for our music, for our artform. Holy mackerel! Is that not too great or what? “I did an exercise today and I couldn’t play it. I really was terrible at it.” You know? Not literally, it’s just an example. And the answer is, “Sure! Because tomorrow it might be better.” That’s progress. That’s improvement. So what if it’s bad today? You know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, I’m not happy with the general all-round vision that working for our artform is an awful thing because everybody I know who is either self-taught or trained in music–and as far as I’m thinking, I’m curious–and, by the way, “self-taught” means playing, jamming, hanging… Anything that’s free. Free! You know, except buying the guitar and toys. It’s the human development of your instrument. I can’t think of a third option other than learning music or being self-taught. I don’t know if there’s a third option and yet, I’ve seen that an industry has presented a third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth options. My message is: my vision is different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Have you talked to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Fripp&quot;&gt;Robert Fripp &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by any chance about this stuff?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: I know Robert, but I haven’t talked to him about this. Why? Is Robert in the same mindset?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I went to a week long guitar camp thing that he leads called the Guitar Circle and he said, “Everyone who is self-taught, raise your hand.” So, of course, I raise my hand, so do nearly everybody else in the class and he says, “What you’re effectively telling me is somebody who knew nothing about the instrument, who knew nothing about music as a craft, who knew nothing about the technicalities of playing taught you everything that you know about what you’re doing. Tell me how that’s effective.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: It’s exactly and precisely my same philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I think you two would have an interesting conversation around some of this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: Well, it’s important to point out that &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;my only comment here is about education. It’s not about art and the way one plays and the way one chooses to play.&lt;/span&gt; I was told that I am not welcome at many music schools because of the fact that I’ve lambasted more mean-spiritedly music education schools, teachers, magazines, web–I mean, I put ‘em all in and cocked my rifle. In that manner, I lament it and I’d like to talk about that in a second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;What hasn’t changed is perhaps I’m finding another way to relate a thought to people and if they don’t believe in it, of course they must go through their own way. I don’t want to cast aspersions against someone different than me–anymore! I don’t want to be to be rude to anybody. I quoted Victor, but Victor changed things for the better by opening up music to 10,000 kids. You know what I mean? Our philosophies diverge, mine with other guys diverge, but if the intrinsic need is to educate, then I imagine they’re doing a good thing, a kind thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I just think that in the specific end of things, I could quote several guys and offer thoughts where I feel that the message is misleading people. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;The problem with me is political.&lt;/span&gt; If I do this, I’m not so sure, especially with the harm that I’ve caused before, that it would be taken that way. So as a part of my penance, for the most part, I can only offer my thoughts and keep it as neutral and show love and respect for different people who teach differently than I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/wQON9fHPJsk&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;love-what-you-learn&quot;&gt;Love what you learn&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Do you believe that if people were taught as historically people have been taught music, the music scene, the music industry would be wildly different? Do you think that pop music of today would be produced if a requirement was that formal training be introduced to all musicians, like there’s some sort of threshold in order to be able to release music or something?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: Well, I imagine that the level of awareness of music would be higher, so perhaps some of the music that is going on today that, to my ear, is rather [long pause] different, that perhaps a higher awareness from people might not tolerate that kind of music and demand from artists and themselves something that isn’t supposed to be virtuosic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;People often try to find holes–I notice people will work harder to find loopholes in what I say than to try to get the general message and often they’ll say, “Well, I don’t want to be a virtuoso.” And my thing is I say, “Well, I never mentioned the word!” I simply say that the level of music–I’m a fairly good Beatle bass player just because I happen to know so much about the bass that I don’t even have to think twice about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I can play Beatles songs with real feeling. Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Lee_(bassist)&quot;&gt;Will Lee &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fab_Faux&quot;&gt;The Fab Faux &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Will is a studied guy and can do this. But to answer your question, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I don’t look at music education as a part of an artistic success story.&lt;/span&gt; I don’t look at music ed as being done in order to have a career. I look at music ed as done so that one could be a better player and therefore qualify to have a music career. Now I know it’s a subtle point of thinking, but often people will practice thinking, “Well, I’m ready for the gig,” or practice and “Maybe now I can audition for a famous band,” or whatever. My thinking is, “I wouldn’t go that way.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I would say to everybody, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;“Practice &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; you love &lt;em&gt;music&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/span&gt; and that this instrument, in my case, deserves to be learned better for its own sake! I have my bass nearby and I’m always practicing ideas and the thing is that I’ve developed a career that coincidentally occurred because I was qualified, it seems, to have one, rather than, “I’ll practice this scale and then I’ll use it tonight on a gig.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;You might be surprised to find out that &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;scales were never meant to be used in professional music&lt;/span&gt; because professional music and all its artistic different parts isn’t based on scales. It’s based on the artful use of melody and rhythm and harmony that coincidentally sometimes might include a scale, but what you practice is not usable on a gig.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;People erroneously have been saying, or asking, “How do I use this?” And I say, “You don’t! You don’t use this on a gig.” I’m a Spanish student and they say in Spanish, “Yo voy a la playa. (I go to the beach.) Tu vas a la playa. (You go to the beach.) Nosotros vamos a la playa. (We go to the beach.) Ellos vama los playa. (They go to the beach.)” &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;There isn’t a Spanish-speaking person on earth that talks like that&lt;/span&gt; and yet I conjugated these verbs in class to learn the conjugations and eventually, the artistic element began to take place. Can I give you another example?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Of course!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;music-as-a-language&quot;&gt;Music as a language&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: People refer to music as a language. It’s a very popular tenet of function, belief, that music is a language because it communicates things. Okay. I took note that when we learn English, in our case–obviously other countries and other societies learn their languages &lt;em&gt;by ear&lt;/em&gt;–it’s interesting to note that probably close to 100% of us went to school to academically develop our skill in our language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;We learn reading and writing and giving book reports, which is us standing up in front and, “I read the book &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Tale_of_Two_Cities&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Tale of Two Cities&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” and we’re working on our speech and enunciation and use of words and it’s all an academic endeavor and we all went into academic use and learning and practice of language since we’re 1st grade or kindergarten up until 12th grade and then there’s English literature and higher forms of it in college and universities. What musicians have not done that I can see is recognize that &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;if music is a language, why aren’t they &lt;em&gt;learning&lt;/em&gt; it as one?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/OZgpiMrsC5U&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;clichs-of-belief&quot;&gt;Clichés of belief&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Musicians sometimes have built in to their belief systems clichés. The clichés are the things that bass players feel, “Keep the bottom,” “Gotta play a groove,” “The groove is the most important thing, more than notes,” or something of this nature, when ironically, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;if you don’t play the right notes, there’s nothing to groove on.&lt;/span&gt; So, the concept is a backward concept. A groove is a &lt;em&gt;result&lt;/em&gt; of first using the right notes the right ways–according to the feel of the song–and hence, in the comfort of doing that, a groove ensues. A groove is a result, it’s not the principal thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I don’t sacrifice words to communicate with you so that I have a groove in the manner of communication. I will say to you, “I feel like eating, um… what is that word? Spaghetti! At the end of our interview, I’m going to go in and cook it.” So, what comes first is the word, so next time, I can say, “Ya know man, I gotta have me some spaghetti because I’m an Italian food freak and I ain’t kiddin’ and I’m gonna get down in the kitchen and I’m gonna be pitchin’ a nice bowl o’ s’ghetti in my face.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Now, I’m being ridiculous, but there is a jazz development to that that the creative development is that I use words and then invent words. First comes the words. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;How do we speak if we don’t know the words? How does anybody communicate in time?&lt;/span&gt; And in time is the time of communication, the ebb and flow of it. If you want to see how hesitant you will be in the communication area of language, I would ask you to say something to me in German or Dutch where I also could not do it. Or Italian. Spanish is my language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;If we can’t speak these languages, can’t “groove” in the language, it means because we don’t know the words. That’s my thing. That’s as far as my thinking goes. So when one says, “Groove is the best,” I say, “Eventually it is. But, if you don’t know the right notes and you don’t know how to play, why try to perform something that isn’t natural for you to play?” I’ve seen guys work on groove and playing and they’re all over the place! Their time is all over the place and their notes are all over the place because they teach a lot of guys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And I say, “Look at a tightrope walker.” You’ve got &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nik_Wallenda&quot;&gt;John… what’s his name &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;? The guy who crossed the two towers when they were up and crossed the Grand Canyon. You look at these guys. Do you ever notice that they take a couple steps backward sometimes in order to get their balance? They stop and they put a foot back and they wait and they wait and they balance and then they go forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Musicians are always going forward without stopping or going backwards one or two steps to see what they know to see what they don’t know.&lt;/span&gt; And if they did what I said, or people like me, they would change their entire sphere of playing. I could, me personally, if I were king of the music world, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I could change everybody’s playing in 3 to 6 months. Easily!&lt;/span&gt; If they did what I said. No democracy, you know what I mean? I’m good. I could hear you and say, “Okay, Anthony, here’s what you’re going to practice today and in that way I’ll make you better.” So, that’s sort of a benefit to me. I’m sharing these thoughts. I hope it doesn’t seem too hard or too mean-spirited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/uEk5rZkBxFo&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I’m curious. Personally, this resonates a lot with me and it’s part of the motivation behind the website itself. I see this every day in my work as a professional in the IT industry. The barrier to entry for software development is much lower than it ever has been and I know that I’m young, I’m 34, and I’m sure that there are people that have computer science degrees from 1980-some or 1990-some saying, “Oh, look at this whippersnapper. He thinks he can appreciate the barrier to entry,” but what I’m seeing as I manage software developers is completely improvised skills that were built alone with no formal instruction and I hire them and we have to train them in order to get them to do the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;It also reminds me of religious, spiritual contexts where Catholicism as one example, you go through years and years of schooling to become a priest, but in many Protestant non-denominational Christian churches, they’re started by people with no real formal background. They just have a spiritual zeal and they develop a following and sometimes they develop a church and that turns into an institution and you have to live with, if you’re Catholic, you have to live with the informal and say, “Well, anyone can start a church now,” whereas somebody who might attend that church might say, “Look at those guys and how formal they are. I can’t believe they think this is what it takes to believe in God.” So, those are two very personal examples that it reminds me of. Is there any relation there for you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: Sure! The relation would be the impact I got from what you’re saying is that, well it goes back to something that I’ve come to believe greatly now is that everybody has a choice and everybody has a right to choose and everybody wishes to improve can be a “Protestant” or a “Catholic.” I’m leaning more towards Buddhism these days than having the needs for it, but again that’s my choice and the variety of choices–there’s a little bit of a danger in choosing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Choice is often based on emotion and this is just a fact. We’ll choose a car not only on the gas mileage, but, “Man, check out how that looks!” Painting a home, the color that resonates with one. People will regard music in their manner of viewing it based on how they feel about things. “Feelings” are honest and I actually trust more my body than my mind in that my mind got me into trouble all the time. It would think that, “Well Anthony’s sitting there and asking me about this. He’s trying to trap me. And Anthony and Anthony and Anthony!” You know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: You sound like my wife!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: That’s what she does?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: No, I’m just kidding. She’s very kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: “My wife. You kiddin’ me? My wife.” I’m trying to think of “my wife” jokes. Oh yeah, “I take my wife everywhere, but she finds her way home.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henny_Youngman&quot;&gt;Henny Youngman &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; one-liners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZGtlxHgKUA0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;messages-and-cultish-behaviors&quot;&gt;Messages and cultish behaviors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: So, the thing is &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I just believe there is a lost society today in musicians in that they 1. are trusting the wrong messages, 2. I feel that often they have a cult attitude.&lt;/span&gt; The cult attitude is that if their hero or someone that they admire or location or center or being or something presents information, if they trust it, they never question it and woe to you if you criticize or question that person or institution. Woe to you because people will attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;This denotes to me a cult where the leader is infallible, never to be questioned. The institution, the philosophy, the book–I don’t know. Whatever it is. Don’t question it. Don’t even think that this source of information is wrong. And this is the downfall in part of music education because I have advised people in clinics, “Look, try anything because no harm will come from it, but don’t be so sure that even I, Jeff, be so sure that people are like, ‘Yeah, I like Jeff now…’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Don’t trust everything I say as if what I’m saying is gospel. Question it.&lt;/span&gt; Investigate my thoughts. Don’t fall into the trap that you substitute one perfect vision of guidance of music for another. If what I say makes sense, investigate it.” Example, rock education. Again, I’m not welcome in many schools, I’m not welcome and am not appreciated by people that teach rock because I’ve said that &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;rock education hasn’t produced the results that it’s promised&lt;/span&gt; or at least alluded to and the results would be learning the skill in rock to develop/have a career in rock, or even a good amateur chance at being a rather freed and expressive musician.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And I say this for the most part, not individually. I notice a lot of guys that may have been through rock education may have already been able to play, got to the schools, more or less may have done the same thing, got out, got a careeer, and feel that the school or the teacher or the book helped them. My thinking is that people–now I say this, which of course will not go down well, but it must be said–people need to check this out and find out if what I say is right or wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;If it’s wrong, ignore my words because I’m not saying it for evil intentions. I’m saying it to enlighten people that trust a system of learning that might not be producing what it says it should as a general system. If I’m wrong, well, I got this wisdom, 10,000 grads from this and 9,000 are in successful bands. “Berlin’s out of his mind!” I’ll accept that. “Thank you for checking out my statement and finding it wrong.” But I don’t think you will, and that’s my point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Xphugh8RHM&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rock-education&quot;&gt;Rock “Education”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;You can list a thousand guys. There’s 2, 3 million people that have passed through rock education. I’m grabbing a number out of the air, by the way, and a thousand names are used. Take 3 zeroes off one side and take 3 zeroes off the other and &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;you’ve got a 1 in 200,000 chance to possibly extract a career as a successful or even a decent rock musician.&lt;/span&gt; My question would be, “What if the statistics were the same if you studied the law? Would it be the same if you studied how to drive?” In all things vocational that I’ve noticed, there’s a real high success to the students for having invested money and time, because there’s a lot of time and a lot of money, and usually acquire careers through vocation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;In fact, in just about all areas of learning, what I’ve discovered is that rock music hasn’t fulfilled that promise and that people on the belief or again by the feeling, which I’m asking in them to question, that rock music is an entertainment (in &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; opinion! People don’t have to agree. It’s an entertainment. I’m very clear on this because I have a long history in which I was not so forthcoming and I want to make up for that, but it doesn’t mean I’m going to change my spot because I don’t see errors in my thinking so I’ll share it as benignly as possible. People check it out. If I’m wrong, follow your plans.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;From what I’ve seen, there’s a couple of websites, the top 100 rock bass players, top 100 jazz bass players, top 100 rock bands, top 100 you know. If you look at them, and I examined this and I barely could find anybody that claims from any of these sources that they went to a music school or went to a teacher–let’s say, maybe they did, because you know there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; exceptions, or went to some source or camp or tutorship and acquired a career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It would be an interesting thing for somebody with time on their hands to do this research and add up a thousand names and find out what area, and I’m very specific on “rock education,” “rock ensembles,” “rock lessons,” “rock music” in its varied forms. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/interview/steve-vai&quot;&gt;Steve Vai&lt;/a&gt; went to Berklee and studied &lt;em&gt;music&lt;/em&gt;. I don’t believe he studied rock. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Hamm&quot;&gt;Stu Hamm &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; went to Berklee and studied &lt;em&gt;music&lt;/em&gt;. I don’t believe he studied rock. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Gambale&quot;&gt;Frank Gambale &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Scott Henderson went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musicians_Institute&quot;&gt;MI &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to study with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Pass&quot;&gt;Joe Pass &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Diorio&quot;&gt;Joe Diorio &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Jazz guys. I don’t believe they studied rock.&lt;/span&gt; That’s just the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;If I try to support the principle for the good of our industry, for the good of the sake of musicians who really ought to be thinking more alertly and not be so quick to be sold, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;if rock education would change its name to rock entertainment, I wouldn’t say a word.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So, it’s kind of like when the Buddha says, “If you see the buddha walking to you, kill him.” You need to discover it for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: Well, I’ll change that. If the Buddha walks to me, I’ll ask and interview him to make sure he is Buddha. If he says, “I’m Buddha,” I won’t buy it right away, so I might spend a little time to find out for myself because if he is, I’m going to acknowledge it and say, “You know what? At the beginning, I thought you weren’t, but I’m wrong.” And this is the thing about all this that I’m talking about today, it is important to investigate for yourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It isn’t an 8-month tenureship at a library. You can do it in a week. Look at interviews. Look at what guys said. I just feel that rock has become &lt;em&gt;such&lt;/em&gt; a business and &lt;em&gt;such&lt;/em&gt; a money-maker and as long as people are willing to spend the money, why stop? I’m simply saying, “Go for the fun of it. Be a little on the alert if you feel this may help you to acquire a career because if it does, there has to be a precedent.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/9z6g7vBXboA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Rock has been around since the late 1970s when somebody decided to transcribe Eddie Van Halen and &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/frank-zappa&quot;&gt;Frank Zappa&lt;/a&gt; solos. I think Steve Vai did a whole book on that. Ironically, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;these transcriptions never &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; helped anybody to learn how to read nor play the guitar&lt;/span&gt;, in my opinion. One guy, two guys… It shows the genius of Steve Vai for having the ability to write it out. It doesn’t mean that a student or somebody buying it actually extracted any real benefit from it. What would have been the benefit was to put on the headphones and get into the grit and dirt and meat of listening and imitating to those Frank solos as all self-taught musicians do to improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;What has happened is rock education has sanitized the learning experience.&lt;/span&gt; Rock by its nature, and transcriptions and these things, is a filthy affair. It’s an affair based in grit, dirt, sweat, PHEW. “What the hell was he playing over there? Let me listen to that again. Damn, I still can’t get that.” And in the search, 2 things happen: 1. You develop your understanding of the artist and 2. “Well if he did this by hearing it so much, I got a couple of ideas where I might do it this way.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Hence the evolution from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Johnson&quot;&gt;Robert Johnson &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cray&quot;&gt;Robert Cray &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And the line of Cogbill and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Jemmott&quot;&gt;Jemmott &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and who preceded them, maybe the upright guys, to the Jacos and the great R ‘n B players, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocco_Prestia&quot;&gt;Rocco Prestia &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;s and the subsequent great funk players, the Victor Wootens in that unique funk and groove element of his bass playing–the lineage is a self-taught progression, but the sanitized element of “This is a G chord, now turn up your amp, now turn on your sound… There you go! Now check out that sound! Now play that chord!” True! But, a whole element–it’s like taking the trace vitamins out of spinach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;You’ve taken spinach and you’ve so concised it, so condensed it, so purified it that it has the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorophyll&quot;&gt;chlorophyll &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in it, but vitamin A, B, and trace elements, and biotene, and kerotene, and the nicotine, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_Weather_(album)&quot;&gt;Teen Town &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and all the teens is taken out of it so it’s become a sterile food item, which a lot of our foods are. Keep that in mind when you are willing to plop down a check and, for gosh sakes, if I had my way, I would like to change the whole system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;People in business aren’t happy with me, and I don’t blame them, but maybe we could replace it in two ways. 1. Maybe the people in business offer more content. Stop letting students run the show. What do they know about it? Teachers in schools and other places saying, “So what do you want to study?” I understand the philosophy in that, but students are picking their own classes and saying, “I don’t want to study this, I want to study that.” What?! They don’t do that in medical school or in the DeVry school of truck driving-lessons driving license. It’s like, “This is how it is DONE!” When people learn this way, they seem to get better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Xphugh8RHM&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Two questions come to mind. The first is: Do you believe musicians have a responsibility to their listeners or the audience? As they produce new musicians, somebody picks up–and I heard Steve Vai on the radio and said, “I want to play like that.” That happens all the time. You with the Beatles. And then secondly: Do you believe that had you not been educated the way you were, it would have even been possible for you to have the career that you have, to play the kinds of music that you’ve been on? I know that’s a really big hypothetical question, but there have to be some self-taught people without that education who are very great players, but what you are doing is so sophisticated, I’m wondering if you believe that level of sophistication could be achieved without the education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: The point here is this: If you choose to be self-taught, you’re within your right to do so. If you choose to study with somebody, and therefore write them a check, I suggest to &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;make sure that what you’re paying for is what you get. And that’s the whole difference. That’s the whole thing in a nutshell.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;The self-taught endeavor is fine. If anyone reviews back, I don’t criticize it. My whole thing is really, quite frankly, a financial thing. “Here’s money, fix my car. You’re going to fix it.” “Here’s money. Cook me a good meal or I won’t come back to your restaurant.” “Here’s money. I have a cold or a cut. Sew me up.” “Here’s money. I’m going to a therapist. Help me to learn about myself.” “Here’s money…” You follow what I’m saying. “I want to buy shoes that don’t fall apart.” “Here’s money. I want to learn how to navigate this instrument in musical ways that I don’t know.” And that’s all there is to it in my personal philosophy. So, your first question is what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I see. That makes more sense. The first question is whether you believe musicians have a responsibility to be educated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: No. They don’t have a responsibility because it’s an artform and an artform is open to interpretation and choice. What I do think is that students that bought a guitar are short-changing themselves by not taking the time to learn the guitar that even a weekend golfer is taking to learn how to hit a golf ball correctly. There’s more guys on the golf course that have taken from the golf pro at the club and learning how to hold the club and learning how to position because I used to think, “What fun is it to have golf clubs and constantly hit it into the trees?” Where’s the joy? “Oh boy! I love this game!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And the same thing occurred to me. People, who I feel are erroneously (some of them, not all of them) say, “Well, I have a guitar, but I’m not interested in really learning. I’ll do a couple of tunes and sit at home and just strum away.” And that’s fair! My suggestion is that if they just put in a few more months, they could get way beyond that and I’m curious if they went and bought a guitar or a bass or drums, wouldn’t they wish to put in the time, which is not 6 hours a day–I’ll put in 6 hours a day because it’s my career, people are expecting something from me or people like me, so &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; have a responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/mIdPO3PXX0s&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;communication-and-entertainment&quot;&gt;Communication and entertainment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But, if a guy’s just playing and wants to do his thing, his responsibility might be more to his own investigation. And when he starts to play, I guess the responsibility is not to play in a poor manner so that people sitting in a bar might have a modicum of entertainment because &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I do believe in the entertainment element. We need to be entertained. I watch television, I go to the movies, I go to music shows. Music is an entertainment.&lt;/span&gt; Communication and music–you know everybody communicates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;There’s a funny thing about, “You gotta communicate with people.” And I thought, “But anybody does! Anybody on the stage plays with authenticity at their level.” They’re playing and they know people are out there watching and digging it. I don’t know anybody who plays that doesn’t want to communicate. “I’m gonna play, but I don’t give a hell about you, Anthony.” What?! That doesn’t happen on a gig. We’re playing. Everybody’s a little excited or nervous or scared or jittery or “ooh, there’s a hot girl there and man, my friends are listening and, oh I hope I don’t forget that song, man.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;We are not separate from the emotion and the communicative element of music.&lt;/span&gt; That’s another little false cliché: people play without feeling. I have a feeling that &lt;em&gt;everybody&lt;/em&gt; plays with feeling. Nobody plays like, “I. Have. No. Feeling. Whatsoever.” People that do this are trying to extract the notes and play with feeling. Everybody has feeling. Everybody, but the top players have less mystery of where to put their fingers. You look at a top player and they’re playing the same lines and the same music they played a long time, so it isn’t a mystery anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; they have left is emotion. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;It’s the only element left in the thing because they know what to play.&lt;/span&gt; Look at a Stevie Ray Vaughan video and watch him play and his thing is this [bobbing his head left and right] because that’s the essence of what I wish everybody would get to in some manner. To dismiss the mystery of where to put the fingers, which is what academic music does, and get into the feeling of it because that’s the goal!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;If there was a law that said, “Jeff, what would you do: play only or study only?” I’d play only and I’d tell everybody to do the same. Don’t study a lick, don’t play a note, just pick up your guitar an play. If there was a law! But since there isn’t such a law, I’ll give advice on how to get better. Hopefully it’s acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/vSKDK9eNxQU&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;making-weird-music&quot;&gt;Making weird music&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: This brings me to making weird music. “Weird” is a marketing term. It’s a very vague term intentionally. What I’m going for is to encourage people to discover what is unique about them and to put that into their music instead of making something that’s already been made a hundred thousand times, do something that’s unique and interesting to you by you for yourself so that others can enjoy it. How do you believe that what you’ve been talking about here can lead to, and you’ve touched on this a little bit but I’d like to hear a little more in-depth, but how do you believe that these methods can lead to finding your own true self in the artform?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: I think the same way that learning English in elementary school, junior high school, and high school has led us to express our feelings and thoughts with great emotion about the presidential candidates, about the state of the country, about the latest news coming out of Europe, about our feelings about our loud neighbor or whatever, our feelings about anything that we feel–and if you go on the internet, you’ll notice everybody emoting with great freedom and liberty, their feelings and &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;the reason they do is they don’t worry about the words and they don’t worry about the grammar.&lt;/span&gt; That’s the way I feel can answer this whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Now, another thing, it is, to me, an incorrect order of things to suggest to people to find their own thing on their guitar right now. I’ll explain. People that find their own thing, the “weird music” that they have, the “weird” thing, generally comes from the genius or motivated guy/woman/person who hears it to do it. Most people are not so gifted and most people are not so inclined. Most people can’t tune a guitar without a tuner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;In the limitation of playing and in the limitation of understanding how a guitar works the nature of &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;suggesting to add and function in the “weird” element, to me, seems inappropriate at this time.&lt;/span&gt; That the “weird” element of music, Jaco’s harmonics was &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt;, but it came later and it evolved after he first learned the notes because if you listen to early Jaco he was not doing those things. The “weird” playing of Hendrix, he always did that sort of thing and he was fired from bands or criticized by the groups he played with, but the real distinct Hendrix element came later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;The “weirdness”, the special thing. The special thing is the “weird” thing. The Ginger Baker drum tones, the way that he played. Jack Bruce’s bass tone, the “fart tone.” He relayed that to me one time. “Jeff, I’ve got a fart tone when playing my bass.” I said, “Yes lad, you sure have.” [said in the “worst Scottish ever.”] I would say to people, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;“Don’t be so desirous of being unique when people barely know what the note Ab is.”&lt;/span&gt; See, my statement doesn’t interrupt the artistic message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;learn-what-you-do&quot;&gt;Learn what you do&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;People have said something that is utterly wrong and I’ll quote it now: “I don’t learn reading and I don’t practice music because it can hurt my creativity.” Perhaps you’ve heard this statement. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;It is about as foolish a thing as one could say.&lt;/span&gt; “I don’t take cooking class because it’ll kill my creative cooking talent.” “I don’t take English lessons because it’ll interrupt how I wish to communicate my thoughts.” Do you follow? “I’m not gonna take driving classes. I see how they drive. I know how I want to navigate the streets.” “I’m a doctor. I don’t take medical classes. You’re coughing? I know how I want to treat you.” I’m being a little silly here, but you get the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;The message is not only false, it’s destructive.&lt;/span&gt; It’s been destructive to young people who have believed this, that as if learning the craft of your instrument and learning the language of it in an academic way, as we’ve all learned, is a detriment to your art. The self-taught people are &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; the only ones who can state that their thing is entirely based on their own merits because they have no infusion of factual and, frankly, unemotional musical information. So, those people have both represented very well the self-taught ethic and how beautiful and perfect it is, and these people have also screwed things up for everybody else!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;These guys &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; point to these guys and say, “Well, &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; didn’t go to school.” And in that sort of effort, like I say, I think people were sometimes (not all) seeming to work hard to find a loophole when I used to have these debates, which I’ll never have again. I would make points on Facebook and make a statement about music education and they would come back with every loophole you could imagine. It was amazing to me that I felt &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;people were working harder to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; see the logic of learning well rather than putting in the time to learn music.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4MOVvDJxBSU&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;This gave me an inkling as to this corner of our community of players: people that are within their right to distance themselves for their own reasons from learning. Okay, so be it. The message, I guess, in this–the final element of this–is that &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I wouldn’t seek the “weird” until I sought the obvious.&lt;/span&gt; If by having the obvious, it’s almost like before I start to build up a really strange construction of a home with weird slats and lats and roof, I’m gonna lay a real firm slab of cement first so everything doesn’t come crumbling down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Musicians are constantly crumbling down and the way you can see it is go to Craigslist or go anywhere they’re selling secondhand guitars. There are people buying and selling guitars every single day and they’re not replacing them with new ones. Some do. You know what I mean? I’m a voice and I’m alone and I don’t mind it, I just am a guy that came out of music education as formally trained as one could possibly get since I’m 5 years old. I’m 63, so that’s 58 years in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I just wrote David Liebman yesterday and asked him for lessons so I could learn some new ideas. I studied with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Banacos&quot;&gt;Charlie Benacos &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the greatest jazz instructor maybe of the 20th century. I have here my book of transcriptions of jazz piano and guitar that I review so I can learn to play better. And then I’m not out to just play virtuoso music. I want to play the blues. I want to play funk. I got a call from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Power&quot;&gt;Tower of Power &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when Rocco was ailing so that I could fill in for them, but I was on the road so I couldn’t do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;People are contacting me not so I can play solos. I don’t want to play solos except on my records. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I want to play bass and I can. And there’s nothing that I can’t do and I don’t say it from ego. There’s nothing I feel I can’t express in my English, but there’s a lot I can’t express in my Spanish.&lt;/span&gt; So, I’ve come to a level. Is there anything you can’t really express in English if you know your subject?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;You’re not egotistical to say, “Well, no, I can tell you how I feel in my thoughts.” People can be happy if they’re conducting themselves well and learn well. So, we’re all in the same boat. There’s no difference between me, you, or anybody else, except that I learned better than most and because I did I have some thoughts that are kind of rare in this day and age. Hopefully I can share them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;end-of-part-1&quot;&gt;End of Part 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for part 2!!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Soundslice</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;soundslice&quot;&gt;Soundslice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soundslice is an incredible tool for musicians that brings sheet music to life on the web. It lets you put your sheet music into a web page without any PDFs, Flash players, browser plugins, special MIDI stuff, etc. Here’s an example of Soundslice in action:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.soundslice.com/scores/39032/embed/&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see (and hear!), it plays anything you throw at it giving you plenty of options, like a piano viewer, live guitar fretboard, notation synchronized with tablature synchronized with audio, and it lets you upload multiple audio and video tracks to accompany the sheet music. Within the site is the capability to create and sell collections of music lessons where you keep 70% of the revenue from each sale. It’s frikkin’ awesome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://soundslice.com&quot;&gt;Still don’t get what Soundslice does? Check out their site! &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-context&quot;&gt;Some Context&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is my interview with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.holovaty.com&quot;&gt;Adrian Holovaty &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, co-creator of Soundslice, gypsy jazz guitarist, educator, and one of the world’s leading web software developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2013, a friend told me about &lt;a href=&quot;http://soundslice.com&quot;&gt;Soundslice &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I checked it out and was blown away. My first thought was: “Finally, someone has built something I’ve been too lazy to do myself!!” I was stunned to see that it was built by the guy who’d started the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)&quot;&gt;Python &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_(web_framework)&quot;&gt;Django web framework &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. My full-time work is in web-based software development, so I already knew about Adrian peripherally. To find him behind Soundslice was exciting because it was nice to see another programmer/musician.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started exchanged lengthy emails about Soundslice (really, I mean &lt;em&gt;lengthy&lt;/em&gt;) regarding features, bugs, and ideas for the future of the product. We’ve been in touch since then (I can’t believe it’s over 2.5 years!) and finally met in person in Chicago in October 2015, just weeks before he moved to Amsterdam with his entire family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of 2015, I thought it would be cool to feature tools and gear to help people make weird music and Soundslice seemed like a great first choice. I absolutely love the product and want to get as many musicians using it as possible. I strongly believe it is the most important music product on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I reached out to Adrian and asked if he’d be interested in doing an interview. He kindly obliged and we made it work despite the significant difference in time zones between Phoenix and Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interview was conducted on Monday, January 18, 2016 at 5AM Arizona time via Google Hangouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interview-transcript&quot;&gt;Interview transcript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;Anthony: Hey, this is Anthony from MakeWeirdMusic.com. I’m here with Adrian Holovaty, who is broadcasting to us from Amsterdam. Hello Adrian!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Adrian: Hello!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Good afternoon! It’s 5AM here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AH: Yeah, 1PM for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: I was wondering if you could introduce yourself and talk about Soundslice, where the idea came from, and… Go ahead! You do the talking!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AH: Sure! So, I’m Adrian, I’m a musician and web developer from Chicago. I just moved to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam&quot;&gt;Amsterdam &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about two months ago and I run a website called Soundslice. The premise is it’s trying to &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;give you all the tools possible to learn a given piece of music all from your web browser&lt;/span&gt;. We do that by giving you slowed-down looping, listening to recordings, looking at sheet music, looking at videos, combining all this stuff into a single interface to make it easy to learn tunes. You sort have to see it to really understand it, but yeah, that’s my full-time thing. It’s a two-person company and it’s pretty awesome, if I may say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah, I absolutely love it. I think it’s such an incredible piece of technology. Can you tell me where the idea for Soundslice first came from? Why did you decide to take it upon yourself to start a company around online sheet music?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AH: Well, I do a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(music)&quot;&gt;transcribing&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve been doing this for probably more than 10 years and my process for all those 10 years has been: listen to a recording, write out either on paper or in a plain text file on my computer the tab of the guitar notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I can read music, but not very well, so I just use tab. For years I would painstakingly transcribe these old jazz recordings. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_Reinhardt&quot;&gt;Django Reinhardt &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; jazz guitar stuff. And I would come back to it a week later and I wouldn’t even understand my own transcription even though I did all the work of transcribing it. So, I would always have to go back to the original source recording and listen to it in tandem with the tab that I’d written out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;That got me really really craving a way of &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;seeing tab synced with a real recording&lt;/span&gt;. Of course, there have been for many years programs that show you tab and they play a synthetic MIDI kind of a sound, but I hate that. It’s horrible. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;It’s a horrible way to learn how to sound&lt;/span&gt;, how to make your guitar sound a certain way because it’s not a human playing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, I firmly believe the best way to learn (at least for my way of learning), &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;the best way for me to learn a tune is to listen to a real recording. I wanted to make something that let me marry the two: a real recording along with tab or sheet music&lt;/span&gt;. So, that was the original version of Soundslice. That launched in 2012 and it worked for YouTube videos where &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.soundslice.com/completed/&quot;&gt;you could find/search for any YouTube video on our site and transcribe it &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the transcription would be such that it would be linked with video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So you actually say, “From this moment in the video to this moment in the video, it’s playing this note on this string in this fret.” It’s very painstaking kind of a process. It got a following, but the number one bit of feedback that we had was, “Please add sheet music. Not just tab, because I’m a piano player or a horn player and I want to use it, but I can’t use it if it’s just tablature.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, we decided to just completely make a new product that was oriented around traditional sheet music instead of just tablature. Of course it still does tablature. That’s what we have now. So, the premise is you can create these interactive sheet music things, for a lack of a better term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Well, I think that’s a great high-level answer to that. I know that you’ve put a tremendous amount of effort into Soundslice and I consider it a pioneering piece of web technology because all the sheet music, the way you draw it out, the way it works in all web browsers, that makes it totally unique. Can you talk a little about that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AH: Well, all &lt;em&gt;newer&lt;/em&gt; web browsers. A lot of the stuff behind the scenes is pretty bleeding edge. In other words, it only works in modern web browsers. So, browsers that are younger than 3 or 4 years old. Basically, everyone is using a modern browser these days. If you’re stuck on an old Internet Explorer version at your office, it wouldn’t work for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But, just as an example of the bleeding edge… I’ll give you two examples of living on the bleeding edge. One is audio on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Audio in web pages has always been a fiasco&lt;/span&gt;. For many years, Flash was the only game in town. You had to use Flash in order to play audio on a webpage. And, fortunately there’s a new thing called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5_Audio&quot;&gt;Web Audio API &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I won’t get into all the geeky details, but there’s a new thing that lets you play audio in web pages and that’s what we use. However, when we first added that to Soundslice, it was so new that an auto-update of the Google Chrome browser actually broke Soundslice because they changed the way that they wanted the thing to work. So, I had to fix Soundslice to deal with new &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; stuff instead of the old stuff. It was kind of weird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, the second thing is we’re about to launch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.soundslice.com/blog/29/introducing-soundslice-offline-mode/&quot;&gt;offline mode &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Later today, in fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/FtoGbbH3DYA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Oh, congratulations!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AH: Actually, by the time this is published, it’ll exist. Hopefully… Unless it turns out to be horrible. In my blog announcement, which I’ve just drafted, I point out that it only works in Google Chrome at the moment, but it will work with Firefox in &lt;em&gt;one week&lt;/em&gt; because the upcoming version of Firefox will support this technology. So, it’s super-new stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: That’s awesome. Can you tell us about how you ended up building the sheet music component and where that has led… Actually, you should probably talk about what the product offerings are. What do you sell through Soundslice and what are your different customers like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AH: There are three parts of the product/business. One is that you can buy–it’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.soundslice.com/learn/&quot;&gt;lesson marketplace &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;–you can buy music lessons through our site. It’s pre-recorded music lessons and we’ve got 10 courses at the moment and a couple dozen transcriptions of music &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;all done by indie artists and they get the majority of the revenue. 70%.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/oqyJ8n-LXeU&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;The premise there is: it’s like what I want when I learn a tune. I don’t want just the transcription, I want it synced up with the real recording so I can actually hear it. So, what you get when you buy these things is &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;lifetime access to transcriptions or music lessons that are all written out synced with audio&lt;/span&gt;, and in some cases video, of the teacher showing you stuff. So, that’s the first part of the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;The second part is we have a product for music teachers called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.soundslice.com/teachers/&quot;&gt;Soundslice for Teachers &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which lets them &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;create these interactive pieces of sheet music and then share them with students&lt;/span&gt;. That’s for a monthly fee, $20/month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And the third part is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.soundslice.com/licensing/&quot;&gt;licensing to other companies &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is actually the biggest part of the business, but it’s the part that our users don’t really know or care about because it doesn’t really affect them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;We work with almost 30 separate websites at this point who pay us a monthly fee to embed our player in their own site. So, there’s some big names there like &lt;a href=&quot;http://guitarworld.com&quot;&gt;Guitar World Magazine &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://truefire.com&quot;&gt;TrueFire &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which has awesome lessons, &lt;a href=&quot;http://premierguitar.com&quot;&gt;Premier Guitar Magazine &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://jamplay.com&quot;&gt;JamPlay &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;… But not just guitar, it supports other instruments as well. It’s just sheet music so it supports any kind of instrumentation that uses traditional standard notation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Have you found adoption of Soundslice for guitarists to be the greatest? Or do you find that it’s people all over the map?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AH: It’s definitely strongest in the guitar world just because that’s where we come from and that’s the people that I know that I was able to tell about it and it organically grows like that. With that said, since we launched the sheet music stuff, and specifically since we launched this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.soundslice.com/blog/18/new-features-and-free-exercises-for-pianists/&quot;&gt;interactive piano/keyboard view &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it’s been growing with other instruments too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/SCydRrbSby4&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, I’d say piano is our number 2 instrument. There’s a couple of piano instruction sites that license it. There’s a couple other instruments, too, in terms of the licensing. Of course people use it for all sorts of stuff, like people put orchestral scores in there with 20-some instruments, or a high school band director put band pieces in there, which have 20-some instruments, percussion because we added support a couple months ago. It’s all over the map. Most come as guitar, but yeah it supports everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: What are some of the major challenges you’ve had to overcome building Soundslice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AH: Making it fast enough to work in a web browser. It actually assembles the sheet music on the fly directly in the web page as you request it. So, the reason for that is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.soundslice.com/blog/28/new-smooth-scrolling-during-playback/&quot;&gt;it actually wraps to fit your device &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re on a super small screen, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;it’ll wrap the notation to fit the screen&lt;/span&gt; and only put one or two measures on every line as opposed to if you’re on a huge desktop screen, it’ll put 8-or-so measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Because that’s all happening directly in your web browser, it’s doing a ton of work and it continues to be an interesting technical challenge to make that fast enough so that it’s nice and responsive. You don’t actually know that it’s doing that stuff behind the scenes. There’s a lot of technical challenges like that. But then the non-technical challenges are just getting people to know about it and getting music teachers to use it and getting musicians to sell their lessons on our marketplace platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I’m a technologist first and foremost and I always seem to discount the non-technological stuff&lt;/span&gt;, but that’s really–that’s a challenge because I don’t know about it as much as I know about the tech stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: What about the drawing of sheet music? I would imagine if it was an easier thing to do, more people would do it, but you seem to be one of the only websites out there that allows for actual sheet music rendering in an HTML website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AH: Yeah, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;it’s a deceptively very, very hard task.&lt;/span&gt; Compared to drawing text–if you have an essay or a newspaper article, you have word wrap and, say you have justification where you have the words line up on both sides of both margins (left and right). Even someone who’s not a computer programmer can sort of figure out how that’s done. You just start at the left and keep putting words on the line until you run out of space and then, inevitably, there’s a tiny bit of space where the next word wouldn’t have fit, so you take that space and divide it among the other words and you’re done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;With sheet music, it’s that kind of thing, but it’s made probably a thousand times more difficult because you also have a lot of other constraints. If you have more than one part, more than one instrument, if they’re playing at the same time, the notes have to be perfectly vertically aligned. So you have to take that into account when you’re doing that justification. And then there’s the fact that the horizontal space after a note is proportional, but not &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; proportional, to other notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/8GGciFtk9ZU&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, the horizontal space after a whole note is &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; than the horizontal space after a half note or a quarter or an eighth note, but it’s not perfectly proportional. If it were perfectly proportional, it would be way too long. Although, as a side note, that type of layout is used for dyslexic musicians in that they really benefit from having a perfectly proporational note spacing. I’d like to implement that at some point because, actually, it would be easier than the real way of doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, you have to account for that horizontal space, you have to account for the vertical alignment, and you have to nicely proportion it so that it’s justified because that’s just the convention of sheet music throughout the centuries. It goes all the way across the page, there’s none of this ragged right like we have in text. So, just that in itself is a tricky programming problem. And then to make it fast is what really makes it challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I think that’s why we don’t see a lot of this kind of stuff being done. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;It’s just a lot of work and you have to juggle a lot of stuff.&lt;/span&gt; And at the same time, there’s an element of art to it where it has to look good and feel good. I’m still learning how to best make it look good and feel good. And that just comes, I think, with looking at a lot of old pieces of sheet music and talking to musicians and trying to read it yourself and figure out what feels and looks good to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: How much have you had to learn about sheet music layout and the traditional practices of how people used to it by hand and computer programs that do it now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AH: Well, I started from basically &lt;em&gt;zero&lt;/em&gt; and I have learned &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;, so the answer is “&lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;.” I’ve learned about the traditional practices. It’s called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_engraving&quot;&gt;music engraving &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” because in the old days it was actually engraving on the back side of a metal plate. You’d do everything in reverse with these little stencils and a hammer banging into this metal plate in reverse and then, when it’s reversed and it’s printed, the music prints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/345o3Wu95Qo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, a lot of those techniques are clearly outdated, but some of them still sort of make sense. Like, there’s a thing called “casting off,” where you consider the music that you need to print and then you consider the amount of space you have and you align it so it’s nice and even on the printed page. So, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;we do something like that, but digitally.&lt;/span&gt; There are other bits where the classic human, by-hand engraving is sort of replicated in software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: That sounds like a tremendous amount of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AH: This is way too geeky and dumb. If anyone’s still interested, I’m surprised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: I’m definitely interested. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;This site is all about details that most people wouldn’t be interested in&lt;/span&gt;. So, please go ahead and get as detailed as you like. Can you tell us how you use the website? I’m sure it’s solved some personal problems for you. Soundslice is filling several needs in your life. Where did it come into play?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AH: Totally! &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;When I want to learn a new piece of music, I stick it in Soundslice.&lt;/span&gt; It’s super effective. That’s my way of learning now. It’s also my library of stuff that I’m working on. Just last night, I was transcribing a YouTube video if this really nice chord melody thing and I pop it into Soundslice so that I can come back to it later and hear the original and see the YouTube video and see the notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, yeah, I love it just for learning stuff and also keeping track of all the stuff that I’ve learned and transcribed. And then, on the teaching side, before I just moved to Amsterdam, I taught a weekly gypsy jazz guitar class in Chicago for four, maybe five, years. I loved using it with my students. I’d show them something in class, maybe it’s like a lick or a chord progression or something, and then I would go home and record myself playing it and pop it into Soundslice and then send the students the Soundslice thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;To a person, they all say, “Wow! This is super useful.” Some of them were even joking, “Why do I even need to come to class? I just want to use this Soundslice thing.” &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Because you can just listen to it 20 times in a row, really get a sense of it, do it at your own pace, slow it down, you don’t have to worry about annoying the teacher or annoying your fellow students…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, I’ve really enjoyed using it with students, too. Then we have this new lesson marketplace. I’ve been learning some stuff from that as well. Some neo-soul guitar, which I know nothing about. I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; know nothing about, but now I know a little about because we have some courses. And it’s some cool stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: I’m sure having a product like this has introduced you to all sorts of new kinds of music and ways of using it that you hadn’t anticipated. Can you describe anything like that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AH: Yeah, one interesting one is with a high school band. They are using it in comparing their own band’s performance to a real performance. So, it’s like some big piece of music, maybe it’s like a 5-minute long band concert thing, and they record their own high school band playing it, they pop it into Soundslice, and then they get a source recording from some professionals who play the same exact piece, the same arrangement, and they also throw it in there and then, using the fact that we have multiple audio sources, they distribute it to their students (the Soundslice interface) so the students can actually see–they press play, it starts off with the professional recording.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ynK3rsdIubc&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;You see the playhead go by and any time they want, they can switch back to their high school performance and just get a sense as to how it differs, what parts are good, what parts are bad. I had another example of a teacher who was dealing with a student who did not–the teacher told the student, “Look, you’re not playing it right. You need to change your intonation.” Or whatever it was. The student was like, “No, I’m playing it right. It sounds good!” So, then the teacher recorded himself playing it, put it in Soundslice and put the student’s recording in Soundslice and the student was able to compare them and actually got to see, “Oh, yeah, now I see what’s up.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And of course, you could have done that just by sending mp3s, but the difference is when you see it synced with the sheet music and everything’s synced–as soon as you toggle the audio, it goes to the other performance and it picks up where the other left off, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;it just takes it to the next level.&lt;/span&gt; So, those are some use cases that I wouldn’t have thought of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: One thing I love about Soundslice is it is not in any way detrimental to the music industry. It’s not taking something away or giving something away for free. You actually are supporting musicians. Was that ever your intent? Do you have any sort of stance on Soundslice as a tool for musicians to support their art as craft?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AH: Definitely. That is fundamental to my beliefs–our beliefs as a company. Even though that sounds a little bigger than it should be because it’s only two people. “&lt;em&gt;Our company’s beliefs!&lt;/em&gt;” We’ve used that as a guiding principle. There have been a couple cases where we had a question, something came up–like, one of the musicians who’s selling lessons with us wanted to re-use his lesson as sort of a demo for a job he was trying to get that maybe was a little competitive with Soundslice and so we were faced with the question: Well, we did a bunch of work to help him get into Soundslice and now he’s going to use that and try to turn around to compete with us, and we made the decision…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;We look back at our fundamental principle: We help musicians.&lt;/span&gt; And we decided, “Of course we’ll help him do it.” We’re here to help musicians, not only the teachers who use us to teach their stuff, but the students who learn through our software. So, yeah, I completely see it as a tool &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; musicians first and foremost. It’s not about connecting with your fans or any of the stuff that a lot of other music companies do, especially in the internet startup world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;A lot of the music stuff is about streaming music or figuring out when bands are gonna be in your town or merchandise stuff. With us, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;we’re all about the musicians and actually learning music.&lt;/span&gt; We don’t know or care anything about gear. It’s just, literally, playing music. That’s a reflection of me, too, because I don’t know anything or care anything about gear or touring or merchandise or recording, I just care about playing good music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: What’s the response been from the musical community and your musician customers, the full-time musicians that are using Soundslice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AH: Man, it’s basically universally loved. It’s funny, when we get emails from people who just found out about us and more than half the time, they say, “How did I never know about this?!” It’s kind of a secret because we have done zero marketing and we’re super small potatoes so no one really knows about us. But yeah the response has been tremendous. People really, really like it. So, yeah, marketing suggestions welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Are there any musicians, like are you selling a lot content through lessons and these transcriptions? Or is it still kind of an up and coming thing as part of your business model?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AH: It’s somewhere in between up-and-coming and selling a lot. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I think if you asked the musicians who sell their lessons in the marketplace, they’d be very happy with the amount of money they’ve made so far.&lt;/span&gt; For instance, one of the people in the marketplace has been a professional musician since the 1970s. he’s done many albums, tours, instructional materials–you name it, he’s done it. He said after having launched his stuff on Soundslice for only a few days, “Wow, this in terms of return on investment for the amount of effort I had to make for the amount of money and just personal fulfillment I’ve gotten out of it is the best thing that I’ve ever done in my music career.” I gotta get him on video saying that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah, you do!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AH: From the teacher’s perspective for these lessons in the lesson marketplace, you record them once. And of course it takes some time to plan out your lessons plan and do the recording and all that, but from then on, you just sit back and watch the money come in and you’re done. It’s the whole “make money while you sleep” thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/oNl19ANnoW0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And of course the &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;students love it because it’s this unparalleled learning experience&lt;/span&gt; where you’ve got video of the instructor, they’ve got exactly what they’re playing synced with the video… it’s awesome! At a price point that’s less than an hour long lesson or workshop with the same exact person where you would get probably 5% of the content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: That’s an interesting thing. Can you tell us how much more rich an experience Soundslice is for students and teachers than just “here’s a book, study it” or “here’s a video, go watch it?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AH: Oh man… So the book… &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Book is the worst because you’re trying to describe something using the wrong sense.&lt;/span&gt; You’re trying to describe sound with sight! It doesn’t make any sense! That’s like writing an essay about a smell. It doesn’t make any sense at all. If you want to learn music, you’ve got to listen to it with your ears! That’s like my fundamental thing of Soundslice, the fundamental philosophy. So, learning from a book–bleh!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Caveat! I don’t want to go to extremes, so I’ll say the caveat is if you’re a professional musician or someone who’s majored in music and you really know your stuff, you can then maybe see something on paper and hear it in your head, or you’re just able to play it instantly. For that crowd, music on paper is totally fine. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;But for the 95% of us who are not like that, I don’t think it’s a good way of learning music.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And then just learning from videos, in comparison… If you learn from a YouTube video or a 1980s-style VHS tape, or an instructional DVD, it’s okay but it’s highly dependent upon the instructor and &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;it’s also highly inefficient in terms of the use of time.&lt;/span&gt; It also has problems with the interface, it’s very linear. I’ll take these one at a time. So, the ineffeciency. If you’re watching a DVD, you’ll see the instructor say, “Okay, we’re going to play this chord. First, you want to put your finger on the A string, 7th fret. Then you want to put this finger on the D string, 6th fret.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Compare that to Soundslice where the instructor assumes that you’re seeing the notation and the tab and the chord chart at the same exact time, so they don’t have to bother with any of that. So, it cuts down all that BS that’s really kind of a waste of time. So, that makes the lesson more efficient. And then, when it comes to the linear layout of video, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I want to be able to skip parts that I don’t care about.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;If I’m on YouTube, the way I do that is I take the tiny little playhead and move it forward. How far forward? I don’t know! I just kind of experiment and then see a split second of the video and see if the guy’s done talking about the boring thing that I don’t care about. But, if you have the Soundslice interface where it syncs the video with the notation, it doubles as navigation. So, you know &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; which moment the guy is finished talking with the thing you didn’t care about. It’s a better experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Plus, for the things like the geeky features like slowing down the video without changing pitch and looping sections, you couldn’t do that on VHS tape, maybe with some DVD players you can do looping, but it’s a &lt;em&gt;really horrible interface.&lt;/em&gt; Maybe you select a start point and then you have to watch it and then you hit the button at the stop point–&lt;em&gt;horrible interface&lt;/em&gt; compared to just dragging on the notation with perfect precision. So much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ahX8yJzJ2pA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: You haven’t talked about how musicians actually &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; Soundslice. It is a presentation and playback mechanism, but it is not a composition tool–you don’t draw out your notation within the app. So, how do people use Soundslice and get their sheet music and tablature into the app and then synchronize it with the video?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AH: You’re expected to create your notation in whatever program you’re already using to create the notation. So, that could be Sibelius, Finale, Guitar Pro, Musescore (which is free), Notion… Basically any notation program out there because all those programs export something called MusicXML, which is the file that you then put into Soundslice and then we just grab the notation out of there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And then when it comes to syncing it with real recordings, you have a bunch of different options. You can upload an MP3 to us, you can put in the YouTube URL, Vimeo, you can upload video directly to us as well. And then once you’ve either uploaded or pointed at that audio or video, you use our syncpoint editor, which is this web-based thing where we show you the notation and we show you the waveform and all you have to do is listen to the recording and tap your keyboard on the downbeat of every bar. If you make a mistake, you can just mess around with the sync points manually by dragging them around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZaZ1qu86YhM&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, hopefully it’s easy to use and intuitive. It handles any case of syncing that you would want. A lot of people assume when they first hear about our syncing, they think that, “Oh, that means my recording needed to be recorded with a metronome. My recording wasn’t recorded with a metronome, so it’s gonna break your system, right?” Like, almost wanting us to admit failure or something. But, no we handle that too because &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;you can put syncpoints wherever you want to put them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Even if there’s a fermata, a hold, or a pregnant pause in the music, you can have what we call inner-bar syncpoints where the first half of the bar is in time and then you can specify that the last two beats hang a little bit longer than just being strictly in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: How many people have thrown you scenarios at this point that have been like, “Oh my goodness, I had no idea people would do that!” Total surprises or things that have introduced what you thought should be functional and then you realize what you’ve done doesn’t support what they need… Those kinds of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AH: That happens all the time. I love that, frankly, because that’s my to-do list. That helps me prioritize what to do. My biggest challenge is when it comes to the product development, is prioritization. What do I work on next? I’ve got a huge list of stuff I want to add, but I don’t know what to do first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, basically, I was just chatting with a friend about this the other day. My little rubric is: the priority is decided 50% by paying customers, 10%-ish by potential paying customers, and then the remainder 40% by what I think would be good. Sort of my gut, what I want personally and what I think would be good. So, mostly driven by the paying customers. But, anyway, that doesn’t answer your question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;There are many cases where what people actually do with the software surprises me to the point where I have to fix it so it actually does what they want. That could be anything from the notation not supporting the things that they want to do to the way that they want to embed it into their site. Like when Guitar World Magazine started licensing our software, they put 8 Soundslice embeds in a single webpage. I had never actually tried that myself because I didn’t have a reason to and it turns out that web browsers have a limit on the number of audio players that they can have currently running and in Google Chrome that is 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, in that example with 8 players, the first 6 worked and then the second 2 didn’t work, so I had to fix that. So, yeah, you never know how people are going to use your stuff, but that’s the name of the game of making software for human users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/sDTZsOcc4sg&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: What does the future of the product look like? Do you have a vision of the product 8- to 12-months out where you want it to be?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AH: I don’t. I probably should, but I don’t think that long ahead. In 12 months from now–pfft, I have no idea what the world will be like. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;That’s like an eternity in Internet time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: What are some major features that you’re working on for Soundslice that you wouldn’t mind sharing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AH: So, one is offline mode, which I’ve been working on for a few weeks and it’s launching today. It will have launched by the time this gets posted. And, let’s see–at some point, I’d like there to be a notation editor, so you could just input the notation directly in Soundslice as opposed to having to use a separate program. I think that will start with the expectation that you’ll just use our notation editor to massage the notation that you’ve already imported in there in case there was some import errors or you want to make some changes without doing a round-trip back to your notation program. Of course, that’s a big project. [Laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;The biggest thing is getting more lessons in our marketplace and getting more teachers to use it. For almost two years now, I’ve been working non-stop on the product itself and it’s gotten to a point where it does 90% of what people want. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;It does 100% of what 90% of the people want.&lt;/span&gt; For those other 10% of people, they want it to do other stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Another ongoing thing is making the notation richer in terms of the types of notation it supports and making it look better and clearer and more beautiful. But, that’s just an ongoing thing. Every week we’re making improvements to that. That’s not the kind of thing where it’s particularly sexy to talk about. I’m not going to make a huge product announcement saying we tweaked our notation a little bit. That’s just par for the course to keep improving it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: That’s awesome, man. I can’t wait to see what you end up making and I’m really looking forward to the future of the product. I love using it and I love bugging you with the ways that I break it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AH: Yeah! Thank you thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Cool, well I think that’s a great breakdown of Soundslice. Is there anything else you want to say about the product?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AH: Huh. I probably should have something to say, but I’m not savvy enough to know what to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: All right, cool! If people want to reach out to you, you’re on social media. Everything is “soundslice,” right? Twitter.com/soundslice, all that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AH: Mm-hmm. Or just email: feedback at soundslice dot com or adrian at soundslice dot com. We read all those and respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Awesome. Thank you so much for your time, Adrian. I appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AH: Thank you thank you! See you online!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lyla by Avishai Cohen</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-we-learning&quot;&gt;What are we learning?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post explores a solo guitar arrangement I did of a beautiful song called &lt;em&gt;Lyla&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/avishai-cohen&quot;&gt;Avishai Cohen&lt;/a&gt;. The original recording features &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodes_piano&quot;&gt;Fender Rhodes keyboard &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, drums, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_bass&quot;&gt;upright bass &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, flute, and trumpet. I’m a sucker for moody songs played on the Rhodes (see also &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/gentle-giant&quot;&gt;Gentle Giant&lt;/a&gt;’s incredibly beautiful song, &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-power-and-the-glory/id731975200&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aspirations&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) and this song certainly fits that description.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was immediately attracted to this song when I first heard it a few years ago and it’s never quite left my short-term musical memory banks. At some point, I realized the sheet music for the song was available in Avishai’s online store, so I bought it and saw that it could probably be arranged into a nice solo guitar piece. It took over a year of sporadic effort to turn it into what we’ll cover in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/discover/avishai-cohen&quot;&gt;Check out our Discover post about Avishai Cohen!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;instructional-video&quot;&gt;Instructional Video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve put together an instructional video that illustrates everything in the charts below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/rrwgOFl2y9k&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sheet-music&quot;&gt;Sheet Music&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://soundslice.com&quot;&gt;Soundslice &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an incredible web app that offers HTML5 sheet music without the need for Adobe Flash or any other plugins. It’s super-duper awesome. Check it out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the score for performing &lt;em&gt;Lyla&lt;/em&gt; on guitar. It includes corrections by Forbes Henderson, which came after I recorded the video above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.soundslice.com/scores/36180/embed/&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you’re interested, here are the &lt;a href=&quot;http://musescore.org&quot;&gt;MuseScore &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and MusicXML files:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.rawgit.com/MakeWeirdMusic/assets/master/learn/lyla/lyla.mscz&quot;&gt;MuseScore (.mscz) &lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-download&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.rawgit.com/MakeWeirdMusic/assets/master/learn/lyla/lyla.xml&quot;&gt;MusicXML (.xml) &lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-download&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;structure&quot;&gt;Structure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two main parts to this arrangement (the original recording has 3 or 4 parts). There’s the opening section that’s fairly straightforward consisting of chord triads. I’ll call that ‘Part A’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second part, ‘Part B,’ is the part with the beautiful harmonic minor melody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;harmonic-minor&quot;&gt;Harmonic Minor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re unfamiliar with the harmonic minor scale, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale#Harmonic_minor_scale&quot;&gt;Wikipedia has a nice entry about it &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the scale that’s most often used to play Middle Eastern-sounding music. It’s a natural minor scale with a raised 7th note. Avishai plays with the scale in the Part B melody, but if you think of it as staying within B harmonic minor, you’ll be all right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a C major scale: C D E F G A B C&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a C natural minor scale: C D &lt;strong&gt;Eb&lt;/strong&gt; F G &lt;strong&gt;Ab&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Bb&lt;/strong&gt; C&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a C harmonic minor scale: C D Eb F G Ab &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; C&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice the 3rd, 6th, and 7th change between major and natural minor. Then notice that the 7th changes between the natural minor and the harmonic minor. Alternatively, the 3rd and 6th are the only notes that differ between a major and harmonic minor scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irrelevant conceptual question: Can you guess what a C harmonic major scale looks like based on the above information?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;performing-and-hands&quot;&gt;Performing and Hands&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll notice that left-hand fingerings are quite a stretch at times. Maintaining consistently solid notes is a huge challenge, as is playing the piece with continuity between measures. Part B relies on a series of minor 2nd intervals since it’s based in harmonic minor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part A has its own challenges, though. That stretch in measure 17 is a doozy to play smooth. Same with measure 18 and 19. Further beware of transitioning out of those little fills around the open high E string and effortlessly landing on that Bb major triad. Tough stuff!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_note&quot;&gt;grace notes &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the score. Those are the little notes with lines through them. They’re basically “notes of no rhythmic value.” In other words, play them as fast as you can before playing the following note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll also note some notes with “4:3” within brackets. This is a particular &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuplet&quot;&gt;tuplet &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; called a quadruplet. That means that 4 beats will replace 3 beats. In the case of this song, two quadruplet quarter notes are equal duration to a non-quadruplet dotted quarter note. Clear as mud, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this piece can be played with a pick, I recommend playing with fingers instead. It’s a little more sensible and this is a sensitive piece of music that can use the finesse and softness of fingers. I’m a self-avowed picking nerd and I can’t imagine wanting to play this piece with a pick. But, to each his/her own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the melody in Part B beginning on the 3rd beat of each measure, you’ll want to lead with the fingers that play the melody. I’ve indicated left hand fingerings with the little numbers near the note heads in the upper stave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;time-signature&quot;&gt;Time Signature&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The song is in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_metre&quot;&gt;the 3/4 time signature &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is normally pretty straightforward. What makes this song difficult from a time perspective is where the accents live in Part B. The melody begins on the 3 and the rhythm support is on 1 and 2. Traditional 3/4 songs usually have the melody begin on beat 1, but this song’s melody lives almost entirely within beat 3. Pretty interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Experience by Gentle Giant</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-we-learning&quot;&gt;What are we learning?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post contains a transcription I did of the intro to an incredible song called &lt;em&gt;Experience&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/gentle-giant&quot;&gt;Gentle Giant&lt;/a&gt;. This haunting bit of music has remained very close to my heart for many years. It is so unique and identifiable! The musical performance of the entire song is as stunning as the composition itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/experience/id731938339?i=731938359&quot;&gt;Purchase the song on iTunes &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SXSQ2Q&quot;&gt;Or, purchase the album on Amazon &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried learning the song a few years ago and was completely confounded. I simply could not figure out how it all worked! Thankfully, there was a generous effort by &lt;a href=&quot;http://richgoodhart.com/&quot;&gt;Rich Goodhart &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blazemonger.com/GG/Sheet_music&quot;&gt;a handwritten transcription &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It was difficult to believe the transcription was correct when I first looked it over because the sheet music looked too “straightforward.” Sure enough, it was right! The way the ostinato plays around with triplet rhythms… It’s inexplicably cool!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/interview/kerry-minnear&quot;&gt;Check out our interview with the songwriter, Kerry Minnear!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started learning the piece on piano and thought, “I wonder if this is playable on the guitar.” It sure was difficult coming up with something that made sense on the guitar, but I think I figured something playable out. There are some finger acrobatics on the left hand, but it stays relatively in the 7th, 3rd, and 1st positions. Pay particular attention to the left hand fingerings (those are the little numbers aligned with the notes on the upper staff).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;instructional-video&quot;&gt;Instructional Video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve put together an instructional video that illustrates everything I’m talking about. I play it slowly, then half-speed, then at tempo.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s super-duper awesome. Check it out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the score and tablature for the &lt;em&gt;Experience&lt;/em&gt; introduction. &lt;strong&gt;The time signatures are arbitrarily crazy&lt;/strong&gt; only because it seems to be how the intro was played. Most of the song is in 9/4 and 4/4 beyond the intro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the original band playing the song live (skip to 4:20 in the video), which is a bit different from the original studio release. I personally prefer the studio version for several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a great performance on the piano. It doesn’t capture the vocal melody, but that’s okay. It’s still fun to listen to and watch!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interview-transcript&quot;&gt;Interview transcript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;Anthony: Hi, this is Anthony from MakeWeirdMusic.com. I’m here with Paul Hanson. Paul, part of the mission of the site is to help musicians discover other great musicians who are doing new and different things. So, you’re a perfect candidate. Why don’t you tell us about yourself, a little of your musical history, and how you ended up where you are today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Paul: Okay, well, to make it short… Yes, I guess I’m best known as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bassoon&quot;&gt;bassoon &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; player (this instrument right here). Outside of classical music, I’d say jazz, fusion, funk, world music, contemporary classical music… I started at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley,_California&quot;&gt;Berkeley &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as a high school student playing saxophone in jazz groups and bassoon in classical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/1O9wZ_LbxGQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Somehow &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimi_Hendrix&quot;&gt;Jimi Hendrix &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; turned my head around and I started to think, “What is this great instrument that has all these great possibilities and different things it can do? &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Why can’t I go on stage and play with the band?&lt;/span&gt;” So, that’s kind of led to this. I have a career doing unusual music and I’d say unusual for the instrument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Tell us about that. What about your music is unusual for the bassoon?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;P: Well, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;usually bassoonists don’t improvise and they don’t amplify&lt;/span&gt;. It’s a classical instrument and a very classical in the sense that you’re very complementary in most performances. You are a supportive in a kind of mesh of an orchestra. You’re right between the high instruments and the low instruments. You’re kind of in the middle. You’re very homogenized as an orchestral bassoonist. As a chamber music instrument, usually you hear them in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivaldi&quot;&gt;Vivaldi &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concerto_grosso&quot;&gt;concerto grosso &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. You hear the soloist. In the bass part, you’ll hear basses, bassoons, harpsichords playing &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figured_bass#Basso_continuo&quot;&gt;continuo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;What I do that’s unusual is playing contemporary music. I play jazz, I’m pretty accomplished as a musician on this instrument in that style of music. So, you memorize tunes. Most bassoon players don’t do that. What you’re doing is you play in an orchestra, you play in a chamber ensemble, that kind of thing, and you certainly don’t play with drummers or guitar players. That’s usually what I’d call the unique thing that I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Can you tell us how you ended up bridging the gap from playing bassoon in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestra&quot;&gt;chamber or orchestra ensemble &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;P: Yeah, well, this is the thing that’s where you’re young, you’re headstrong, you have all these ideas, and sometimes later in life you wonder: “Hmm… Did I really have to get that stubborn?” People have said, “You couldn’t do it [Play jazz on bassoon]. You’re not supposed to do that.” My teacher in conservatory was a fantastic teacher, I used to look up to him. I still look up to him today. When I had some lessons with him, I would be improvising in the lesson. He’d pop his head out when he was getting his coffee or something and say, “What’s that you’re playing?” I’d say, “Well, I just made it up.” And this happened all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/xCXoCC83Y14?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Every [jazz] instrument you play, you have an improvising tradition. I grew up in Berkeley, went to Berkeley High, was in the jazz band there. It was a very well-known jazz program in the 1970s. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I thought &lt;em&gt;everybody&lt;/em&gt; improvised.&lt;/span&gt; You make up things, you play with people, it’s part of making music. So, when I found out that that’s not at all what the tradition’s about [on bassoon]…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And also at the time, I hadn’t gotten some of the things I was looking for in classical music as a young person. I was very into &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven&quot;&gt;Beethoven&lt;/a&gt; string quartets and very &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_music&quot;&gt;Romantic &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; amazing music. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cello&quot;&gt;Cellos &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were playing and at that time I didn’t see much music like that on the bassoon, although there was and it wasn’t hitting me yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, I thought, “You know, I just want to go out there and play with somebody.” It was something like, “Wow, no one’s ever done that.” I felt that this was something I could do and I enjoyed doing it. It wasn’t that hard to me, to a certain extent. I realized there was a lot of work involved, of course, but it was just a challenge to say, “Wow, this could be something that I love. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;It’s fun because nobody’s done this.&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Also, I had a friend who was playing in the band who could play just about every instrument and the one instrument I knew he was never going to play was bassoon, so I said, “You know what? I’ll do the thing he can’t do.” It’s just the challenge that “something hasn’t happened on this instrument.” That’s kind of what I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/gi3GP3950KA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: What led to it becoming something you could do to make money?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;P: Well, you start playing with people. Some of those very friends–they were young musicians, we had a band, people started hearing about me and networking when I was younger (I was probably a better networker then)–I was playing saxophone in many other bands, too. I also play tenor and alto saxophones. “You should hear this guy on bassoon.” And I’d say, “Oh sure, I’ll bring it down and hook it up.” Then, “Oh, it sounds good!” once I started playing the parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I started playing in Latin bands, salsa bands, Latin jazz. People enjoyed the sound of the instrument, not just as a soloist instrument, but also in a section in how it blends. That kept leading to different things. I played with a group called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Apfelbaum&quot;&gt;Peter Apfelbaum &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;’s Hieroglyphics Ensemble. We made a few records for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_Records&quot;&gt;Island Records &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; back in the early 1990s. They were a pretty big band in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area&quot;&gt;Bay Area &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at the time. I had a forum to play with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I made a transition–a conscious decision–to go after it. It sometimes would involve going to jam sessions or going to a place where people would invite you to play and &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I’d bring my bassoon and they’d say, “What the hell is that thing?”&lt;/span&gt; And just the weirdest faces and you’re hoping that you sound right and they’re going to hear the instrument. I had a few forums when I was younger to get better, including a steady jazz gig where I played bassoon as well as sax. I alternated on the point of being a saxophone player who also plays bassoon versus a bassoon player who also plays sax. So, I just put myself in that position. Things had to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Back 25 years ago, I guess fusion music was more prevalent. You could play in local clubs doing it more often. Now it’s a long local level. It’s musician music, so it’s never been something that the numbers are too big, unless you’re playing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_Jazz&quot;&gt;smooth jazz &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; stuff, which is a different kind of feel. So, we’re playing at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshi%27s_(jazz_club)&quot;&gt;Yoshi’s &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in a band with some friends twice a month, I think. Nowadays, you wouldn’t be able to play as a local group that often. It was more of a local club at the time. Getting better, listening to people. I was getting paid there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I was also getting paid as part of a group called the Paul Dresher Ensemble. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dresher&quot;&gt;Paul Dresher &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a musician who went to San Diego State or University of San Diego… He’s kind of more of a contemporary person, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams_(composer)&quot;&gt;John Adams &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Reich&quot;&gt;Steve Reich &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, kind of that style. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_music&quot;&gt;Minimalist &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but really good stuff. It wasn’t minimalist to the point of 15 minutes of the same thing over and over again. It was a modified minimalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I was in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dresherensemble.org/&quot;&gt;Paul Dresher Ensemble&lt;/a&gt; group from 1991 to 2002 and during that time, that’s what I did. Each one of us in that group had a lot of things to pull from. I was an electric bassoonist, so I had effects on the floor and the rack, and a mixer, and we had someone conducting, we had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI_beat_clock&quot;&gt;MIDI clock&lt;/a&gt;. We had the whole thing worked out and we did a bunch of touring and we went to Japan. We went all over the United States. There was a great production called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dresherensemble.org/newmusictheater/ravenshead.html&quot;&gt;Ravenshead&lt;/a&gt;, which is a single person opera, which won the best new opera of 1998, I think, by USA Today. So, it was a really great group for a long time. That was something that was making money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;That also helped me at the time to continue to focus on playing with other people. As I played saxophone for many years in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_jazz&quot;&gt;acid jazz &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; group in the 1990s playing tenor, I also had this bassoon thing going. I got signed to a record contract with a Japanese jazz label called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.makimusic.net&quot;&gt;Moo Records &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; out of Winnetka, California, I think. Sold a bunch of records. Did a record with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Erskine&quot;&gt;Peter Erskine &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Bromberg&quot;&gt;Brian Bromberg &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Power#David_Garibaldi&quot;&gt;David Garibaldi &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gs88oXmXIeI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I had a band here and we started playing &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_Bulgaria&quot;&gt;Bulgarian music &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, believe it or not. I was playing clarinet in a group called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Klezmorim&quot;&gt;Klezmorim &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We were touring Europe all the time and we were really fascinated by the crazy wedding band music that you saw on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Sanborn&quot;&gt;David Sanborn &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; show. The Bulgarian crazy stuff. It was three clarinetists, a tuba player, and David Garibaldi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: The drummer from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Power&quot;&gt;Tower of Power &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;P: Yeah. I know him very well. He’s on at least two or three of my records. We used to have a band together. David and I, &lt;a href=&quot;http://norbertstachel.com&quot;&gt;Norbert Stachel &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (a fantastic session player who lives in New York now), I think &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.peterhorvath.com/bio.html&quot;&gt;Peter Horvath &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was in it. A bunch of people. This was kind of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_fusion&quot;&gt;fusion &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; period here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;We had really great gigs and somebody approached me after one of our gigs and said, “I think I can get you a recording contract.” It was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otmaro_Ru%C3%ADz&quot;&gt;Otmaro Ruiz &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the great pianist who used to play with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arturo_Sandoval&quot;&gt;Arturo Sandoval &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dianne_Reeves&quot;&gt;Dianne Reeves &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and all kinds of people. He’s a fantastic musician and he was the one who got me signed. So, I had a four or five record deal with him, or something like that, back when record deals happened. They were released in Japan and we got to be released over here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I entered a competition and was chosen to be part of this international jazz competition. I won the grand prize of a woodwinds competition playing the best woodwind jazz of 1995 or something like that. It was my record and it was really nice. I was playing locally, doing all kinds of different things. To kind of give you the whole story as it goes, there was always money involved. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Nowadays you have to pay to do records, but back then, they had budgets.&lt;/span&gt; So, I got budgets, I got royalties and all that kind of stuff. It got played and I got paid to do those albums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, between that and local gigs, playing with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dresher&quot;&gt;Paul Dresher &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Ensemble, occasional classical gigs, which I hardly ever did and I still don’t do very much, saxophone work, that’s how I got through. Long answer, huh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: You kind of just inserted the fact that you were doing acid jazz stuff with the amplified bassoon…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;P: I did a little bit. I was more of a saxophone player because I was always in a band called What It Is. I played with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Hunter&quot;&gt;Charlie Hunter &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a little bit. It was a big scene around here at that time. A lot of things going on in the Bay Area. There was a group called James T… What was it called? I can’t remember the name of it. [NOTE: It was called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scottamendola.com/bands/tjkirk.html&quot;&gt;T.J. Kirk &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;] A band that combined &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Brown&quot;&gt;James Brown &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelonious_Monk&quot;&gt;Thelonius Monk &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; together. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Bernard&quot;&gt;Will Bernard &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Charlie Hunter, and I still play with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.johnschott.com&quot;&gt;John Schott &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He was actually involved in the gig on the small poster [points behind himself]. A Jewish music event. So, I did a little of that back then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Basically, I’d just show up with my gear. I had a little more gear than I have now. And I wiped out the audience, I guess, by playing bassoon with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_shift&quot;&gt;harmonizer &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, effects, and stuff like that. It’s just like, “What the hell is that?” Often it was good. Earlier story… I was in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Conservatory_of_Music&quot;&gt;New England Conservatory &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I had a little &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wollensak&quot;&gt;Wollensak &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reel to reel tape recorder that had the greatest preamp in the world. It was like, “Whoa, this sounds so great.” You know… Tubes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I had an old &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Jazz_Chorus&quot;&gt;Roland Jazz Chorus &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; amp, which I still have. I put the microphone down my bassoon, completely down in here [points to the basson about 16 inches from the top soundhole], which you’re not supposed to do. I put it in the Wollensak and put it in the amp and just shredded in the practice rooms. They said later on that people used to line up three deep trying to figure out what the hell was going on in there. Of course I didn’t have any real ability on it. I was just flailing, but it was fun. Some things were good, but that was back in 1980 or 1981.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;In the mid 1990s, it was kind of when the fusion thing kind of stopped happening. It wasn’t as poppy. It had this kind of new acid jazz thing, so there had to be some authenticness, like it had to sound like older school kind of guys. So, all that bassoon stuff… Acid jazz was more saxophone stuff and I would say the more contemporary–I don’t know, it was kind of a combination of things. For bands I never played bassoon in, some bands I just played sax. But, it was kind of a mix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Were you influenced by anyone in particular? Or was this kind of your own trailblazing thing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;P: Oh yeah. A lot of people influenced me. As a horn player, there’s all kinds of great jazz soloists like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Parker&quot;&gt;Charlie Parker &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Coltrane&quot;&gt;John Coltrane &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexter_Gordon&quot;&gt;Dexter Gordon &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Davis&quot;&gt;Miles Davis &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, many people who made beautiful phrases. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;The bassoon is a beautiful phrasing instrument&lt;/span&gt;, actually. It’s not a noodling shredding instrument. I do some of that kind of stuff, but it’s really about making a phrase and singing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;The bassoon is really about singing voice. Coming up with phrases that stick. So, those were influences to me. I say &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bach&quot;&gt;Bach &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a big influence, of course. He is for a lot of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/6NH_lwHfrNE&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Hendrix was a huge influence because, when I say Hendrix, it’s because there’s things that a bassoon–you’re playing in one kind of key that sounds very much like–you can bend notes because it’s got things like… You have holes and you can partially cover them and you can do things with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiphonic&quot;&gt;multiphonics &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that are kind of mistakes. You can hit more than one note at once and they sound mellow on this instrument as opposed to grating. You can kind of slide them down, you can do things that sound like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigiTech_Whammy&quot;&gt;whammy pedal &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; stuff. Also, you can play bass lines and you can play high up, to a certain degree. That’s what kind of got me going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It just sounds like a really bizarre marriage there, but it works out that way for some reason. E is a fantastic key to play on bassoon. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_minor&quot;&gt;E minor &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; just is great. It’s the guitar player key. So, it was funny because I play a lot of guitar player keys. “You’re a horn player. I thought you play Bb and Eb.” “No no. That’s fine I can do everything. Go for your guitar keys. Fine.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;All kinds of things are musically interesting to me. I just had a drive to continue to work and play and certain people heard me and they wanted me to play. Like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_McCandless&quot;&gt;Paul McCandless &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; had me play on a record in the early 1990s, I think. He had heard me on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Cardenas_(musician)&quot;&gt;Steve Cardenas &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Steve Cardenas is a great guitar player from New York. Great jazz player. Fantastic. He plays with tons of people. I’m not sure who exactly at the moment. He was recording my first album for the Japanese jazz record label.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;He was playing his tape, because back then there were cassettes, on a tour with Paul McCandless and Paul McCandless heard it and said, “Who is that?” And Paul McCandless is, you know, a great oboist. So, he had invited me not only to get to the connection with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Double_Reed_Society&quot;&gt;International Double Reed Society &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is a society that puts on conventions. I was able to go in 1995 to play in Holland and play jazz with the rhythm section there and play for bassoonists and oboists and that was a real big event because people hadn’t really heard anything like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/GAe0_n97PGw&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I’ve always had a relationship with them since then. I do workshops and master classes and I know a lot of bassoon teachers and stuff. That world has gotten me involved. And, like anybody, when someone hears you, they can help you, you owe a lot to them. Paul introduced me to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Béla_Fleck_and_the_Flecktones&quot;&gt;Flecktones &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;After playing a casual one day, I went to the Warfield here or something like that. I sat in with the Flecktones, I think, in 1998 and then 1999. Then I also ended up working with the drummer, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Man&quot;&gt;Future Man &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He had a little orchestra playing bizarre, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtonal_music&quot;&gt;microtonal music &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It was funky, but it was microtonal and I had to come up with new fingerings and stuff like that. He’s something else. He’s a fantastic musician, but he’s on a different plane of reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I was in Nashville quite a bit, playing with people there. There’s a lot of great musicians down there. It’s a very different feel, in some ways, than here in California because the cost of living is nowhere near. Through hook and by crook, I think I was playing at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAMM_Show&quot;&gt;NAMM show &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 1999. Things developed and then they asked me to play in the band. So, I played for a few years off and on with Paul, me, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Narell&quot;&gt;Andy Narell &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and a Tuvan throat singer, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kongar-ol_Ondar&quot;&gt;Kongar-Ol &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. There’s videos of that, there’s all kinds of stuff from that. That was a big moment. I’m talking so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: That’s the point! I want to hear you! No one wants to hear me. You’ve worked with a lot of amazing artists. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonas_Hellborg&quot;&gt;Jonas Hellborg &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Béla_Fleck&quot;&gt;Béla Fleck &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and I love how you’re kind of casual about, “Well, this led to another thing.” Are people attracted to when they hear the bassoon? They say, “I’ve never heard anything like this before,” and they reach out to you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;P: Yeah. It happens a lot. It doesn’t happen quite as much anymore because I’m not as young and I’m not as active going out to play with people. And I was gone a long time with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirque_du_Soleil&quot;&gt;Cirque du Soleil &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I was in a show of theirs. So, the period after the Flecktones… One of the things that I say to any musician is, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;“Do you ever feel like you’ve ever made it?” Because you never do. You’ve always got to keep making it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Playing with the Flecktones was always kind of a dream I never imagined. I kind of hoped, but I never thought it would get to that point. But, it actually did. So, when it happens, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;the reward is not the fact that you got there. The reward is the fact that you get a chance to continue to do that.&lt;/span&gt; So, I had some different projects after that point. There’s a band called &lt;a href=&quot;https://zenithpatrol.bandcamp.com/releases&quot;&gt;Zenith Patrol &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I was in, made a couple of records. One’s on Bandcamp, I think, called VU. The drummer from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mars_Volta&quot;&gt;Mars Volta &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;’s on it, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Pridgen&quot;&gt;Thomas Pridgen &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He’s a fantastic drummer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/IKSdJFIJ01g&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, there’s a period there where I found the right thing to capitalize on that. And we had kids at that point. A good friend of mine who’s in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee&quot;&gt;Nashville &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, from here but in Nashville, had gotten an audition with a really unique company at the time. This was 10 years ago. He told me about it and he said, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;“You should probably audition for them. You might find yourself.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So I went to Los Angeles. This was after playing with Jonas Hellborg. We’d played together with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Sipe&quot;&gt;Jeff Sipe &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Jonas had a thing with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Lane&quot;&gt;Shawn Lane &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the great guitar player. I wasn’t supposed to–there’s no way you can replace someone like that. Nobody can replace him. But, they wanted something new, something different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;We tried for a little while. We didn’t go on for too long. We made one record, but it was very organic working with Jonas. Improvisation-based. I had all my effects going. And Jeff, I did a few things with Jeff Sipe. I think &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Coffin&quot;&gt;Jeff Coffin &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was involved with one of the things. We had a little trio. There’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abstractlogix.com/xcart/product.php?productid=20834&quot;&gt;a record &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; out there, a few YouTube clips. That happened for a little while, 2003-2004, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I was also playing with a band called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.davkamusic.com&quot;&gt;Davka &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which a lot of people don’t know about, which is a sort of Middle Eastern, Jewish-but-yet-Palestinian music kind of thing. Beautiful music from the Middle East. A cellist named &lt;a href=&quot;http://mosessedler.net&quot;&gt;Moses Sedler &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; who lives here and went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Akbar_College_of_Music&quot;&gt;Ali Akbar Khan School of Music &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.klezmerfiddle.com/Klezmer_Fiddle/Klezmer_Fiddle.html&quot;&gt;Daniel Hoffman &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a fantastic violinist, a guy who lives in Israel. &lt;a href=&quot;http://stolaf.academia.edu/KevinMummey&quot;&gt;Kevin Mummey &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who’s our dumbek player. Now he teaches history in Minnesota. And me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/qzAb2H9BwNQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, we had kind of thing going on here, where this is a great area to be part of creating music at the time. It still is, even though it’s not like it used to be. There’s a bunch of different things I was playing bassoon in. I also taught music down at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ithaca_College_School_of_Music&quot;&gt;Ithaca School of Music &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for a year. I was a bassoon professor. They needed somebody to take over for a colleague of mine, so I did. It was great fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I was thinking of going more into education, too. When you have a family, it changes a lot of things in a good way and also makes it so you have to make more money. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Sometimes things could be really great for a while when you’re a unique instrumentalist, but it’s not like everyone’s looking for one of these in a band.&lt;/span&gt; If there was! That’s not the way it is. You have to create all your stuff. YouTube’s starting, Facebook, all this stuff. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;You have to figure out how you’re going to market yourself and you’re getting older and stuff.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, about 2004, I auditioned for Cirque, went down to LA did some blowout, I don’t know what I did… Improvised with loops and effects and crazy playing. I also had my tenor. So, I did a combination of things and then I got cast for a show about 10 years ago. It was a great experience. Both shows were great. The first show was called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saltimbanco&quot;&gt;Saltimbanco &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where I played tenor, alto, soprano, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EWI_(musical_instrument)&quot;&gt;EWI &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, keyboards, percussion, and bassoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And they never had a bassoon in there. They had a horrible &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI&quot;&gt;MIDI &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; bassoon part. So I played it. There’s a picture on one of my Facebook pages of all of my instruments. It was crazy. It was a fantastic show. We’d play on the side when we had time. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;We were playing 380 shows a year, just an amazing amount of shows.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It was great because you have benefits. If you’re a reesponsible adult and you have kids, you have to have healthcare for the whole family and everything like that. You’d get massages every week as part of the deal. They treat you really well. The show they had me in mind for was on bassoon primarily in a show called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zed_(Cirque_du_Soleil)&quot;&gt;Zed &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which was in Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;A beautiful story. No one even knows about it. There’s a DVD or something out about it. It’s a fantastic show that should have really had more of a chance out here. It was supposed to be in Disneyland in California, but they balked. Land owners in Tokyo, that Disney, wanted it. Called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oriental_Land_Company&quot;&gt;Oriental Land Company &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it’s a 400 year old land company with oodles of money. So, they bought the show and made a theater. The theater cost $100 million and so here I am moving to Japan, my daughter’s 6, my son’s 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;My wife, she has an orchestral career as well as working at the place she works. She left that, it’s incredible. It was tough for her to do that, but she did and we lived in Japan for four years. It was an amazing experience. I played on the side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wz3LeH8PPGE&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;We had a group called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/Mean-Green-289913964441/&quot;&gt;Mean Green &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It was me, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ableton_Live&quot;&gt;Ableton &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;–our friend Ableton–and a guitarist, Patrick Kelly, our drummer, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rhythmicvisions.com/ronwagner.html&quot;&gt;Ron Wagner &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. There’s a few videos. We never made any albums, but we had some fun. We had no time to record. We were just working 5 or 6 days a week. That kind of put a dent in my career. I’d been signed, I had a record on &lt;a href=&quot;http://abstractlogix.com&quot;&gt;Abstract Logix &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; records called &lt;a href=&quot;https://abstractlogix.bandcamp.com/album/frolic-in-the-land-of-plenty&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frolic in the Land of Plenty&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/tuZmArruc0o?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I love that album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;P: Me too. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;They had a whole promotional campaign made, just like what you’d want from a record label. It doesn’t trump a really big job, so I took the job.&lt;/span&gt; I wouldn’t say I regret it because it was a great experience being over there and a great country to live in, an incredible cultural experience, doing good for the family…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It was great, but it was an interesting time. People who were just all about the music said, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;“How could you have gone to work for a circus?” Well, you know, a lot of money and great treatment really go a long way&lt;/span&gt;, and at the same time there were some really great musicians. We got to play on the side and do other things. I played with a great painter who does things with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinnie_Colaiuta&quot;&gt;Vinnie Colaiuta &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;… &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/VisibleSoundByTomReyes/&quot;&gt;Tom Reyes &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He’s a fantastic freeform painter. There’s a few video clips of us on YouTube and we’re throwing down doing some great stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: That’s great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;P: Long answers. Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Please make them as long as necessary. You also write original music. How did that start?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;P: I always wrote my own music. I always liked the idea of being a composer, but for the jazz records I did, it was important that I wrote music because they wanted original stuff. I don’t have much piano skills, but I hear the kind of things I wanted to play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I worked with other musicians and there’s something that develops over time from hearing things that you like that kind of come into ideas of your own. You see where things go. Sometimes things’ll be written on an instrument, sometimes things’ll just be written in your head without any drum machine or loop or tempo or something like that. I don’t even know how it starts. Creativity is so hard to figure out how. Something that can be sung…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/AuWq3S4SlaY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I always like melodies that can be sung. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I like intricacy and stuff, but melodies that can be sung are the best for me.&lt;/span&gt; I don’t even know how, in terms of the composition. I just listen to people, study a few things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;When I was in school I studied Bach’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg_Concertos&quot;&gt;Brandenburg Concertos &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and how they were put together. The form is amazing! These forms were not improvising, but it’s kind of like a tuning session where everyone’s playing and jamming together and then break off for a few bars. Nothing’s 8, 8, 8, 8. Everything’s 5, 2, 3, and then 1. Different ways of getting around things. It’s really fascinating how that basically grew bass music because Bach has a groove to it. It’s consistent. It’s not romantic music where you stop and hold. It’s, of course, not a judgment, but the truth of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Noise heard in the background.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Every time we do something down here, I can always tell my son’s there because there’s always sound coming down. Something dropping down the stairs…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: My kids are 4, 6, and 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;P: Oh how fun! They’re a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel_of_Monkeys_(game)&quot;&gt;barrel of monkeys &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;P: It’s great. It’s cool. He used to play drums. Hopefully he’ll play more at some point. There’s a video of us playing &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unchained_(song)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unchained&lt;/em&gt; by Van Halen &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He’s playing drums and I’m on guitar. That was my first instrument, actually, it was the guitar. I have a Strat over there. So, I’d pick up the guitar, put things together, and think “Oh, this sounds cool.” I’d work out a guitar part. I had a duo with a guitarist who tried to figure out things and I’m trying to figure out…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It helps to have it in your hands to figure out how you can cover as much as you can so you know what you’re giving the person to play. “Don’t just strum something.” I guess with composition it’s hard to determine. It’s just part of creativity and part of–I think less something you want to play over as much as something you just feel should be written down because it feels nice to play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;There’s some new things we’re working on. I did some solo albums last year for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Coast_Records&quot;&gt;Blue Coast Records &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and there’s a few things on there that are based on little loops I set up on bassoon and looped myself on top of it and then I play something over it. Actually, &lt;a href=&quot;http://oonband.com&quot;&gt;Oon &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we’re going to be doing a version of one of those tunes at least. Some new things coming out. Working on a bunch of different things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/mabjALyZC5A?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I don’t know. It’s so hard to describe the creative process, but it’s different than improvising. It’s more permanent. It feels more like you’re chipping away at the marble until you see the sculpture there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: And you use Ableton?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;P: I have. I use mainly &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_Pro&quot;&gt;Logic &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I’m mainly into Logic. I use Ableton a little bit. Ableton is just so dense. It’s incredible. The guys out there that are great loopers make great use of it. It’s just like, “My God!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;One of my favorite bands is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knower_(band)&quot;&gt;Knower &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. You know Knower? Oh, you &lt;em&gt;gotta&lt;/em&gt; hear these guys. The drummer is fantastic. He does everything and I guess his girlfriend or wife sings. They’re fantastic. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.timlafave.com&quot;&gt;Tim LeFebvre &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;’s played with them some. I’m just horrible at remembering things at the time, but I’m sure you’ve heard them. They do amazing covers, people on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_Loops&quot;&gt;Dirty Loops &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;P: A little bit like Dirty Loops in the harmonic sense, but more techno because there’s only two people. They did a really good one of &lt;em&gt;Get Happy&lt;/em&gt;. I can’t remember if that’s the name of the tune. Not &lt;em&gt;Happy&lt;/em&gt;, not the big hit. Not Pharrell, but something earlier that he did. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_Lucky_(Daft_Punk_song)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Get Lucky&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;They did a great job of that. Some other &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellie_Goulding&quot;&gt;Elaine Goulding &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; stuff. Is that her name? Elena Goulding? Something like that. I can find them and you should check them out. Just ridiculous. They’re based in LA. He plays that “push” thing. The grid and he is just ridiculous and fantastic. Making great music, pop, very harmonically–oh my God, just incredible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xdkou0CxS8I?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Dirty Loops is just another fantastic group. Just incredible. So, I don’t get to that level with the stuff yet. I’ve thought about it when I did things with my friend in Ableton, but it was very simple. We have some parts to play along with our song that we don’t want a whole band for. We just use it for parts of the tune.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;We never got in as much as you could. But since Ableton is so in use in a lot of the shows these days, like Cirque, it came natural to use it as a tool for us. We put some crazy sounds in there once in a while when we’d get to a section where a drummer hits a trigger and there goes a crazy sound. Something where you use technology to your advantage. Similar to using pedals to create chords or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: What is your process like? You used Logic, but what does that mean to you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;P: I use Logic basically in composing. Like, if I want to use, for example, something I’m writing–I’ve been commissioned (of all things, someone &lt;em&gt;asked&lt;/em&gt; for this) on SoundCloud. Basically, it’s got a drum loop or some kind of drum percussion kind of a thing, effected bassoons, and some kind of bass line. A lot of my stuff is techno-oriented or influenced, I’d say. So, I would never call myself anywhere near the league of people who are doing that stuff these days. They’ve really got their stuff down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But, it’s all a tool. It’s in my mind that even if I put these crude little–to me, the quality is okay, it’s just some laptop right there, I just spit it out, and it’s entertaining to people because I play the bassoon and I play with effects, sometimes in Logic or something like that…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;You know, little tunes that have melodies, me playing over it, things that I can do in there. It’s a process that I use. So, we had something in Japan where I played a tune that was on &lt;em&gt;Frolic in the Land of Plenty&lt;/em&gt;. I had to put bassoon loops into Ableton. I was playing the keyboard part on the bassoon, looping this really crazy part and there’s no way to play it at the same time with the melody on the bassoon, so I had multiple bassoons in Ableton at certain times to come in for certain parts of the tune. It was just a great tool like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/UQzsICEebnI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I guess you could have put it on the floor in some kind of device, too, but Ableton is king of all that stuff. In Logic, it’s just stuff for writing. Sometimes I take advantage of the processing that’s there. I take advantage of it just to get some ideas out and some things as well as a person like a do-it-yourself-er can engineer that will just sort of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But someone asked me to commission a piece for bassoon and electronic. So, electronic-based driven music with loops. What I’m hoping to do is take somebody–once I’m done with the piece–to remix the sounds and spruce it up so it’s really–I know some people who are very good with sound quality ideas. They can help with that stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Do you lay down tracks without using structure? Like, do you set tempo, do you set the key, do you compose…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;P: I don’t just improvise, but I think in my idea, “Oh, this’d be really cool.” I get the nugget and I know where I can kind of go after that. Like right now, this guy was asking for a particular tune that had some things he liked about aspects of my music. So, I came up with something similar to what he’s thinking, I think, and he digs it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I had kind of a very academic thought, “Oh, it’s this kind of piece. I’ll put a very academic-sounding &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-tone_technique&quot;&gt;12-tone &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; thing in the beginning.” And he didn’t like it, which is totally cool. I didn’t like it either. So, it doesn’t have to be “academic,” it just has to be music. Just thinking of the things I like to hear, really cool stuff out there, like the Knowers of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;When I say “Knower,” it sounds like I’m saying “nowhere,” but I mean Knower and Dirty Loops and these people with really advanced harmonic senses with very singable melody and they take advantage of all the advanced harmonic trainings out there. Plus all the different sounds that are out there with the techno stuff, which is really incredible. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_and_bass&quot;&gt;Drum and bass &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, all the different styles. My son likes a lot of video game music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Oh, yeah. Like the 8-bit techno music?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;P: All kinds of different stuff. I’m doing an approximation because I don’t have the world’s most incredible studio. It’s kind of embarrassing there’s this amazing sound out there and I’m just using this laptop. It’s amazing how many things in this world, that’s what it is. It’s kinda scary. Might as well get in there too and share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: As a person who plays a very unique instrument like the bassoon, is there a part of your identity that says, “I want to be that guy that’s different?” Has there always been a spirit in there…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;P: Yes, for sure. I could have made it a lot easier on myself in some ways by just following the rules. I was very talented as a classical bassoon player. I could definitely see it all coming where I’d be in a section playing the parts of people that I know, doing what they’re doing…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I should have taken advantage of that stuff at the time as it was happening, but &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;when you’re young and you’re about the music, for some reason, there’s just something in you wanting to do something different.&lt;/span&gt; I was also playing back in the mid-80s. I was playing a lot of saxophone. I still do, but not nearly as much as I did back then. I played with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Money&quot;&gt;Eddie Money &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take_Me_Home_Tonight_(song)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Take Me Home Tonight&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, there’s a big solo in that. That’s me. So, last year, I started to get, “Where’d these royalties come from?” Then I thought, “Oh, that’s right! Yeah.” Because they didn’t used to report these types of performances as anything you could get a royalty for, but I got something for some kind of subsect of a guild or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/edFWRm_Ul7k?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But, yeah, I played with him, I played with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boz_Scaggs&quot;&gt;Boz Scaggs &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I did a whole bunch of things as a professional horn player. It’s just the kind of thing where I thought, “Well, let’s see what kinds of things you can do with this instrument.” By the 1990s, I started making a decision, “You could be like everybody else or…. Why don’t I at least try this?” I enjoyed it. I enjoyed playing the bassoon in a different way. It just felt…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;The thrill you get from the sound of an instrument you really like to play and playing with other people that inspire you and matching their intensity or being a part of it is a great feeling. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;When I say “match intention,” I mean in a co-mingling way that creates this huge, big thing that everybody’s getting something from.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s a great feeling, you know. Of course, I love being part of a team also. It’s not just about me, I don’t want it to be just me me me me me. I want to be part of a collaboration with other people. And in situations where we’re bringing something great together. That can happen all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I was part of the SF Jazz here in the city as part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sfjazz.org/content/50th-anniversary-duke-ellingtons-concert-sacred-music&quot;&gt;Duke Ellington 50th Anniversary performance &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of his &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Ellington%27s_Sacred_Concerts&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sacred Music&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is amazing music. Back in the 1960s, jazz was not thought of academically at all. It was still “bastard music” kind of. It had gotten further, but when they tried to get art endowments to try fund it, they totally turned Ellington down. Duke Ellington! They turned him down!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/r8T5-AxBUwI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Now, jazz is a totally different type of music. It’s very–I wouldn’t say well-endowed, but it’s become more like classical music where you have endowments and you have the whole funding apparatus going on. A lot of things happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, this time we played, I guess this was September, a totally different situation. I was playing bassoon in that group. It was a group of fantastic musicians. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_Zenón&quot;&gt;Miguel Zenón &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and some other &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SFJAZZ_Collective&quot;&gt;SF Jazz &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; people in a really supportive role. I was just playing a section, but again when you’re part of something really big, you get that feeling, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;you get the chills in your back, you’re part of something.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;That’s kind of where you want to be as a musician. Adding to, not subtracting from.&lt;/span&gt; Why not try to take the plunge and do something to the instrument that brings something else out? That’s kind of what happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Along the way I found that there were more people before me that were trying to do certain similar kind of things. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindsay_Cooper&quot;&gt;Lindsay Cooper &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, some other bassoon players that I found out were jazz musicians. I know of a few right now. Like the woman in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moulettes&quot;&gt;Moulettes &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of all things, you know. Awesome! Awesome to see them out there playing! I’m always hearing from people all over the place, like, “Whoa, I’m a really big fan of yours. Thank you for influencing me!” That’s surreal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/F1-pj1Wt7eE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Did it ever go wrong? Did you bring the bassoon and people go, “What is he doing?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;P: I’ve had a couple of times where it went wrong where I just didn’t get the sound right or something like that. A couple times, you know. Sometimes it has gone wrong when you try to overthink it too much. If you don’t hear it loud enough, it’s like, “Well, nice but…” You gotta hear the bassoon loud enough over the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Sometimes you have to orchestrate it when you’re playing with a whole bunch of other instruments. You have to find that right volume level where you can be present, you can hear the whole instrument. Sometimes people think they hear you playing, but it’s just a background voice and they don’t really hear it. But, you know, it hasn’t gone wrong in quite a while. Any musician has good or bad days, I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So you’ve learned to evolve your voice and to adapt to musical contexts in a way that people probably go, “That’s great.” You’ve crossed several genres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;P: The biggest thing that happens, and it’s not really a reward, but it’s part of it… &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;People just play with me because they play music a certain way.&lt;/span&gt; It’s not about, “Oh, it’s on a bassoon.” I guess part of it is that, but they don’t know that the instrument is not designed to do that at all. They just go, “Oh, that sounds really good!” It sounds like any horn player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Many people will sometimes say, “Great sax playing!” If you’re just duplicating what a saxophone has done, maybe it’s not the job. That’s why I go for all the different sounds. I go for techno stuff, more acoustic things sometimes. I try to find something that reflects on this instrument in a way that “this is really what it is.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;As I get older, the biggest thing is… You know Oon, this musical group I have a CD of for you. It’s just bass and bassoon, so you’re really pretty naked. We had to cover a lot of area just the two of us. You show the uniqueness of our instruments and what we can really do. All the time, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;the thing that’s really rewarding is just playing really beautiful melody.&lt;/span&gt; Of course you improvise, but it’s about phrasing. If it wasn’t about phrasing, it’d be like…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I’m running long a lot with these long sentences I’m saying, but it’s like a really good conversation or poetry. It’s not just, [sings a bunch of notes quickly]. Like a guy at an art auction just blazing… It took me a while to realize that the stuff that really works well is just letting the instrument be itself and phrase beautifully within any kind of situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, it’s not always about &lt;em&gt;Flight of the Fly&lt;/em&gt; or choppy kind of stuff, which is great. It’s fun to show off and often I do, but it’s also about just being a beautiful phrase. If it’s going to be a note competition, I’m not going to win compared to…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;When I was in the Flecktones, we’d play with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Thile&quot;&gt;Chris Thile &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And here we are jamming outside on a really hot day and he’s just… WHOA, man what am I gonna do here? “Trade eighths with this guy!” going 210 miles an hour. And so he’d shred and I’m trying to do &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; here. It got me thinking that I can do what I can, but it’s never going to be something that’s going to be as fast as or speedy as some other instruments because, just technically, you have all these thumb keys to play and the combinations are crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/aKlOJL37vbc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;So, there’s other things you can do. You don’t always have to play that way. There’s other ways to be awesome.&lt;/span&gt; I’ve always loved the singing quality of the instrument. Phrasing is singing. Even when I was younger, sometimes that stuff left behind a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Can you tell us a little about this instrument?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;P: Sure. I don’t have a reed to play it with. Basically, a lot of people don’t see it from this side, they see it from &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; side. Looks like some kind of wind instrument. You know, you’ve got your keys, but then you’ve got all these thumb keys you’re supposed to play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s crazy fingerings. On the sax, when you move one finger to press a pad, the same kind of fingerings, you’d have to use all your fingers. It’s an older system. It’s based on some recorder, I would say. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dulcian&quot;&gt;dulcian recorder &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It comes apart in different places. There’s one at the bell joint, there’s another joint here and one there. People can get through security, luckily. Some people, in the days right after 9/11, people were always stopping me because I had a really horrible looking passport picture that got corrupt and made me look like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah&quot;&gt;Hezbollah &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Hanson. And of course I had my microphones in the case, really sensitive pickup microphones… I’ll show you that in a second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But, basically this is where I screwed the pickup in right here. It goes there. And, “What the hell is that?” They’re looking at the reeds because they’re so weird. Some of the metal things in my preamps are unique. I had these preamps made by Gary Hull, who lives in Santa Cruz, did a lot of things for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Hedges&quot;&gt;Michael Hedges &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a system called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=2539&quot;&gt;FRAP &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; time ago. I’m not sure if they were related, but anyway I think he has his own company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But anyway, so there’s bizarre stuff going through airport security with this bassoon player. “No you don’t see many of that because not many people do that kind of stuff.” It all worked out. It never got confiscated. Sorry, I’m a little dry. So, anyway, it’s made out of Bosnian maple. Maple’s a very hard wood and they age the wood for about 12 years. 10 to 12 years. Then they carve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.b-moosmann.de/en/&quot;&gt;Moosmann &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is my bassoon maker. Moosmann is a great company from Germany. Herr Moosmann makes fantastic… They made this for me. A really beautiful instrument. So, this is called the bocal. The neck goes in there. And this is a gold-plated sterling silver and it makes a big deal. Everything in the reed. I play &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.legere.com&quot;&gt;Legere reeds &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which are synthetic reeds that are fantastic for me. Yeah, this is the bassoon and it’s a great, great sound. If you don’t pick it up right here [at the bocal]…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;A great, really fantastic invention was made by a guy named Trent Jacobs. For many years I played something called FRAP. I don’t know if you guys know about FRAP. Flat Response Audio Pickup. You see old videos of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Harris&quot;&gt;Eddie Harris &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Galway&quot;&gt;James Galway &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;… Um, who else used to play his stuff? There’s a few guitar players who still play his pickups. But, he had a really incredible wind instrument system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, when &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerson,_Lake_%26_Palmer&quot;&gt;Emerson, Lake, &amp;amp; Palmer &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; went on tour in the mid-70s, they contacted him to make all the brass and wind players’ pickups. So, they all had little pickup systems, little preamps. It’s a fantastic sounding orchestra. I heard it and it was just fantastic at the time. He’s really in the era of hi-fi where hi-fi is really celebrated. It’s not celebrated as much anymore because we’re in a totally different time in history. I saw this amazing band called &lt;a href=&quot;http://progarchives.com/artist.asp?id=2960&quot;&gt;Cartoon &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is the band… [to Bob] You’ve heard of these guys?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/AqoVuCclav0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;B: I have them on vinyl…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;P: Awesome. Oh my gosh. Herb Diamant was one of the guys I saw playing bassoon with this band. He said it was this pickup. This was when I was in school and &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; gave me a kick in the pants. Here’s a guy playing with a band like &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; and I really liked that band. They were a little bit different from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cow&quot;&gt;Henry Cow &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but that kind of influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, music school, these guys are there, these guys playing with this pickup on the bassoon… I’m sold, I’m in. So I got myself a pickup and played it for many years. I had to get myself another one in 1991 because it broke and I used that one in–I had two of them, I think. Those two have lasted me all the way until right about now. I don’t use them anymore because they’re very finnicky. You can’t get them fixed because they’re obsolete. There’s no need for them anymore. No one uses that kind of technology anymore. They do things different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But, &lt;a href=&quot;http://tjbassoon.com&quot;&gt;Trent Jacobs &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a great bassoon player from Minneapolis. He’s calling and somebody wrote a dissertation on me, I guess, or something for his college. He invented a little pickup system and has a little preamp. It’s called &lt;a href=&quot;http://tjbassoon.com/little-jake/&quot;&gt;The Little Jake &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and it works okay. It works pretty good. I wouldn’t say it’s quite as high quality as the FRAP was, but it’s different. What I’d do when I record is, obviously, use microphones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I’m recording tomorrow, actually. We’re recording the music today, actually. We’re doing a record. And so these microphones in a recording situation, nothing beats the sound of that. But, obviously, when you’re playing with drummers and stuff like that, you go electric. So, I figured a way to dial it in and now I used–right behind that case–there’s the Avalon U5 and I use that. I’m looking for something smaller than that actually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I want something that I can put on my pedalboard. And my pedalboard is right–I don’t have anything in it. Oh, I just have my looper in it. Somewhere around here is my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tc-helicon.com/en/products/voicelive-2/&quot;&gt;T.C. Electronic VoiceLive 2 &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I play everything through that. For what I do, I could go nuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;If I had a roadie, I have this big old rack in the garage with a huge case that cost $300. I can have things like an envelope filter–I have an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto-wah&quot;&gt;envelope filter &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; up there. I have all kinds of things. An envelope filter is pretty fantastic. You can go really nuts, you just have to have the place to do it. I don’t do it unless someone’s asking for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4WaGnpmgGhw&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But, for my basic electronics, I’m not sure–I’m answering questions that haven’t even been asked yet. I usually just use pretty straight sounds, maybe with a little delay or reverb and then I’ll double it. I have a doubler. Doubled bassoon sounds really good and the T.C.s are for voice, so it’s bass from voice, it’s similar to what you would do with a horn or bassoon or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Well, our site is called Make Weird Music. I would imagine you’ve considered your music to be “weird,” or other people have said…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;P: What’s weird is that I’m using a bassoon to do it. I never think of myself as–Who knows what they think? I’m not trying to be obscure. I really like to reach out to people, but it’s like, “You’re playing this weird instrument. How do you do that?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I just don’t know if I wanted to be different, but I wanted to take this instrument that’s really beautiful and lovely and do something different with it.&lt;/span&gt; I guess that’s it: be different and not try to make people sick or something like that. But, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;just do something unique and push the envelope a little bit.&lt;/span&gt; What &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; this instrument do? Why &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; it be part of a swinging jazz group or rockin’ out or funkin’ out or whatever? You know? I’ve been fortunate enough to have that opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: That’s actually exactly what I’m going for in terms of “weird.” Just do something a little different. You don’t have to make people hate the music. It can be totally “normal” that anybody could like, but there’s a &lt;em&gt;bassoon&lt;/em&gt; playing that. You don’t know that. The Eddie Money story!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;P: Well, you know the bassoon often–the thing that gets me–it always gets back to the melodies because sometimes when I’m playing, people don’t know if it’s a guitar, some weird synth, because I’ve played a lot of note-y music in the past or something like that. “Wow, what is that thing?” And then I realized, “That’s not really what I want. I want them to know what the hell that is!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Also as I get older, I realize–You know, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;you don’t want to get confused for something else.&lt;/span&gt; It’s nice to be chameleon, don’t get me wrong. It’s really nice to imitate different things and be a part of that. What you can do with the instrument is amazing, not only acoustically, but electronically. Then, actually getting back to what it’s really about is a really melodic phrasing approach where you’re singing from your soul and this instrument surely does that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It really surely does. That’s the first thing we all hear. If someone’s talking to you or singing, that’s the first thing you hear–in rhythm. But, when it gets into mixolydian flat gemonist 5 whatever chords, mixophrygolydian… I don’t know. That’s the kind of stuff that’s like, “Hmm…” There has to be purpose for it. You know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Wj0yVW9DlY&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: You’ve brought up bands from Emerson, Lake, &amp;amp; Palmer to Henry Cow to John Coltrane to Dirty Loops. Do you have a top set of influential bands or for eras you were really listen to a lot &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;P: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Brecker&quot;&gt;Mike Brecker &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, of course. Brecker was there of course. There was an era where those guys who came out of that jazz rock thing. Different eras that just really set my alarm off. I think the first guy that killed me was hearing &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hymn_of_the_Seventh_Galaxy&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hymn of the 7th Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_to_Forever&quot;&gt;Return to Forever &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in music camp. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Just hearing this incredible music that crossed over wide jazz-rock thing, a fusion thing. It got me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Just as a musician, for some reason, that just grabs you. They’re doing these incredible things. In some ways, it sounds like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Mahler&quot;&gt;Mahler &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, it sounds like funk. It’s just amazing! You know? What a great combination! Chocolate and peanut butter! It works great. That was fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And then &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Police&quot;&gt;The Police &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were a great group. It’s just all kinds of different things. Hendrix was huge. Coltrane was huge. Brecker was huge. The guys he played with. Some aspects of Return to Forever. I liked them a little bit before–&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Di_Meola&quot;&gt;Al Di Meola &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a really great player. I like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Connors&quot;&gt;Bill Connors &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; side. That record was really more of a balance for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But, then later on… There’s all sorts of different things. There was an era where &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chemical_Brothers&quot;&gt;The Chemical Brothers &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were really amazing and some of the stuff that happened during that time period. Boy–&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamiroquai&quot;&gt;Jamiroquai &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I played in a band that’s very much like Jamiroquai for a while. Nowadays, I don’t know if I ever have any top favorites, but there’s all kinds of different things and people I’m missing and completely forgetting about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;There’s of course, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McLaughlin_(musician)&quot;&gt;John McLaughlin &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;… We just did &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Inner_Mounting_Flame&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dance of Maya&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last night and I’ve always wanted to do that tune because that beginning guitar part is totally a bassoon part. &lt;em&gt;Totally&lt;/em&gt;. It’s very much like a cello, broken chords. That’s &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; idiomatic of this instrument particularly. Oh, it’s ridiculous. I played it with effects and it’s fantastic. So, that was a big influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uuy5XbhId90&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I’d say, lately–really there’s some fantastic–Dirty Loops is great to see someone that popular with that incredible amount of music. They’ve got a ton of energy. Young. Man, ridiculous. And, of course, Knower is fantastic. I’m trying to think of who else that I really listen to a lot right now that will get me going. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meshuggah&quot;&gt;Meshuggah &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is another one. I love Meshuggah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: You love Meshuggah?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;P: Oh yeah, definitely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So you really &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; like &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/panzerballett&quot;&gt;Panzerballett&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;P: Oh, hell yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Their &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brecker_Bros.&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some Skunk Funk&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is unbelievable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/BFoZoTwGfJk&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;P: I’ll check them out. I don’t know why I missed out on them for so long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I’ll play it for you after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;P: I gotta hear it. I can’t wait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: It’s stunning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;P: The thing is, the older you get, being in a place where people can have the time and the wherewithall to spend time together gelling to make something happen–because that’s the hardest thing to do when all your stuff’s all over the place. Sometimes time and location–our period was 1980s and 90s when I was in the Bay Area, there was a lot of world beat stuff going on and African music and African bands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I played a combination of different things that were happening. That was a time when things were percolating and rents were cheap, or at least for me at the time. I didn’t have as many things. It’s great to hear about these guys. When I say Meshuggah, I mean I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I personally would love to hear a melody on top of that stuff. Even if it was simple. He could scream it a little bit. I mean, nothing against them. They’re a fantastic band. That’s their style. It’s fantastic. I’ll put up with it. The next development to me would be melodic on top of those &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt; riffs. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomas_Haake&quot;&gt;Thomas Haake &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is incredible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;In fact, I wish I could get a recording–if I ever get a grant and get around to it–I did a music night called “Homecoming” for the Berkeley Jewish Music Festival because I played a lot of Jewish music in my life. Technically, I’m Jewish. I played in the Klezmorim and in Davka. It’s kind of a combination of a lot of interesting things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/5m9EkYW5O-Q&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But, taking some of the old Yiddish melodies and interesting modes–the modes are flat 2nd, major third, flat 2nd. Putting those amazing time signature stuff that’s basically all in 4–But, Meshuggah’s stuff all underneath it. We did something like that, but we didn’t get enough time to really gel on some of that stuff, but we did some of that on the concert for that little poster over there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Yeah, that would be great to do, if I have all these musical lifetimes to find a… Maybe Chever can help out with a few bucks and put it all together. We’ll see. I don’t know why they’d be interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Well, Bob… You’ve listened to Paul. You’ve seen him live for many years. Do you have any questions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;B: Something that was just in the back of my mind is it looks like a really finnicky instrument. I wonder if you’ve ever had problems showing up and it doesn’t work. Do you ever carry a backup?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;P: I had a backup for a while. I was playing so much in Japan that I had to have one, but I didn’t really ever have a problem. We have a great technician. My wife works at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forrestsmusic.com&quot;&gt;Forrests Music &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is a fantastic double reed store in Berkeley, California. An excellent repair person. I was just there the other day because this is starting to fall off. And real quick he got it done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/TrJReTv-DD8&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;No, I play my instruments hard, but I get them done every year. You just learn after a while not to drop it. You have this radar around you when you see an instrument like this. It sticks out everywhere. I remember playing a gig where the stage started to go up and down like this [dramatically waving up and down]. “Oh my God! Look out!” I stood there on the stage like this [holding the top of the bassoon]. I was playing another instrument and just thought, “Oh my God, I have to put this down.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Look at it. You have a wire coming out of it, there was something added on here when I was with the Flecktones. I had a different pickup system. It’s very rare, so I had this thing put on because I had to have a cable go up here and get it anchored there because when you step on your cable, it comes right out of the pickup, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, that’s why I have this thing here. Now, I don’t need it because it’s a shorter cable and I can put it in my pocket. It’s really hard to get something in the way of it. So, that’s the biggest element because you’re playing bassoon and then you’re stepping on a cable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;B: It’s not the bassoon, it’s the electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;P: Yeah, just that. The bassoon–you just have to be careful. You just have to have your radar up about things that are around your instrument. Once when I was in Japan, some kid came at my bassoon and I just grabbed it. I saw it out of the corner of my eye. It could happen. Anything could happen. I’m just very careful with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Like kids with the cup of milk on the table. You just learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;P: Yeah, you just learn. I think you had some other questions about some other things, right? Like what people called this instrument?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;B: Well, it does look like could be used to smoke things. I would guess the joke has been told to you constantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;P: All the time because I played with the Flecktones and they had a lot of tapers, they had a lot of people where you could just smell the marijuana up front. People grooving out. It’s interesting because the music is kind of complex, right? But, yet people are jamming and having a great time and doing the “stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;We played a lot of festivals. A lot of those jam bands were playing and a lot of that stuff goes on. I’d get, “Oh man… Dude… That’s the–baddest bong I ever saw.” But the best thing that ever happened, the most hilarious one–people never know what it’s called, right? “What is that thing?” So this guy comes up and he’s fried and he had his shirt off… “Maaannnn, is that–is that–is that–is that and ooba?” Is that an uzi? An uba? I don’t know. So funny. An ooba! I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s funny. You learn a real sophisticated classical instrument that everyone knows in the classical world and you’re in an environment and you’re trying to get somewhere and you get, “Listen to &lt;em&gt;THAT&lt;/em&gt;.” You know? So, it’s funny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: You mentioned another instrument you play called the EWI?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;P: Yeah, I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: What is that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;P: Electric wind instrument. You never heard of it??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Bob, have you heard of it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;B: Yeah, Brecker played it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;P: Oh yeah. It’s definitely a period instrument. I have something like that up there called a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_WX5&quot;&gt;WX-5 from Yamaha &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s behind the cups up there. The EWI is just static. If you touch this little pad, it means you bent the note, but it’s so touch-sensitive I don’t even like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;B: Kind of like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SynthAxe&quot;&gt;SynthAxe &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in a way? It’s not a real instrument, but it plays like one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/6GtbBmNEEWg&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;P: I did a lot of it. I did some in Japan. I also played it in Cirque for certain flute parts or trumpet mutes or little things that I’d do. Cues and stuff like that. I played it a lot in my first Cirque show I was in, Saltimbanco. I played that going back and forth between five million different things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Anything else, Bob?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;B: What are you looking forward to for the future?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;P: Well, I have the commission to finish. It’s something that I hope to release on my own. I think the name, the working title so far is &lt;em&gt;Warlords of Irony&lt;/em&gt; is the name of the piece. It’s pretty heavy duty little thing. I’d like to get it mixed right and I’m not sure that the client–it’s a good friend of mine–I’m not sure what he wants it in, but they have to perform it first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So when they perform it first, then I get a chance to release it on my own. I’ll do that. It’s a cool piece of music. Other bassoonists can play it and go along with it. I’ll probably improvise over it, but it can have sections. Either a solo will be written out or they’ll just have to go out on their own or have something written for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And then these couple bands I’ve been playing with. One is just a CD release thing coming up next month in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Jazz_Conservatory&quot;&gt;California Jazz Conservatory &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I think it’s the last day of January. And the group I’m recording with tomorrow, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jeffdenson.com&quot;&gt;Jeff Denson &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;’s group, probably going to Europe next year. And then Oon, we might also be in Europe next year also. So there’s things going on there. And then, teaching. I’ll do some master classes. Different kind of things like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;B: It wasn’t like a professional concern, but just pure music… What would you be looking forward to? Like a situation, is there a band? What would inspire you without any outside considerations?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;P: I get a lot on my plate in terms of the jazz situation. But something that’s more like, I don’t know, something that cross a little more to people, I suppose, some of the time. It depends on if it’s just the purity of music, it’s not about commerce, it would probably be something that I could see people dancing to. Certain people come and groove a little bit, not just staring and going like this [crosses arms and looks skeptical], looking at your chops and that sort of thing. And it’s hard to say. I’m doing a lot of great music right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I’m enjoying a lot of the music I’m doing. It’d be great to be able to put the things across that I’ve worked on, like they have the funding and the wherewithall to put across the project I worked on commission by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jewishmusicfestival.org&quot;&gt;Berkeley Jewish Music Festival &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to write this piece. I’ve got a ton of music, I’d like to have that pulled off and be able to see a tour of that, for example. That’d be fantastic. But, that means I’d have to have the resources to be able to do it right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s hard to get everything done and really have people have time to learn their parts and really gel. Anything that was a long-running thing that had a chance to go for a while because I think you really get a benefit out of playing music more than once or twice. Something you could tour with. That’s kind of a thing. That sounds kind of funny, but seriously, that’s what I’m always looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;If I was part of a band where I played Dirty Loops kind of stuff, or Knower. That’d be cool. You know, where it’s not necessarily about a jazz solo all the time. That’s just fine. It’s something that gives people a chance to work together for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I think that’s a benefit for musicians is not just have one shot and that’s it. It’s different now than it was when you could play with the same musicians, you know, three or four nights in a row. Some people get to do that, but often, people are not incredibly well established. It’s hard to do that, so something that is ongoing a little bit more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I don’t know. That’s kind of a weird question because musically, what are you looking for? I like all kinds of different things, but it’s just that the chance for the music to really develop is what I think I’m looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/kOEF7f2HGoE&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;B: Some kind of fairly long-term thing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;P: Yeah. Definitely. That’s kind of a funny answer, but I just know a lot of people or I hear about it on Facebook where they’ve got a gig and they hype it up and it &lt;em&gt;happens&lt;/em&gt; and it’s gone. You want to do more. You want to be on tour. You want to find a way to bridge boundaries so that people really get what it’s about. When I played with the Flecktones, it wasn’t real last-minute. They’re playing really complex music. Somehow, they found a way to really get people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;B: Interesting because the Flecktones started as kind of a one-off for the PBS show and here they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;P: I know. It’s incredible. It’s amazing. I know Bela does more now on his own sometimes, or with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chick_Corea&quot;&gt;Chick Corea &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or something like that. They totally deserve everything. They’re so damn good. Man, incredible. All those guys were ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;B: I’ve always enjoyed seeing the wrong instruments play the right music, which Bela on the banjo and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.patcloud.com&quot;&gt;Pat Cloud &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; before him on the banjo. I don’t know if you know that name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;P: Pat Cloud?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;B: Yeah. Same kind of thing with the bassoon. It just sounds a little more fresh and unique. You know, you just kind of mess it up a little. It’s like fusion when you mix some eastern music with western funk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;P: Yeah, the thing is to find a way to be musically enticing and at the same time, something that doesn’t just become an academic exercise and looking in too much. You want to look out because you are playing for people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I love playing for people. I love seeing people really enjoying themselves. Of course, that being said, I’m not going to play a bunch of music that was really pandering or something…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;B: No &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Eyed_Girl&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brown Eyed Girl&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;P: Probably not at this point. I have nothing against certain covers, but it has to be done well. It’s just the musical treatment. I’m not going to do something like rap covers, do a Drake tune or something like that. I just don’t know enough about that genre to do something well. It has to be something that…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Some of the music I hear today, I’m not really up on all the pop music right now. Some of the stuff is very basic, simply. No lyrics and no melody. It’s like, “Well… nay nay na-na-na-nay nay.” I don’t know. It just sounds very–a 4-year-old could come up with it. I’m not going to do &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s just this kind of thing that’s like… I admire people who have a long-standing relationship with their audience and they’re able to–I would say someone even like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_(band)&quot;&gt;Rush &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is incredible because, my God, they almost didn’t make it. They were very close to stopping when they did–what was that record? &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caress_of_Steel&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caress the Steel&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;?   Something like that. Then &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2112_(album)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;2112&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; came out and it was exactly the opposite of what the record company said was going to happen. “Hit singles!” and stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;They did the exact opposite. They said, “We’re gonna go out the way we feel.” And they stuck to their guns and they knew somewhere that people relate to that, and they did. That was great. And that’s one of my top groups, also, was that group in particular. As a bassoon player, I’m trying to figure out how I fit into that. You know? Sorry I’m going on and on…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: No, it’s okay! I think we have to wrap up timewise. But, thank you &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much for your time. This has been awesome. Thanks for welcoming us into your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;P: Thanks a lot. I really appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Michael Manring Interview</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-context&quot;&gt;Some Context&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a 1-hour interview with Michael Manring conducted on Monday, December 7, 2015 at 11AM at Michael’s house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Manring&quot;&gt;Don’t know who Michael Manring is? Check out his entry at Wikipedia! &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been listening to Michael’s music since the late 1990s. He is an unbelievable musician and incredibly creative. I never thought I would see him perform live, but I had the opportunity at NAMM 2013 to see and barely hear him amidst the chaotic din of  “shredders.” Two years later, I’m sitting on his couch in his living room having a conversation. What an experience!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interview-audio-podcast&quot;&gt;Interview Audio (Podcast)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s audio of the interview (NOTE: hitting the “play” button requires a hefty download of the entire audio file!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;audio src=&quot;http://audio.makeweirdmusic.com/interview/michael-manring/michael-manring-interview-mwm-20151207.mp3&quot; controls=&quot;&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interview-video&quot;&gt;Interview video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a video of the interview:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/2naRtBfRFMo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were some issues with the audio that were my fault entirely. Sigh. Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://damprabbit.com&quot;&gt;Bob Mendelsohn &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for his help filming this!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interview-transcript&quot;&gt;Interview transcript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;Anthony: Hi, this is Anthony from MakeWeirdMusic.com and today we are here with Michael Manring. Michael, part of the purpose of the site is to introduce musicians and music enthusiasts to new kinds of music and new musicians. I thought it would be cool if you could just introduce yourself. Tell us a little about your musical history and what got you to where you are today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Michael: First of all, thank you so much for doing this, for helping those of us who make weird music, to get it out there and connect with the folks who are interested in this kind of stuff because it’s not for everybody. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;It can be a challenge for people to cut through all the other information that’s out there.&lt;/span&gt; People who have really big budgets to spend to get to promote what they do, so we really appreciate homegrown support for guys like us. I know you’ve talked with a lot of my friends. We’re kind of a team in that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But, yeah, my name is Michael Manring and I fell in love with the bass guitar when I was ten years old and it just got a hold of me. There’s something about it that just really spoke to me and has never let go. I wanted to be a rock star when I was a kid. I thought that would be really fun just because that’s all I knew you did with a bass guitar. But as I got older and learned a little bit about the music business, I really didn’t think I fit into professional musician-kind-of-personality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zaK2GU9pgos?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I kind of wanted to be a music teacher and I kind of headed in that direction, but I just kept getting gigs and doing a lot of stuff. I got really interested in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_therapy&quot;&gt;music therapy &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and I really pursued the idea of being a music therapist for a while and everybody just said to me, “Oh no, don’t do that. You’re better off being a player. There’s no money in it and it’s an untested field and you work really hard and you don’t know what’s gonna happen. It’s really very, very sketchy, so you’re better off being a player.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Actually, as it turned out, music therapy is a really blossoming field and there aren’t enough people and it generally pays pretty well. So, it was just one of the many career turns that I probably should have been more intelligent about. But, things have worked out okay. I just love music, I love playing music and I love playing for people. So, it’s actually been okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rock-star-and-woodstock&quot;&gt;Rock Star and Woodstock&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Tell me about that transition. Who did you listen to that made you think, “I wanna play the bass. I wanna be a rock star.” And then, were there musical influences or was it organic development of who you were and learning more about the industry that made you shy away from that rock star element?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: The first thing that we all kind of got into, all the kids in my neighborhood got into was the record &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodstock&quot;&gt;Woodstock &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We were all a little young for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles&quot;&gt;Beatles &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; phenomenon. We knew about the Beatles, but it just didn’t connect. At that point, we were kind of more into younger kid things. But Woodstock really kind of grabbed us all. We were all fascinated by it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;One of the things about that was there’s a lot of different kinds of music at Woodstock. You know, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimi_Hendrix&quot;&gt;Jimi Hendrix &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was there, but also &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Shankar&quot;&gt;Ravi Shankar &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sha_Na_Na&quot;&gt;Sha Na Na &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richie_Havens&quot;&gt;Richie Havens &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. All kinds of stuff. For me, at least, and I think for some of my friends, too, that was part of the appeal. This whole world of different things going on and there was kind of a lot to learn. “Where is this coming from? What is this doing? How do these people get to what they’re doing?” That was a real fascination. So, the first thing I was into was just kind of everything. Just getting into listening to all of it, trying to figure out what it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/3fZBaPS_XvQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;For me, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;the bass was the common thread through it all. I just loved the sound.&lt;/span&gt; At first I didn’t know what the sound was, actually. As a younger kid, I always loved the sound of the bass, but there wasn’t a lot of information about music in those days, so you’d hear something, you’d hear a sound, and as part of an ensemble, you don’t even know what’s making what. There wasn’t a lot of music video in those days, either. So, it took me a while to figure out that it was bass, but by the time Woodstock came out, that kind of information was much more available and you knew who the players were, what they were playing, and so that’s what really got me into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Really, anything with a bass on it was something that was fascinating to me, and even stuff without bass, except bass was the thing that always tied it together. Hendrix was big early on, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Who&quot;&gt;The Who &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and also &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steppenwolf_(band)&quot;&gt;Steppenwolf &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Funk_Railroad&quot;&gt;Grand Funk Railroad &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sly_and_the_Family_Stone&quot;&gt;Sly and the Family Stone &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was really huge inspiration to me. That was one of the many times in those days that I heard a song and just &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt; it and finally someone said to me, “You know, that part right there–that’s the bass playing that part.” And I just thought, “Oh my God! That’s the bass? That is so cool!” So, those guys were kind of the original inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-music-industry&quot;&gt;The Music Industry&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But, I got pretty quickly into jazz as well. Got fascinated by all that. Then got into classical music and contemporary music and avant garde music and different folk musics and just kind of soaked it all up. I just wanted to be part of that. As I got older, when I got to be 17, 18, I started seeing how the music industry works and that it’s… Oh, how can one say politely? &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;It’s good in the music business if you’re not an introvert.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Let’s say that. If you’re an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion&quot;&gt;extravert &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, that’s really a good quality. And I kind of struggle with that. I’m really, really happy just sitting in my room playing music, always have been. But, getting out there and marketing myself is not a skill I have and, in fact, it’s hard for me to even think that way. So, that made me think that, “Maybe that’s not the best career choice for me because that’s always going to be a struggle.” I met a lot of people who were just really good at that and a lot of them just naturally so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s really impressive when you meet somebody like that. There’s a tendency to look down on that skill, I think–the skill of being able to market yourself. But I know quite a number of people for whom it’s just a natural ability and it’s not forced and I’ll always admire those people. But, that’s not a skill I ever had!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yeah, that’s a very tough one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: It is. But, it’s nice when you meet people who are good at it, especially when they’re great musicians as well and they just kind of honestly are able to share with you the excitement about their own music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;on-the-road&quot;&gt;On the Road&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: And when did you start becoming a professional bass player?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: I started doing professional gigs in high school, actually. In fact, I was asked to join a professional big band–you know, like a jazz band–in high school with guys… I would have been the youngest person in the band. I did a lot of gigs with those guys and they wanted me to join, but I had to say no because we would go out and do a gig in the general area, but it might be a gig three hours away, so I’d get home at 2 in the morning and then have to get up at 7 to go to school. And that was a little rough and I didn’t want to quit school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I did pretty well in school, actually, and I wanted to–at least for high school–I wanted to finish. So, I started playing professionally at a pretty young age and just kind of kept going. After high school, I went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berklee_College_of_Music&quot;&gt;Berklee School of Music &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I stayed there for an academic year, but I got a gig. I was doing a lot of gigs there as well and I got a gig on the road at the end of my academic year at Berklee and went on the road playing music. And I’ve been playing music ever since, professionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Who was the first touring gig with?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: I guess the first touring gig was probably that big band, actually, where we weren’t really touring. It was kind of local, but we would go out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I see. So you were playing regularly with that big band after your first year, which led to other opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;disco&quot;&gt;Disco&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Yeah, I did that kind of while I was in high school, but kind of had to back out of it just because I couldn’t finish high school and do that at the same time. It was too much. Right out of Berklee, I went on the road playing top 40 music, which in those days was disco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/nvIydHPhb98?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;In those days, we wore the platform shoes and shiny, shiny shirts with collars that went out to here. Aerodynamic. And we played &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boogie_Oogie_Oogie&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boogie Oogie Oogie&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disco_Inferno&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disco Inferno&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and that band was a road band. We all lived in different cities and so there was no home to go to. So we were on the road always. Usually play out a week or two weeks in one place. Most typically hotels, you know a hotel ballroom or there were little hotel disco clubs. And then we would travel on a Sunday to the next place and then play there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I lasted about 6 or 8 months just touring out on the road. It got pretty tedious pretty fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Musically? Or contextually with business related things?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: The worst part about it, for me, was since we were playing–we played, like, 5 sets a night or something. I really couldn’t practice very much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: 5 sets a night?! Oh my goodness!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Yeah, it was a lot of playing. I would practice for a couple hours in the day, but I was kind of burnt out from playing. I wasn’t really making much musical progress. And for me, that was the hardest part of it. I did have to come to terms with the fact that I really wasn’t that interested in the music. I mean, I loved playing, and it’s always fun to play any kind of music, but when you’re playing the same tunes night after night, every night…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: With no improvisational opportunities…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Well, this was kind of a nice band because we were all Berklee people. Everybody in the band could play and everybody could play jazz. And when they let us get away with it, we would! But, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;we got fired from a couple of gigs for that very thing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: 3 sets in?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Yeah! And being on the road, that was not pretty, because you were completely dependent on whoever hired you for your meals. So, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;if you got fired, you didn’t eat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;getting-into-jazz&quot;&gt;Getting into Jazz&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Tell me about your musical progress, then. You’re evolving as a musician, you’re listening to jazz, you listened to a lot of genres, you go to Berklee for a year, and then you’re playing with a disco band. So, obviously, you have to change some priorities. What did that look like and what did you do after you left that band?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: My education in music was mostly jazz. So, that’s kind of how I learned about music. Even though I was playing upright a lot in those days, too, I had to give up upright after going on the road with the disco band because I couldn’t take an upright for that gig and obviously that was not welcome there. So, unfortunately, my classical career was pretty brief, which is probably for the best because I never got really good at the upright. I guess I was really interested in playing classical music on the upright with the bow, but it’s a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; commitment and I didn’t seem to be making the kind of progress I wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But, yeah, so the background in jazz was really helpful. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;There’s two ways to think about jazz. You can think about it as an idiom&lt;/span&gt;, which means you’re thinking about the kind of phrases that are used in jazz and the kind of rhythms that are used in jazz. But, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;jazz can also be looked at academically&lt;/span&gt;. So, in order to be able to play jazz, you have to understand music in a remarkably comprehensive way. Looked at in that way, it’s just a great musical education because, if you’re looking at it that way rather than as an idiom, you can understand and play jazz, in that sense, you can almost play any kind of music because you have this kind of nuts and bolts understanding of how things work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;You can apply that to any kind of form that you find yourself in. So, then it’s a matter of just trying to adapt to the other idioms. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Adapting to other idioms can be very, very challenging&lt;/span&gt;, so that can be a big part of it. But at least you can understand the fundamentals of music. You know, what notes can be played and how you can play them, that kind of stuff. So, that was really helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fusion-band&quot;&gt;Fusion Band&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;The education I got at Berklee was really helpful in that way and it allowed me to kind of pursue this kind of dream of trying lots of different things. So, after Berklee and then after I left the disco band, pretty quickly I joined an original fusion band in Washington D.C. That was great. That was a lot of fun. In those days, we played about three gigs a week playing original fusion music, which was amazing! I don’t think you could do that now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Paid gigs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Paid gigs! I mean, we weren’t making much money. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;We were kind of all living in our parents’ basements.&lt;/span&gt; But, you know, we were getting by and you could afford to get a car and, you know, do okay. And we got signed to Tappan Zee Records, which was–I think it was a CBS offshoot in those days. It was run by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Chattaway&quot;&gt;Jay Chattaway &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_James_(musician)&quot;&gt;Bob James &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;We worked on a record and we got a local studio, a really good studio in the area, was backing us. They gave us all their “off” studio time. That tended to be between, say, 8PM and 10AM. And so we would often have run of the play all night long. That was great. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I started to learn how to work in the studio and that was definitely eye-opening and a good experience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;We spent ridiculous amounts of time working on our record and, as is often the case, that only made it sound worse. But it was a great learning experience. The record company, Tappan Zee, folded just before we finished the recorded. So we did all that recording, not for nought certainly, but the record never came out officially. We at least recorded cassettes and sold them to our friends and gave a lot of them away. That was fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, then after that band, when the record company folded and things were changing and it was harder to get gigs, we saw the writing on the wall that being an original fusion band didn’t have as much a future as we’d all hoped. So we disbanded and I moved to New York to be a starving artist there instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;to-new-york&quot;&gt;To New York&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: But, it was a lot cheaper then to be in New York…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: In New York, it was cheaper then, but I think it was still the most expensive place in the country, so it was still a challenge. The thing about New York then is it was really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; rough and where I lived was &lt;em&gt;really, really&lt;/em&gt; rough. I got beat up…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: What years were this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: I moved there maybe in ‘82 or ‘83. Around in that time. So, it was a hard place to be, but it was amazing. I mean, New York–it still is amazing, but in those days, everybody basically on the east coast who was creative kind of ended up in New York. That’s kind of the way it worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yeah, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kitchen&quot;&gt;The Kitchen &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Yeah, the Kitchen was just getting started…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Byrne&quot;&gt;David Byrne &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/the-residents&quot;&gt;The Residents&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie_Anderson&quot;&gt;Laurie Anderson &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;… Amazing acts played there all the time for cheap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/B9ZOjpsXxPY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Yep! That’s right!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: You were there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: I was there. Yep! I couldn’t afford to go to a lot of the cool stuff that was going on. But I was around a lot of it. And there was an amazing art scene as well. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Haring&quot;&gt;Keith Haring &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. [NOTE: See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artsy.net/artist/keith-haring&quot;&gt;Keith Haring artwork here on Artsy &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.] You’d see Keith Haring paintings that would just appear overnight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banksy&quot;&gt;Banksy &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of that time, I suppose?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Yeah. I was involved in a lot of dance. The dance world. One way of making a very small amount of money as a musician is to accompany modern dance classes. Some people know about that. I used to love doing that and working with dancers and writing music for choreographers. The dancing was amazing then. It was great to be in such a creative place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;jaco-pastorius&quot;&gt;Jaco Pastorius&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaco_Pastorius&quot;&gt;Jaco Pastorius &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was there then, too, and he was my idol at that point.&lt;/span&gt; It was just absolute borderline worship, I guess. And that was neat because I could see him play often. I would bug him whenever I felt like I could get away with it, bug him with lots of questions, and he finally said, “Well, just come for lessons.” And so I took some lessons with him as well. So that was kind of a good experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Kind of?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Yeah. [Laughs.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Do you want to explore that a little bit?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Sure. It was kind of complicated for a bit because it was an incredible opportunity to get to spend time with him and see him play often and sit down and play music with him because he was such an idol and such a hero to me. But, it was difficult also because he was such a mess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;It was really hard to be around him because he was in so much personal turmoil.&lt;/span&gt; And he was very ill. That’s probably the cause of all his very, very bizarre behavior. He was extremely self-destructive. Not sure I’ve ever met anybody who was quite that self-destructive. It’s amazing that he lived as long as he did because he was the kind of person who would do something really stupid for no reason. Jump down a flight of stairs, hit himself in the head with a beer bottle. Just… “Okay?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;That was hard for me that there was this person who I so, so wanted to be, but he didn’t want to be himself. He didn’t want to be. That was a really complicated conundrum for a 22-year old person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/JXOnhzoC-i8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: How long were you taking lessons from him?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: It was very intermittent, off-and-on for a couple of years while I was there. Maybe 2 years. He was, sort of by choice, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;he was often homeless&lt;/span&gt;. It was very hard to get in touch with him, even when he &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; an address or a phone number. So, you never knew what was going to happen. He would say, “Hey, show up at this place tomorrow and we’ll do a lesson.” And he wouldn’t show up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So it was very sort of sketchy and I would just meet him at a gig and he’d say, “Here, let me show you this.” He’d show me some random thing! I still feel just so bad for him because he had a terrible reputation, especially in New York. An &lt;em&gt;awful&lt;/em&gt; reputation. And, you know, I guess it was deserved. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I went to a lot of gigs where he wouldn’t show up and gigs where he would walk off the stage and gigs where he would try to get in a fight with one of the other band members or the bartender or &lt;em&gt;somebody&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;You can understand why people didn’t think highly of him. I saw him be very, very mean and rude to a lot of people, but he was very, very kind to me. Really kind to me. We had wonderful conversations. Underneath all that, he was a really smart guy. He knew everything about music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;We would sit and talk about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Béla_Bartók&quot;&gt;Bartok &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frédéric_Chopin&quot;&gt;Chopin &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Stravinsky&quot;&gt;Stravinsky &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He was very supportive to me, often, especially when it was just the two of us. He liked to just sit and play together a lot and we’d play jazz standards usually. When we were done, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;he’d slap me on the back and go, “Oh man, you’re the best on earth!”&lt;/span&gt; Which was not true. Definitely not true. Especially compared to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But, I think he knew I was a nervous kid who was uncertain and he was just trying to be nice. He thought, maybe I guess, I had some potential. I would pester him with millions of questions and he was always very patient about doing his best to answer them. He had trouble concentrating a lot, so you just had  to keep–“Come on back!”–reeling him back in. There was a lot of that. But, he was never really rude about that, at least not with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/TgntkGc5iBo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I asked him a lot about specific parts, “When you played this line,” or, “How did you phrase that?” or “How did you finger it?” He’d generally get really spacey for a minute and I’d bring him back and he’d go, “Oh, right. This is how I did it.” There was a whole lot of stuff he didn’t remember or didn’t think about. There were a lot of things I asked about and he said, “You know, I never thought about that.” Or I’d ask him to play something for me and I’d say, “It seems like you’re doing &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;. Is that right?” He’d say, “Yeah, I guess that’s right.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Oddly, he really wanted to teach. He had this dream of having a bass school.&lt;/span&gt; One of his pet peeves was that if you’re a bass player, there was no Chopin and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domenico_Scarlatti&quot;&gt;Scarlatti &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven&quot;&gt;Beethoven &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sonatas to work on and to allow you to advance your craft. He wanted to start that process, but he was, as I said, he had so much trouble focusing that that was just never going to happen. So, it was interesting, especially being in New York at that time when it was just so dark and so dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I lived on Long Island as a kid and I remember going to the city. It was, “Don’t look up because people will know you’re a tourist and you’ll get mugged!” I was terrified of New York City as a kid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Yeah, I had a lot of bad things happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;michael-hedges&quot;&gt;Michael Hedges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So, not long after that, you started getting involved with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Hedges&quot;&gt;Michael Hedges &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windham_Hill_Records&quot;&gt;Windham Hill &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. How did that happen and can you tell us some of those experiences?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Yeah, that was really great. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;The music in New York in those days reflected the sort of darkness of the social scene.&lt;/span&gt; The kind of music we were doing, I was playing a lot of dark, heavy, complicated music. There were just amazing musicians there then, as there are now, as there always have been. And it’s how I got to play with some people who were just really, really high-level musicians. But, the whole thing just felt so heavy and in those days, I was getting really interested in bass as a solo instrument and the possibilities for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I had discussions with Jaco about that as well. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;When I talked to people in New York about that, I got a lot of very blank stares.&lt;/span&gt; I think one of the things about New York in those days is there was a lot of artistry, but you kind of had to fit in to one of the available boxes. So, you kind of had to be a jazz musician or a fusion musician or an avant garde musician. Those were three places that I liked a lot. I was kind of interested in all those things and some other things as well. I liked all those worlds, but there wasn’t a lot of crossing between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;The lines were pretty clearly defined and I was never really comfortable with that.&lt;/span&gt; As soon as there was a line drawn in the sand, the first thing I wanted to do was cross over it or erase it entirely. That didn’t go over so well in New York and the idea of wanting to be a solo bassist was kind of like that, too. “Well, nobody’s ever done it so it’s not something that can be done,” which is not the way I think. “Well, nobody’s ever done it, so maybe it’s a good idea.” That’s sort of how I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And I had already started working with Michael Hedges when I lived in New York. I had known him for a couple of years even. I met him before I moved there, I think, or maybe about the time I moved there. When I met Hedges, he was not the Michael Hedges that we all came to know. He wrote his own music, but it was mostly pop music. I don’t know if he–when I had met him, he had maybe written one or two guitar instrumental pieces. That was about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/7aom6WcJRnI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But, he looked like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Young&quot;&gt;Neil Young &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and he loved Neil Young, and he sounded like Neil Young, and &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;he made a meager living playing Neil Young songs in bars every night&lt;/span&gt;, but he was studying contemporary and electronic music composition at Peabody Conservatory. So, he had this really super-high-level musical mind, but loved playing pop music and so we hit it off, you know, immediately. We definitely saw eye-to-eye. He was definitely a person who did not want to fit into one box or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hedges-and-guitar&quot;&gt;Hedges and Guitar&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So we became fast friends, but we were both starving musicians at that point. We both hadn’t developed much of an independent, recognizable sound. It’s funny, in those days, there was kind of a circle of our friends. We were all music-heads. Michael was, by no means, considered the best guitar player in our circle. In fact, he was kind of down low on the rungs. That group, everybody looked up to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Martino&quot;&gt;Pat Martino &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; more than anybody else, and with good reason. He’s just an amazing, amazing player. So, all the guitar players, and some of us bass players too, wanted to be able to play like Pat Martino.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Michael couldn’t really do that. It’s weird. He had all the understanding to do that, all the brain power to do that and more, but somehow it didn’t connect with him. I don’t know, it was kind of odd, especially since he ended up studying with Pat Martino.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/6KvOkNdZMsU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Right about the time he died, he started being able to play like Pat. He started being able to play that way, kind of with his own style. He was really interested, when he died, he was trying to go in some new directions. He was playing a lot more electric guitar and playing sort of his own version of that way was really neat. It’s a shame that he didn’t get to see that through because it could have been really cool, what he was coming up with in that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But in those days, that kind of style wasn’t connecting with him, but he had all this amazing musical talent and skill and understanding and so, instead, he kind of went this other direction. Instead of working toward playing these sophisticated lines, very interesting harmonically, he kind of did the opposite. He played very orchestrally, slower music and simpler harmonically. He tended to play music that was relatively simple harmonically, or maybe just more open harmonically. Less chromatic, maybe you could say. And developed that into this amazing artform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;What a privilege to get to spend time with him and watch him going from being a real copycat to being a real original, watch him go through that process and kind of go through it with him because that whole period, we would have these long talks about music and life and stupid things as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;development-as-a-bassist&quot;&gt;Development as a Bassist&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yeah, so what about &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; development? You went from disco band to fusion, which isn’t nearly as quiet as what you did with [Michael] and what you’ve done as a solo bassist. It’s kind of funny for me knowing a lot of your solo music outside outside of &lt;em&gt;Thonk&lt;/em&gt; to hear you talking about being in these kind of rock sort-of instrumentation bands. Yet your solo music is so quiet and what you’ve done with Michael Hedges, that was so quiet. How did you end up taking your technique, which I tell everyone is “extraterrestrial…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Thank you…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I like that you find that a compliment. It’s exactly what I mean. But, can you talk about your evolution? He’s coming from a Neil Young context, you’re coming from fusion and disco and he’s probably had his rock stuff, and then you guys become the faces for New Age music and a new, very soft sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Yeah, it was wonderful. It was especially wonderful to have a compadre in that process. We actually came from sort of similar backgrounds, although you’re right–mine was a little more sort of Sly and the Family Stone, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Led_Zeppelin&quot;&gt;Led Zeppelin &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Shorter&quot;&gt;Wayne Shorter &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where his was a little bit more Neil Young and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joni_Mitchell&quot;&gt;Joni Mitchell &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jethro_Tull_(band)&quot;&gt;Jethro Tull &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He was a big Jethro Tull head. But, you know, I was a fan of all those people as well. It’s just more that’s what we fell into, I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;We both had come from rock music backgrounds. Rock music was sort of the gateway drug, I think, for a lot of us into music. In fact, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;we both were &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; fans of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Halen&quot;&gt;Van Halen &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when we met&lt;/span&gt;. That was one of the things that we really–I think within the first two minutes of our first conversation, we talked about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Webern&quot;&gt;Anton Webern &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Van_Halen&quot;&gt;Eddie Van Halen &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Joni Mitchell, I think, and realized: “Okay, we’re gonna have to hang.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, yeah, it was a fascination with all these things and kind of youthful stupidity and enthusiasm where we’re just really into all of it and probably didn’t have as much common sense about wading through the good and bad as we should have, actually, but at that age, it’s probably a good thing. We were just thrilled by all of it and we both really wanted–we dreamed, I guess I should say–about creating our own approach. That was the dream. It doesn’t seem to be as much the case in music now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-holy-grail&quot;&gt;The Holy Grail&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I don’t know if you find that true, but, for a lot of us in those days, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;that was the holy grail: if you could come up with your own approach&lt;/span&gt;. It didn’t really even matter if that approach was especially sophisticated. Just having your own sound… that was the highest level. Just copying somebody else was something you did out of necessity, but it was a bad thing to do in the long term. That was really only a stepping stone toward coming up with a sound of your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, that was our dream: somehow taking all this music and distilling it down to something original. We wanted to reflect all of these musicians we loved. We wanted to carry that sound forward somehow at the same time. And we’re foolish enough to maybe think we could do that somehow. So, you were asking…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Finding your own sound–that was the holy grail. And you guys pursued that and found it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Yeah. He certainly did and it was amazing to watch. Especially amazing to watch this person who had a lot of potential as a musician, but was not somebody that anybody paid much attention to, honestly. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Even at the conservatory, he was not a star student.&lt;/span&gt; Neither there nor in the social circle of us “cats.” But he was able to really–It was a fascinating process of acknowledging your own strengths and weaknesses and looking at the things you love and distilling it all down and thinking about it a lot and having a lot of experiences and trying a lot of different things and feeling things out a lot and creating something beautiful out of all that. It’s really a beautiful thing to watch happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;more-jaco-and-finding-yourself-in-the-mistakes&quot;&gt;More Jaco and Finding Yourself in the Mistakes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I had read something you said quite some time ago that you were trying to emulate Jaco’s sound and you kept doing things that were “mistakes,” but then you found that those “mistakes” were &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;. They weren’t really mistakes, they were your own style coming through. Can you talk about that and when you discovered it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Absolutely. That was a really interesting experience. Really, my whole life there was this notion that the holy grail was really to develop your own thing. But as I got more into Jaco and started to understand his music more and his approach more, I was just so blown away by it that I thought, “Nobody’s ever going to do any better than this. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;The best you can be able to do is just emulate him and try to do it in a good and respectable way.&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, that was my point of view when I went in to study with him. That was all there was to the bass. It was to just play in that style and try to do it well. Maybe there were other things you could do, but you, at the very least, had to be able to understand this very deep and rich world that he had created before you could move on. So I just worked really hard at copying him and what he did and, as you said, I would play through his pieces often with his help and with his pointers and there were just certain things I just couldn’t get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/wDQlSSOXU6A?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;He was never critical about it. He didn’t want me to play like him, which is kind of nice. I guess I should have listened to that more from him. I was just trying to get it right, really. There’s some things I couldn’t get and those were the wrong things in the music until I finally realized that those “mistakes” I was making were not actually real mistakes. That was me! I was never going to be able to play like him because I wasn’t him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Spending time with him was really effective in that process, too, because it was obvious we were just such different people. I could never be the kind of person that he was, and I shouldn’t! Part of it was that he was suffering so much, it was just painful. It was so hard and there were times when he would say, “Hey, I can give you a lesson tomorrow,” and I would just say, “Yeah, I can’t do it,” because I couldn’t bear the thought of spending time with him when he was really a mess because it just hurt too much to see somebody like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It made me do a lot of soul searching because it was just what you have to do, it’s the kind of person you have to be to make really good music. I definitely came to the conclusion that it’s not worth it. I still feel that way. If that is how much pain you have to be in–and he caused a lot of other pain, too. I mean, he gave a lot of people joy, but there was a lot of people around him and he caused a lot of pain. I didn’t think it was worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, yeah, I realized that that’s just not me and these little reflections when I’d try to play his music, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;those things never &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; going to go away and they shouldn’t because those little things are me&lt;/span&gt;. So, I’d try to turn it around and develop those things instead of just trying to get rid of them from my music. Trying to develop those things, tended to be like little phrasing things, tonal things that he did because of the structure of his hands and the structure of his mind. Certain things that he would play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So I stopped trying to do those things and then more and more things that he did. But at the same time, there were things he did that I could do well, so I tried to hold on to those things. I always want my music to reflect the enormous respect and appreciation and love that I have for his amazing accomplishment, but it started to be more about these other places to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Spending time with Michael Hedges was great because he was very much in that mode, too, and he &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt; Jaco. Loved him to death. Loved him almost as much as I did, but he recognized that there might be other places to go. So, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;it was really great to have somebody to bounce ideas off and to share things with and try things with&lt;/span&gt;. Michael was fearless. Fearlessly creative, I guess you’d say. He would try all kinds of crazy things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/kBPKmyH1f2w?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I think of myself in somewhat that way, too. At the same time that all this was happening, I’ve always been one of these people who didn’t tend to say “no” to gigs. Largely because I couldn’t afford it! If anybody offered to pay me anything, I had to take the gig.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-bass-itself&quot;&gt;The Bass Itself&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: At what point did you start experimenting with the hardware of the instrument? Nobody does what you do, which is part of what makes you so interesting to watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Hah. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Listening to your music, if you weren’t a technician on a stringed instrument, you’d probably never realize that you are constantly changing your instrument and the strings through hardware augmentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Thank you! I’m glad that it’s not that clear because I’m always worried that the techniques will overshadow the music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Not when you hear it. When watching, it’s almost like this whole other world of WOW.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Good! I can’t say I care that much for how it looks, but I want it to sound nice. That’s the important thing. There were a lot of different things going on and I ended up doing a lot of very unusual gigs of all different kinds. I was also very into avant garde music, so I played a lot of way-out-there stuff. I played in a band once where it was myself, a guy who played a whole bunch of stuff that he had mounted on an old wheelchair that he would bang with things, and another guy who dragged a huge chain around on a piece of plywood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Sounds about right. New York?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Pretty far out there. We were all New York guys. We did this one in DC, actually. All two gigs we had for that band. There was a lot of different things going on and just a lot of experimenting, trying different things. At the same time, I had met &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darol_Anger&quot;&gt;Darol Anger &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Marshall_(musician)&quot;&gt;Mike Marshall &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and I’m not sure they get the credit they deserve for how incredibly creative they were. I mean, almost off the charts, actually, because those guys would just do &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; creative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;At the time, they were well known for creating this fusion of jazz and bluegrass, which is really amazing, but they were just completely fearless creatively. One of the things that really impressed me is they wanted to have this certain kind of band and Daryl, he’s a violinist, he wanted to be the bass player, somehow, in the band. That was his idea. He wanted to be a bass player somehow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: While you were in the band?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: No, I wasn’t in this band. It was a band that they had. But, he wanted to do the bass function somehow, so he got a cheap old cello and put flat wound electric bass strings on it, but still tuned it in fifths, like a violinist tuned, so that he could play it, and he just played it like a bass. I can’t remember even how he tuned it. He just said, “Okay, I’m a bass player now.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;That kind of fearlessness really impressed me. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;The important thing is the ideas and you don’t need to have any barriers to your passions&lt;/span&gt;, I guess is what I’m thinking. So that really struck me and made me think more about taking more chances creatively and trying different things and starting to look at the instrument and different ways the instrument could work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;There’s this tendency among us bass players to think that the bass was perfected in 1962 by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Fender&quot;&gt;Leo Fender &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with the 1962 &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fender_Jazz_Bass&quot;&gt;Fender Jazz Bass &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It was the perfect form and that it could never get any better than that. There’s nothing wrong with that way of thinking. That’s a totally fine way of thinking, but there may be other ways to think about the bass and those other ways may create maybe even as much music as has been created by thinking about the Fender bass of 1962 being the highest pinnacle that can ever be reached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I hope so, considering you play a 3-octave fretless neck with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detuner&quot;&gt;Hipshot detuners &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; everywhere you look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;alternate-tunings&quot;&gt;Alternate Tunings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Yeah, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I kind of decided to join that camp and just see what else was possible&lt;/span&gt;, what could be done. I had always been interested in tuning the bass in unusual ways and was very discouraged from doing that by my friends and teachers and colleagues. And rightly so! If you want to play Led Zeppelin tunes, there’s no point in using a tuning different from what they were using. But if you want to do something else, then it might be wise to use different techniques and tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;One of the things I discovered is that you can tune a bass to anything. It’s such a strong instrument compared to other instruments that it’ll take all kinds of altered tunings. And then &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;hanging out with Hedges, he was completely fearless about tuning his guitar&lt;/span&gt;. One of the things he did is he was really interested in using these different tunings and one of the drawbacks of doing that is, especially if you use a really low tuning, it decreases the tension on the acoustic guitar and the acoustic guitar becomes much quieter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, it can be really hard to hear a guitar that’s tuned really low. But he was finding ways of playing the acoustic guitar electrically, really innovative ways of doing that, many of which have become standardizations now that many of the crazy ideas he had when we were poor starving musicians that he was cobbling together with duct tape and paperclips have become standard ways of doing things. Kind of bizarre. But because he was able to amplify the guitar, he found ways to amplify it really, really loud levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;In fact, for a while, he was into playing &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;, really loud. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Some of the loudest gigs I’ve ever played were just duo gigs with Hedges.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;He was able to use a lot wider variety of tunings and to see that kind of creativity, I would feel stupid if I didn’t try to see if the same kind of lack of limitations could be pursued on the bass. So, there was this wonderful time where I was just around a lot of really creative people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;musical-experimentation&quot;&gt;Musical Experimentation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;In New York, I had been around this really dark kind of scene and the music tended to be very dark, kind of also very chromatic harmonically, not a lot of prettiness in what we were doing in those days, and I kind of got burned out on that. I kind of started to feel a little–I don’t know, a little unnecessary in some way. I just kind of wanted to play something–&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I found myself in those days wanting to play something pretty and naïve.&lt;/span&gt; Something that wasn’t cynical and heavy and dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, moving in that direction, and that didn’t go over well in New York, that was not something people wanted to hear there, but I was coming out here [San Francisco] a lot and people here were really interested in that kind of sound. Hedges was also interested in that kind of sound. He had been doing a lot of contemporary music, a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atonality&quot;&gt;atonal &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; music. There’s no &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonality&quot;&gt;tonal center &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, there’s no “home,” it’s all really dense intellectually and not a lot of hand-holding for the listener.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So we both were kind of in this place where we wanted to experiment with music that was–I guess we didn’t feel obligated to do that. We could go there if we wanted to, but we didn’t feel like we had to. A lot of other people were that way, too. Some of our heroes: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Riley&quot;&gt;Terry Riley &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, still alive, still making amazing music, still a huge hero, was doing that. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Reich&quot;&gt;Steve Reich &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; also, who was in Terry’s band actually, one of Terry’s first bands making amazing music and just a huge hero to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/r4AysS-WN0A?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;That was something that was kind of happening and we were interested in pulling that into the mix, too. Basically as much as we could get into the mix! That’s what we wanted to do, all these different kinds of sounds. Little by little, these things just gelled out of all these different approaches. And our own abilities and limitations and just wanted to enjoy it, really. Just wanted to have fun at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tuning-the-bass&quot;&gt;Tuning the Bass&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: When did these hardware augmentations pop in?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Oh, right. So, I got interested in all these different tunings that could be used on the bass and I realized there were &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; many tunings you could use on the bass. In fact, I often tell people that it’s really easy to tune a bass string over the range of about a 5th, and that’s 8 notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, if you have a 4-string bass and each of the strings can be tuned to 8 different notes, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;the number of possible tunings that you can have on that instrument is 8 times 8 times 8 times 8, which is 4,096&lt;/span&gt;. That’s a lot of tunings! That’s more music than (possibly) pieces you’re going to write in your entire life. So, there’s a lot of tunings to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I got interested in the idea of using tunings more dynamically, not having to be just “stuck” with one tuning for the entire piece, being able to move to different tunings. Hedges was really interested in this, too, something we’d talk a lot about and try different things. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;We tried to con guitar builders into coming up with things that would allow us to do this.&lt;/span&gt; Most of them thought we were completely insane. In some cases, probably rightly so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But when I met &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zon_Guitars&quot;&gt;Joe Zon &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, he was the first guy I talked to that said, “Oh, that’s a great idea! We could do that for you!” I was shocked! He had been coming to a lot of my gigs and bringing his lovely instruments. He started saying, “You know, I’d really like to build you a bass.” I said, “I don’t think you want to build what I want.” He said, “No no no, try me!” So I said, “Well, this is what I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want.” So I started describing something very much like the hyperbass that we made. And he said, “Oh yeah, we can do that.” I think sometimes he regretted being so open to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-hyperbass&quot;&gt;The Hyperbass&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;We started working together in, I think it was 1989, maybe 1990. We started working together on this dream bass. He had a lot of really creative ideas, too. So we said, “Let’s just put everything that we can in one instrument and see what happens.” And so we started working on this bass that he ended up dubbing “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zonguitars.com/zonguitars/hyperbass.html&quot;&gt;The Hyperbass &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.” And it was a real project. My part in it was really easy, it was just coming up with weird ideas, but he had to figure out how to make all these things work and it was a lot of things that hadn’t been done before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/LWPHrRwQqVE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;A lot of mechanical challenges, a lot of electronic challenges, a lot of woodworking challenges as well. He made it all work and put it all together and invented this amazing instrument. And I’ve been playing that instrument ever since!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;The Zon Michael Manring Hyperbass. It allows me to change tunings in two different ways.&lt;/span&gt; I can change strings individually or collectively on it. It also has a separate output for each string, so it has a quadrophonic pickup so I can process the sound of each string separately. In addition, there are pickups in the body so I can play it almost like an acoustic instrument, I can tap on the body and create sounds or use those body pickups as an additional sound source. And as you mentioned, it has a very long fingerboard, allows me to play in higher ranges than you can on the normal bass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, I mean, really super super lucky to run into Joe and we’ve had a really close friendship ever since. He’s built a number of other instruments for me. At this point, that’s pretty much all I play is his instruments because I just love them so much and he’s so good at what he does. It’s really been a great partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;composition-on-the-hyperbass&quot;&gt;Composition on the Hyperbass&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: How has this instrument shaped your composition and the physical act of playing since you’ve received it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: It really opens things up. For me, I see it as a logical extension of the bass guitar. I know for a lot of people it seems like something, as you said, from another planet. For me, it’s just a logical next step to make. It’s a real blessing to have this tool that has these whole other set of capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/aY4Ra2KOyas?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;There’s a ton of stuff I haven’t done with it yet.&lt;/span&gt; There’s a lot more that can be done and there are lots of additional design ideas that we’d like to try that we haven’t had the time and money to pursue. So, there’s an awful lot that needs to be done. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;It’s just a thrill to be able to pursue these ideas and see where they go.&lt;/span&gt; And a number of them have really been very fulfilling. There’s a number of things I’ve done with the Hyperbass in particular, a number of pieces that I’ve written that I’ve been playing for 20 years and have just been enormously fulfilling and given me a lot of joy. And other people sometimes seem to like hearing them too, so all the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;working-as-a-solo-bassist&quot;&gt;Working as a Solo Bassist&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Can you tell me about a career as a solo bassist playing the kind of, I’ll call it “weird”…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Please!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: “Weird” doesn’t necessarily mean “bad,” but “weird” means somebody being themselves in a way that you don’t hear often. “Unique” is probably a better term for it. “Weird” is a marketing term. What is that like for you that you’ve made a career of being a “weird” solo bassist? Bass magazines all over the world write about what you do. How has that been and is that the direction you ever expected your career to go?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: I definitely didn’t expect it to happen this way. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;All the smart, well-meaning folks around me told me it wasn’t going to happen.&lt;/span&gt; They all said, “You can do a little bit of this solo bass thing, but it’s not something that anybody’s ever going to be really interested in.” &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;And it didn’t turn out that way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s a funny thing about a creative world like music, as soon as you think you have a rule, you might be right for that month or that year or even that decade. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;But if it’s a creative world, things are going to change and it’s going to be hard to pin things down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So for me, it’s been a real blessing because I just love the instrument so much and when you play it by itself, you can really hear all of its nuance and all of its color. All the little poetry that goes on with the sounds and all the emotions that it’s capable of expressing. And all of the ideas, all the intellectual ideas it’s capable of expressing with all of this sound, both subtle and gross, I suppose, that it’s capable of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;It is an enormously rich instrument&lt;/span&gt;, sonically, because all the time it’s creating very low sounds and very high sounds all the time and a lot of sound in the middle as well. So, the idea of playing it solo has always been a passion for me. It’s something I kept on the back burner for a lot of years because I was passionate about playing other kinds of music as well, but the solo thing is something that I could never really give up because it really is such a beautiful sound, I think, regardless of who’s playing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Overall, it’s just felt really lucky to have found myself there, especially after Hedges died and I didn’t have somebody, that really close friend, anymore to play with. Then doing more solo stuff really felt good. I don’t know what more I can say on that specific topic, but it really has been a blessing to do that. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I’m just so thrilled and so thankful that people are accepting of it because I think it is a bit of a stretch as a listener.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;When you ask anyone to listen to anything new, people have busy lives and most people don’t want to spend a lot of time on music and they’re stretching their minds so much just to survive in this world, you kind of hate to ask them to stretch them anymore just in listening to music. But there are people who like to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: And they’re all over the world and you now have the capability to reach them. It’s awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: It’s amazing. I mean, it really is amazing. That’s one of the thrills about it for me. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;This kind of music is equally effective in Bogota as it is in Boca Raton.&lt;/span&gt; So, you can go all over the world, there’s kind of no reason not to play everywhere. I’ve had the chance to travel all around and play this crazy music for people and it’s been amazing. I wouldn’t have traveled much, I think, myself if I didn’t need to. If I wasn’t invited to by the music-making process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I’m actually kind of a home-body. One of the things I enjoy most is just sitting by myself and playing music. It’s been a great privilege to be able to travel around and have amazing experiences and meet incredible people and see incredible things all over the world. That bizarre, amazing, wonderful magic of being able to have music connect people. I’ve played in a couple bands where no two people spoke the same language and yet we could–it’s a terrible cliché–we could communicate through the medium of music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Even though it’s a cliché, I never get tired of that magical aspect–&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;one of the many magical aspects of music of completely obliterating all kinds of barriers and borders, linguistic and geographic and cultural, even.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Well, that is fantastic. I think we need to wrap it up, but I have a hundred more questions so if we can do this again in the future…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: I’d love to. Thank you so much for coming to my home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I really appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: My pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interview-video&quot;&gt;Interview video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a video of the interview:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/NtdaEW5ARcQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interview-transcript&quot;&gt;Interview transcript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Jan: It’s always, yeah, grass is greener on the other side. It’s always that I am wanting the other thing that I do not have right now. When I’m in a metal concert, I’m listening to a metal band and I’m missing the improvisation. At a jazz concert, sometimes I’m missing the wrecking ball.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Being in the metal community, being the one who’s actually into jazz, or being among jazz guys always wanting to be the metal guy, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;always wanting to be the different guy, to do something different, to be different from the others&lt;/span&gt;… It’s a desire that comes from myself and that’s the same contrast that I need. You automatically get it at the same time when performing songs that incorporate both elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;That’s kind of the fulfillment of this desire. You get something of both worlds in one thing and you don’t crave for the other element anymore because you’re already not far away from it. You’re just performing both. Does that make sense?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;Anthony: Yeah, it does. That leads me to two questions: Is a song a small enough context to provide that fulfillment? And secondly, when the song is so complex that it takes so much effort to learn how to improvise over it, doesn’t that take away from the joy of improvisation because you have to work so hard to even get to the point where you can improvise on it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;That’s the hard work of being able to enjoy it: to practice it an extent that you get freedom.&lt;/span&gt; That’s the actual work on improvisation. It’s always to be free, to get options from where you are. To get these options, you need to work out ways to finding these options. That’s the mastering of improvisation. That was one part of your question and the other…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Is within a song a small enough thing? You said, “When I’m in a group, I’m always looking somewhere else.” Does a song provide enough for you to be present in the moment and to be content with the improvisational piece when you’re improvising and to be content with the through-composed parts when you’re playing those?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: Yes it is because the song is designed in a way to fulfill that desire automatically. Some songs that don’t have improvisation, like &lt;em&gt;Mahna Mahna&lt;/em&gt;, which doesn’t have improvisation. The song is quite short, but if it was 8 minutes long and it wouldn’t have improvisation, then I would miss something. Since it’s 2 minutes, that’s okay for a non-improvisational part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;When it’s a whole song without improvisation, something is definitely missing. So, most of the songs have a well-balanced ratio–what means “well-balanced?” Well, enough balance for fulfilling the desired ratio of improvisation versus composition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/bEdh3IjJ9Gk?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Once you write these songs, you compose them… I’m guessing you write charts out for people. The band, I assume, has enough freedom to do what they want and what you’re writing is like recommendations in some areas and very specific in other areas. How does the band treat receiving a chart from you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;As far as I understand, you don’t all live in the same place, so you probably have to practice to a certain extent on your own and when you come together, it’s a different form of practice, as you mentioned in part 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: When I compose, I write out the parts and I do a pre-production of every song. Regarding the saxophone and the bass and the first guitar (melody guitar), there are not many modifications that musicians do to it except some phrasing, or maybe for the guitar, Joe adds some expression or articulation or bendings or some special techniques to make it nice-sounding. Joe is a very, very good guitar player. Particularly, this is one of his specialities: to take a melody from a MIDI file and make it sound really nice on guitar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Then there’s the drums. Because I’m not a drummer, I can just offer Sebastian something. Parts of them he takes them as they are, but most of it he rearranges and makes his own drum arrangements. This is totally insane stuff. I would never get the idea to write like it. Much of it is drum-specific stuff that I just don’t know. Extremely specific things and techniques that he practices and ideas that he gets. He gets many, many ideas, and I let him do whatever he wants. His drum parts are way more complex than what I write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/TquaiwpQXKc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;In the end, every musician has to spend time learning his part, which is kind of hard already. But then there is a second part of it, like putting it together in the band. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;If you’re able to play along with the computer in pre-production, that doesn’t mean you can play it together&lt;/span&gt; with everyone having his own interpretation. Because the structure is so sophisticated, everyone is making little… playing a little ahead of time, or some notes are a little too long or too fast or too slow… just a really little bit, but this little bit is enough to make the whole construction not sound well and make the parts not fit together well enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Not even putting together the single elements and rehearsing as a collective band is an important part. We don’t have much time to do this because two of us live in Austria and three of us live in Munich. It takes at least… Either we rehearse in Salzburg, which is almost a 2-hour drive, and then we have to set up, which takes time as well. And Joe comes from Linz. When he comes to Munich, he has to drive 3 hours just one way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s a lot of time on the day we rehearse before we play the first note. So, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;the time we have is precious. We have to be very effective.&lt;/span&gt; Everyone has to really be able to play his part perfectly so we can do this process of putting together. It’s like having a complex sculpture and you have all the single parts and you have to then meet and everyone has his part and you have to put them together. You have to make some tiny adjustments. You notice that somebody plays one note a little too long or the phrasing is a little different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Little mistakes lead to collective errors in the band.&lt;/span&gt; Little mistakes are often already enough to make it not happen as it should be in the collective. So, we rehearse, it takes us maybe one or two rehearsals for one song. When there are new principles, like the quintuplet thing, then it takes us longer. I think I already talked about that in part 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/dRa_OUPNR58?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Do you have more that you want to get out of the band? Or is it doing just what you are hoping for compositionally, in terms of performance…? Are there areas where you’re seeing a lot of opportunity for growth? Or it’s just great for what it is and you’ll continue to evolve and you’re excited about that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: Yeah, it’s the latter. It took so much time to find something and rehearse it and bring it on stage and now it’s kind of a working machine. So, I know I can just go on being creative into this direction and I know there will be new, awesome stuff happening at some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s kind of found its own long-term groove of how to create and arrange this music, rehearse, bring it on stage… Experimenting inside of these parameters with this instrumentation, I think there is still a lot to exploit. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;This is where I’m aiming: becoming more and more awesome and more and more sophisticated and complex.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I guess I can only think of one more question and it’s 3:40 in the morning. But that’s okay. And the question just left me. Give me one second. Oh! Yes! So, how would you characterize or articulate what this music has done for you in your life? How have you grown personally through making weird music?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: Personally, I would say just &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;doing this thing is the most satisfying experience for me as a musician.&lt;/span&gt; It has been by far the most satisfying because it’s nice to be a side-man playing music from other other composers, other bands, or doing stuff in other bands, cover bands… The diversity makes it exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But, still &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;everything is not half as satisfying as doing your own thing&lt;/span&gt; and knowing that there is no end to it so you can always go on and on and on and finding new stuff. That’s how I assign the importance or priority in doing this Panzerballett stuff. It’s my first priority of what I want to go on with and what I put my efforts into emotionally. As a musician, it makes me my source of inspiration  of what I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/DnYs2vVi4QA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;When I wake up and start practicing, I know I want to. It used to be like that. When I didn’t have it, it used to be a random thing I liked, different stuff. What I practiced wasn’t as focused as what it is now. Now I want to be really… I got the &lt;em&gt;Erkenntnis&lt;/em&gt;… What is that in German? The awareness or knowledge that you cannot be able to do everything. A country or recording guitarist or classical guitarist. There are so many great aspects of playing guitar, but the time is limited and you have to focus on something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I think by &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;making weird music, I’ve found something that’s really myself&lt;/span&gt; and that’s what I can do good. That’s my cup of tea. That’s what I can do best. That’s what I have to. I know I have to really specialize in order to get a chance to be recognized by the world. Otherwise, I don’t have a chance because there are so many good musicians. You have to find a way to do your own thing &lt;em&gt;and then&lt;/em&gt; putting 100% into it and then you have a chance to be recognized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I think I’ve found the thing that I can do best so now I know what to focus on way better. I know, “Well, maybe I should check out more of this technique or that technique” and it’d be great to be a nice flamenco player. Why not? But, when just starting to do it, I recognize, “No!”” &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;It would take so much longer and it would distract from what I can do best&lt;/span&gt;, which is this weird thing. I need to focus on the weird stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Personally, I’ve recognized in myself: &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;focus on what you can do and not what you can’t do&lt;/span&gt; and can do not that well and what’s “nice,” but maybe not nice enough. Focus on something you really do well. That’s what I think and that’s what I’m going to do. It makes the choice so easy when getting up! “What should I do now?” I focus on just getting better in what I already do, which happens and gives me satisfaction. I’m getting better and I want to get even better. I won’t become a big shredder, probably, but in my own style, I will become better and this makes it exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: That’s great. Well, thank you so much for your time. I really appreciate you spending all this time with me and exploring these themes. It’s really wonderful. So, thank you very much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: You’re extremely welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: All right, Jan. I appreciate it and, I don’t know, we’ll talk again I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: I’m wishing you a good night. My day starts now and I’m going to have some breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: All right. Have a good one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;J: You too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-end&quot;&gt;The end!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After four magnificent interview “parts,” this interview can be considered complete.&lt;/p&gt;
