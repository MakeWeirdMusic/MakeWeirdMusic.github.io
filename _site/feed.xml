        <title>Discover MoonJune Records</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-little-about-moonjune-records&quot;&gt;A LITTLE ABOUT MoonJune Records&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time I saw something musically interesting on Facebook, I’d see the name Leonardo MoonJune Pavkovic. We were already “friends” on Facebook, but had never interacted. We had enough mutual friends that it made sense and we were commenting on a lot of the same posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Months later, &lt;a href=&quot;/interview/markus-reuter&quot;&gt;Markus Reuter&lt;/a&gt;’s double-CD sampler, &lt;a href=&quot;https://markus-reuter-moonjune.bandcamp.com/album/fool-of-music-compilation-free-download&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fool of Music&lt;/em&gt; was available for free &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://moonjunerecords.bandcamp.com&quot;&gt;MoonJune’s BandCamp site &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so I decided to do a little research and see what that was all about. It was pretty astounding. On the MoonJune website was a collection of names I’d never seen before playing astonishing music at extremely generous prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leonardo was very friendly and fast to respond to my Facebook messages requesting an interview. In fact, he was ready to do an interview at 9AM the next morning!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;video&quot;&gt;Video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the video of the interview with Leonardo Pavkovic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;leonardos-recommendations&quot;&gt;Leonardo’s Recommendations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the recommendations Leonardo made from his MoonJune catalog to get you started:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.moonjune.com/mjr_web_2013/catalog_mjr/075_DWIKI-DHARMAWAN_So-Far-So-Close_MJR075/&quot;&gt;Dwiki Dharmawan &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.moonjune.com/mjr_web_2013/catalog_mjr/068_simakDialog_Live-at-Orion_MJR068/&quot;&gt;simakDialog’s &lt;em&gt;Live at Orion&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll also add &lt;a href=&quot;https://markus-reuter-moonjune.bandcamp.com/album/fool-of-music-compilation-free-download&quot;&gt;Markus Reuter’s &lt;em&gt;Fool of Music&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; since it’s free and fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ad&quot;&gt;And TONS of music is available for free at &lt;a href=&quot;https://moonjunerecords.bandcamp.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MoonJune’s BandCamp site&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interview-transcript&quot;&gt;Interview Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;Anthony: Hi, this is Anthony from MakeWeirdMusic.com and I’m here with Leonardo Pavkovic from MoonJune Records based in New York City. Leonardo, thanks so much for joining us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Leonardo: Hi Anthony, thank you very much for inviting me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Can you tell me who you are and what you do and give us a brief introduction to MoonJune Records?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;L: I’ve been running MoonJune Records and management since 2001. I am based in New York City and &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I started the record label by accident with the intent to help a couple of friends.&lt;/span&gt; I really didn’t know what I was doing except that I was helping my friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And then a couple of years later, because I started managing the band called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_Machine&quot;&gt;Soft Machine Legacy &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is the continuation of Soft Works that is sort of Soft Machine but became Soft Works in 2001 with &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Holdsworth&quot;&gt;Allan Holdsworth &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elton_Dean&quot;&gt;Elton Dean &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Hopper&quot;&gt;Hugh Hopper &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Marshall_(drummer)&quot;&gt;John Marshall &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;–the band then became Soft Machine Legacy with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Etheridge&quot;&gt;John Etheridge &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; coming in the band after Allan Holdsworth, who for whatever reason wasn’t able to continue with the band. Then I started booking this band in Europe and they needed a new album because we had a great album of Soft Works with Allan, but they didn’t do anything with John Etheridge in the new band, but they just changed the name of the band from Soft Works to Soft Machine Legacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/FpYXWn0cVBs?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Then in 2005, I actually started being a label even though I started in 2001, but I believe that in 2004–after 3 years–I really decided that this is what I should do. And again, my label started with the idea just to help my friends in a couple of bands I was involved with. And that’s what I’ve done for 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So far, I have 80 releases to my label and I also do management and booking. I work with a lot of artists not necessarily on my label. I book maybe about 3 dozen artists on a non-exclusive basis all around the world, mostly in Asia, Latin America, some in Europe and USA. I do some other things, but that’s basically what I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I know it’s very difficult nowadays to run a record label. Do you have a very dedicated fan base? Is it an act of love?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;L: Yes, I have to underline something. When I started my label, my first releases were releases from bands that had a nice cult following. Two Italian progressive rock bands, &lt;a href=&quot;https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finisterre_(gruppo_musicale)&quot;&gt;Finisterre &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFA_(Italian_rock_band)&quot;&gt;D.F.A. &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and my old friend, the legendary Elton Dean. Somehow I was able to get some decent industry success in a niche market with those albums. Then I released a tribute to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaco_Pastorius&quot;&gt;Jaco Pastorius &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; helping a friend of mine who produced that album and then I started releasing albums by Soft Machine Legacy, Elton Dean and Hugh Hopper, and Italian progressive rock legend &lt;a href=&quot;https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arti_e_Mestieri&quot;&gt;Arti &amp;amp; Mestieri &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Miller&quot;&gt;Phil Miller &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/RkrQnE3_N_0?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;In the beginning with the first 15 or 16 releases, I had albums that were kind of selling. Of course we’re not talking about huge sales, we’re talking about decent sales. Then I started releasing albums of literally-unknown bands from Indonesia, Spain, Italy, Canada, Brazil, Japan, and then many things have changed in the last 10 years in the recording business, but &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I don’t make a living from my label. It’s impossible.&lt;/span&gt; I make a living from other things, but I decided that I have to keep alive my label because it’s something that I like and, as I mentioned before, the label is based on music of my friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I don’t sign artists. There is no such thing where you’d send me a demo and I’d consider it and say, “Okay, I will sign you and I’ll give you a contract.” I don’t do that. I’m a completely unusual label, and again, I only work and release albums of my friends.&lt;/span&gt; We become friends for whatever magic reason. There is music happening and we record some albums and we say, “Okay, let’s release this album.” I’m very unusual and I’m happy to be that way because it doesn’t restrict me to obey certain rules of the music business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Especially lately with &lt;a href=&quot;/interview/markus-reuter&quot;&gt;Markus Reuter&lt;/a&gt;, who became a very close friend of mine. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;We have a very unusual way of promoting the music, which I started about 6 or 7 years ago offering free music through downloads and free music through downloads means reaching more people and, actually, we can make some money offering free music because people are really generous. They download it for free and making donations.&lt;/span&gt; We’re collecting more and more funds and we’re building a very solid fanbase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/XqTz4M5k2FQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Of course, I have a lot of fans of Soft Machine, John Etheridge, Allan Holdsworth. These are legends. And now, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stick_Men_(prog_band)&quot;&gt;Stick Men &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I’m just building the niche audience. I like to interact directly with fans and my email list is about 15,000 people that I collected in the last 15 years, which is through my mail-order company and collecting emails on the live shows of Soft Machine Legacy and Allan Holdsworth and other bands and simply people signing up for my newsletter and offering those free downloads and people are sending their contributions as they’re downloading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, that’s how I build my niche reach. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Of course, I have national and international distribution, but in today’s age, that really doesn’t mean anything because there are no more stores. It’s very hard, but as I said, I don’t do this for a living. I’m just doing this because I love the music and they’re my friends and we are doing this together.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So, first of all, thank you so much for what you do. It’s awesome to see someone so passionate doing what you’re doing. It’s incredible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;L: &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;It’s not just passion. It’s my duty.&lt;/span&gt; When my friend Elton Dean gave me a live tape of his tour with English guitar player &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Hewins&quot;&gt;Mark Hewins &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2000 when he visited New York and I knew Elton since the mid 1980s. I met him in Italy and he toured Italy very often and we became friends. We were friends since 1986. When he offered me this tape and when I met a couple other Italian bands that became my fans, I said, “Okay, this is what I have to do.” They asked me for help and I said, “Okay, I’ll release these albums and I’ll see what I can do for you in the USA.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/YBcSv6OhjRY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;That’s how it started and it’s more than passion. It’s also duty to help friends. We are all helping each other. Of course, we are living in very troubled times, not just in terms of the music business, but in general. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Music is something that can unify people and make us happy and enjoy what we do. I think that’s something that will continue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;That’s why I am saying, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;no matter how the music business may be bad in the future, I’m the record label that will never ever fail or never go bankrupt because I don’t follow any rules that normally record labels are following. That’s why I will always exist.&lt;/span&gt; I might start releasing less albums, but I’ll be always there because of my very, very unusual way of promoting and distributing and selling this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: That’s fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;L: It’s something that I learned. It’s not something that I said 15 years ago and envisioned. I decided 15 years ago I thought it would be something else, but this is something I have learned because I believe the way of promoting independent music from now is just making partnerships with musicians. We are doing it together. Of course &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;we know that from some of this music we cannot be rich, we cannot make any living. But collectively if we contribute to the cause, something will happen.&lt;/span&gt; We don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Are you a musician yourself?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;L: No, I’m not a musician. My grandmother was an opera singer. She bought me a guitar when I was 10 years old and she wanted me to become a musician because she was a musician. I learned a lot of music from her, especially classical music. But after 1 or 1 1/2 years, I resisted. I was 12 years old. I thought I had some other interests. I never played an instrument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Also, I’ve never driven a car in my life. I’m very unusual. I’ve been married 23 years and I don’t have a ring. I just feel free. Once they asked Frank Zappa what kind of music he liked, he said, “I don’t know what I like because I have my own music. I don’t have time to listen to other music.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;But because I’m not a musician, it gives me complete and total freedom.&lt;/span&gt; First of all, to listen a lot to music. Musicians that are performing all over again, playing the same music every night, the same kind of music, and they’re rehearsing, and sound-checking, and performing gigs… I use that time to listen to more and more different music. And the fact that I’m a musician gives me opportunity to listen to music in a very neutral way. I’m not paying attention to technique, like if this guy is playing in this-and-that way, but just enjoying the music. For me, the music comes first and then technical abilities and everything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: That’s great. So, what are your top 3 or 5 records that you’d recommend from your label for people who are looking to expand their musical horizons?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ROg6uEaPkzI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;L: My upcoming record that I’m announcing today, one track, and announcing next week an album that will come out in late September, is a double album of &lt;a href=&quot;https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwiki_Dharmawan&quot;&gt;Dwiki Dharmawan &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an Indonesian piano player. On this double album he’s playing only acoustic piano. That’s probably one of the highlights of my label because it’s something very special. Dwiki Dharmawan is one of the nationally most well-known musicians in Indonesia and a very good friend of mine for 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;We recorded this album in London last year and we are finally releasing it with some of the top musicians, my favorite musicians in the world, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Wingfield&quot;&gt;Mark Wingfield &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilad_Atzmon&quot;&gt;Gilad Atzmon &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamelan_jegog&quot;&gt;Gamelon Jess Jegog &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meiergroup.com/meiergroup/index.html&quot;&gt;Nicholas Meier &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That’s an upcoming release that I will promote starting today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Regarding the older catalog, I’ll also mention a couple other Indonesian artists like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tohpati&quot;&gt;simakDialog &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; double live album recorded in Baltimore on the first USA tour a few years ago called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.moonjune.com/mjr_web_2013/catalog_mjr/068_simakDialog_Live-at-Orion_MJR068/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Live at Orion&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s one of my favorite live albums in the past 20 years, not just on my label.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/X0tK3hDiA3c?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Another Indonesian guitar player, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewa_Budjana&quot;&gt;Dewa Budjana &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. His album with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinnie_Colaiuta&quot;&gt;Vinnie Colaiuta &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Johnson_(bassist)&quot;&gt;Jimmy Johnson &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That’s one of the highlights of my label. And then, I’ll also recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wrong_Object&quot;&gt;The Wrong Object &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; band from Belgium led by a friend of mine, Belgian guitar player &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Delville&quot;&gt;Michel Delville &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is kind of–if you like &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/frank-zappa&quot;&gt;Frank Zappa&lt;/a&gt;, Soft Machine, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magma_(band)&quot;&gt;Magma &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terje_Rypdal&quot;&gt;Terje Rypdal &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, that’s kind of some of my favorite musicians. It’s very great experimental jazz rock. There are many albums. I have 80 albums, but I have so many albums that if I start mentioning albums, I’ll have to mention probably all 80 of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: And the new Stick Men record?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;L: Stick Men is not really a MoonJune album. It’s kind of a MoonJune album. It’s not 100% MoonJune because it started doing something very unusual. We released it by ourselves. It only came out officially in Japan. It’s an album that we’re only selling at our shows and on BandCamp. It’s a sort of MoonJune because I’m involved with the band, I’m their exclusive booking representative. It’s almost MoonJune records, but it’s not 100% MoonJune. Of course, it’s one of my favorite live albums and it’s simply amazing, especially–it’s very special because my old friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cross_(musician)&quot;&gt;David Cross &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;A couple of these Stick Men guys will be on my label. I will be releasing the upcoming new studio album of Markus Reuter in January with members of the Swiss avant garde band, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonar_(band)&quot;&gt;Sonar &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Levin&quot;&gt;Tony Levin &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is already on a couple of albums that I’ll be releasing very soon on the new Dewa Budjana album, Indonesian guitar player. He plays upright bass and we’re having a recording session this Sunday in the Woodstock area with a Serbian guitar player on my label who lives in Barcelona, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.moonjune.com/mjr_web_2013/catalog_mjr/058_DUSAN-JEVTOVIC_Am-I-Walking-Wrong_MJR058/&quot;&gt;Dusan Jevtovic &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Spanish Catalan drummer &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.moonjune.com/mjr_web_2013/catalog_mjr/062_XAVI-REIJA_Resolution_MJR062/&quot;&gt;Xavi Rejia &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That’s Xavi’s album with Markus Reuter as a special guest, which means that all these Stick Men musicians are gradually moving to the MoonJune area first as session musicians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;In the case of Markus Reuter, I’ll be releasing his new studio album, and he’s also in a collective improvisational band with English guitar player Mark Wingfield and two Israeli guys based in London, bass player &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.allaboutjazz.com/yaron-stavi-profoundly-bassist-yaron-stavi-by-sammy-stein.php&quot;&gt;Yaron Stavi &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and drummer &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asaf_Sirkis&quot;&gt;Asaf Sirkis &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and that album will come out in November. That’s another album that I will consider one of the highlights of my label in the last 15 years because, first of all, features some of my favorite musicians on planet Earth: Markus, Mark, Yaron Stavi, Asaf Sirkis Some of my favorite musicians. The music is just completely and totally improvised music, but it’s very melodic and very groovy and very jammy and I think it’ll blow everybody’s minds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Excellent. Thank you so much for your time. I really appreciate it and I really appreciate what you do. Thank you for making Fool of Music a free download. I love it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;L: Thank you very much for inviting me. Hope to talk to you soon. I’ll see you in January, I suppose, in Phoenix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: That’s right. For the Stick Men show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;L: Last time I was in Phoenix was 20 years ago. Looking forward to coming back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: January’s a great time to come. Now [August] is not a great time to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;L: Okay, thank you Anthony. Talk to you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Bye.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Failure to Fracture, Ep. 2</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;episode-2-round-and-sharp-picks&quot;&gt;Episode 2: Round (and Sharp) Picks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dgmlive.com/diaries.htm?entry=3463&quot;&gt;Robert Fripp paid me a compliment in his online diary&lt;/a&gt; in response to videos and blog posts I’d written at that time about playing &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt;. He said, “Mr. Garone’s work on this is honourable, and has my respect.” This sentence motivated me for many years to continue pursuing &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, he made a recommendation that, for some reason, took me years to understand: use a sharp pick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/fracture/id978457922?i=978458012&quot;&gt;Purchase King Crimson’s &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt; on iTunes &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://store.nexternal.com/dgm/starless-and-bible-black-c228.aspx&quot;&gt;Or, purchase the album on Robert Fripp’s website &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;video&quot;&gt;Video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the video to accompany this episode of &lt;em&gt;Failure to Fracture&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/p3vYVtplGi8&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-failure-to-fracture&quot;&gt;What is &lt;em&gt;Failure to Fracture&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/learn/fracture&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Failure to Fracture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a video series I’ve put together about all the things that have stood in the way of my successfully playing the song &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/king-crimson&quot;&gt;King Crimson&lt;/a&gt; despite years and years of study, practice, writing, and making videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/learn/fracture/picks&quot;&gt;Episode 2: Picking Picks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-problems-with-round-picks&quot;&gt;The Problems with Round Picks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Playing &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt; with a round pick is like slicing a ripe tomato with a butterknife. (What?!) In my experience, round picks are great for all sorts of players, but for &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt;, they’re just not the right tool for the job. Here are my thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Round picks are more difficult to get a clear, consistent attack&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They need to be nearly parallel to the string for every stroke to maximize sound&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt;’s incessant string skipping makes clear tone quite difficult with a round pick&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Round picks can “slide” across strings instead of connecting me with the notes and strings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I feel like I’m not in control of my playing with round picks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are very personal reasons, but watch the video and you’ll get a sense of the tonal differences between the round and sharp picks. I play the moto perpetuo with both round and sharp picks, alternating between the two so you can get a sense of how the picks make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;picks-picks-picks&quot;&gt;Picks, Picks, Picks!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Mr. Fripp recommended use of a sharp pick, he wrote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The recommended pick is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guitarcraftguitars.com/picks.html&quot;&gt;a triangular Guitar Craft pick&lt;/a&gt;, of which there is a small production line, handmade in Japan by Mr. Hiroshi Iketani. If a Dunlop Tortex is the only choice, I would use the Tortex Sharp &amp;amp; consider that life was hard, cruel &amp;amp; unfair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I had no access to the triangular Guitar Craft pick at the time, I bought &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Dunlop-412P1-0-Tortex%C2%AE-Sharp-Players/dp/B000PTRJW8&quot;&gt;Dunlop Tortex Sharps&lt;/a&gt; and it made a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; difference in tone and accuracy. (I prefer the yellow .73mm ones.) Here’s what I love about them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They make your strings sound &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; brighter and more clear&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pick noise is severely reduced&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They’re slightly longer than a normal pick, so there’s more to grip&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reduces accidental string muting&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sounds much more like Fripp!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a normal pick makes it harder to play &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt; for the reasons I just listed. Normal picks don’t have the clear tone of a sharp pick. They’re noisy and make a lot of noise because you’re almost always rubbing the surface of the pick across a string instead of striking through a string. They’re shorter and not as grippy. Their shortness also makes it hard to let long notes ring during the “death picking” part of &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt;. And if you’re really trying to play like Fripp and sound like him, you’re not going to have good luck with a normal pick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;guitar-craft-triangular-picks&quot;&gt;Guitar Craft Triangular Picks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I attended the Guitar Circle intro course, some official india rubber Guitar Craft picks were available for purchase. It turns out there are two types of GC picks: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_rubber&quot;&gt;india rubber&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyoxymethylene&quot;&gt;delrin&lt;/a&gt;. My india rubber picks are shiny, slick, and fancier than the delrin ones. The delrin ones have a matte, fine texture and I prefer them to the india rubber ones. Guitarist &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.steveball.com/index.htm&quot;&gt;Steve Ball&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.steveball.com/words/history/PickHistory/&quot;&gt;a written history of the picks on his website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These picks are definitely, definitely awesome. Before I had any access to these picks, I bought every sharp pick I could find on the market. The only ones that even come close to the GC picks are the Tortex Sharps Fripp recommended. The biggest advantage (for me) to the triangular pick is that it doesn’t spin or move nearly as much when playing &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;other-sharp-picks&quot;&gt;Other Sharp Picks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I understand that it may be my own poor technique that leads to a spinning pick, but I can say that the triangular pick spins the least of any of the picks I’ve seen. Even as I’ve been making this series, I’ve worked pretty hard on my picking grip and have started re-evaluating other sharp picks as I’m learning to better control the pick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all this work, none of the other sharp picks I have come &lt;em&gt;close&lt;/em&gt; to the Tortex Sharps or the GC picks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/DAndrea-TG355-96HV-Celluloid-Guitar/dp/B001RMDQCY&quot;&gt;D’Andrea triangle picks&lt;/a&gt; are really big. I’ve cut them down to the size of the GC picks, but one of the sides is unfinished.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Jim-Dunlop-478P-88-Tortex®-Players/dp/B00ISQCJRU&quot;&gt;White Dunlop Jazz III picks&lt;/a&gt; are the best of the rest. For GC-style picking that’s suitable for playing &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt;, these are pretty nice, though a little thick for my taste. The other Jazz III picks are just too thick for me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we’re on the subject of picks, there are some pretty crazy picks out there. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Ibanez-0-75mm-Sand-Grip-Plectrums/dp/B004CYEPGU&quot;&gt;Ibanez makes one with a sandpaper grip&lt;/a&gt;! I ordered this crazy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.v-picks.com/product/shredder-lite/&quot;&gt;V-Pick “Shredder Lite” triangular guitar pick&lt;/a&gt; and it’s SUPER sharp, precisely made, but a little too thick for my tastes. It is nearly the same size as the GC picks and works pretty well. There’s even a woman using this technique with a different pick in the New York Guitar Circle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-context&quot;&gt;Some Context&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I attended the Guitar Circle introductory course in Mexico in February 2015, I made a lot of new friends on Facebook. Then, I started hearing a lot about this Markus Reuter guy, seeing him pop up in interesting discussions and seeing my new friends praising his music. Turns out, he’s a very, very experienced GC participant with a unique take on composition, performance, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.markusreuter.com&quot;&gt;Don’t know who Markus Reuter is? Check out his website! &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few hours into research, I saw that he’d basically invented a new kind of guitar called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.touchguitars.com&quot;&gt;Touch Guitar &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, wrote a stunning orchestral ambient piece called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todmorden_513&quot;&gt;Todmorden 513 &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; based on a combinatorial algorithm that generated all sorts of sequences and chord structures, and had a super-unique take on music as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It became immediately obvious that he was an ideal candidate for a MWM interview. Enjoy this no-holds-barred conversation!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interview-transcript&quot;&gt;Interview Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Hi this is Anthony from MakeWeirdMusic.com and I’m here with Markus Reuter, all the way from Berlin. Markus, thank you for joining us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Hello.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: The site is about discovering new artists and expanding your creative horizons. You’re a very creative musician. Can you tell us about yourself and how you got to where you are today?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Well, that’s a very good question. Somehow I got motivated in my very early teens to become a musician but &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;the word “musician” really isn’t big enough to describe what it’s about, what I’m doing. It’s more like I’m trying to find something that I want to hear.&lt;/span&gt; It’s like I have this vision inside me that I somehow feel driven to find what that vision could be in the real world. So it’s been a very, very long process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started, I think, when I was around 9 or 10 years old. Even now at almost 44 years, I feel like I’ve only just started. This feeling of always being uncomfortable where I am as an artist is part of what’s driving me. So the worlds that I’m looking for with my music are undiscovered worlds. So speaking of “weird music,” I believe that &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;there’s still a lot of uncharted territory in music, even though some people believe that everything has been said or done. I think that’s just plain stupid, to tell you the truth.&lt;/span&gt; Especially with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music&quot;&gt;western system &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_scale&quot;&gt;12 notes of the chromatic scale &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; we use, I think there’s still so much more to be said, because almost 100 years [ago], the knowledge was at a high point, really, and then disintegrated a little bit. We had the whole, let’s say, rock n’ roll, pop music thing happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I think we’re at a time now where things start to fuse again. So, there’s all the knowledge of rock and the classical, combined with what used to be called punk, the DIY scene and stuff like that–experimental music. I think we’re in a post-modern time where experimental music and experiments really do not lead to new results anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/176190677&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/176190677&quot;&gt;Susanne Kessel plays: Markus Reuter &amp;quot;His last decade&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/user43222763&quot;&gt;Susanne Kessel&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com&quot;&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;what I’m trying to do is fuse, to build a bridge between old knowledge and new technologies–a new knowledge&lt;/span&gt;, you could say. But it’s really–I could go on talking about it on an abstract level or we can really speak about something specific and I can explain what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Well, you said you get uncomfortable and you try to dislodge yourself from that comfort. What are some of the things that help you to recognize that you are comfortable? What are some of the things you do to dislodge yourself from that comfort?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Mainly, it’s interesting because what does make me feel comfortable is if I don’t understand. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;If I get the feeling that there is something that I don’t understand that makes me happy. That makes me feel comfortable. Because for me, the world is boring.&lt;/span&gt; The world is extremely boring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Let’s just stick to the music, you know. I’m looking for states that make me feel uncomfortable and that means that’s the music that I haven’t heard. That’s like, for example, with my main band, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrozoon&quot;&gt;Centrozoon &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is a German/Swiss project. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;We have this rule that whenever we hear something we played that we don’t like, that’s what we’re going to explore.&lt;/span&gt; If we’re recording, we’re not keeping the things we like. We throw those out but we keep those that we don’t like. We put those recordings out and we treat them like the most beautiful children. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;That’s one way of raising something new. Things that aren’t beautiful. Things that you don’t recognize right away. Things that you actually nurture and then kind of at a later point, in hindsight it becomes beautiful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I think it’s the same with a lot of music, especially with looking at the biographies of a lot of the artists that have been discovered when they’re long dead. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;So it’s really about finding something that hasn’t been said. For me, that really includes that when I’m writing music or creating music, I do want to find a music in a language that no one has heard before.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: You talked about vision. You sound more of like an artist using music to manifest that vision than somebody who explicitly chooses music out of a love or adoration for the craft, in a way. Can you talk about how you came to find music to create that reality of your vision?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/mffn1EfRMy8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: The word “vision” has nothing to do with being visual, you know? It’s not something that’s represented in the sense of vision and it isn’t even represented in the sense of hearing for me. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;It’s really about states of emotions, feelings–and even that doesn’t really cover it. It’s almost like a sixth sense kind of thing, there is something that I do want to capture.&lt;/span&gt; So really, how did I discover that music or sound is the medium? I think the answer is very simple. Sound and vibration is the ultimate medium. It’s what the world is made of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;My understanding of the world, my worldview, is that everything’s a vibration. You can basically track everything down to vibration. You break it down again, but it’s all vibration. That’s why musicians or people who manipulate sound are basically–and let me just use this word carefully–are basically gods, you know, just in the sense of the word that you’re creating the materials that have been used in order to build the world.&lt;/span&gt; So that’s why music really is, for me, the most fundamental art there is. Even though other arts plug into the same thing. Music is the most basic, the most simple, the most important, I would say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So you talked about how everything is a vibration and that music is a very basic fundamental thing in the world. Your ambient music and a lot of your music doesn’t seem to follow a traditional song structure in the rock or western sense of intro-verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge, that kind of thing. Do you feel that that’s a layer that’s been added that’s unnecessary or that you have worked through that and come to understand music differently in a way above or in parallel to that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Yeah, I mean… the idea that musical pieces should be structured into sections–or that you are repeating sections and stuff–that’s really what I call “songwriter music” where the approach is to tell a story that’s usually also told with words. So in a way, the music becomes a secondary thing. I don’t necessarily mean in quality, just in terms of the message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So yes, I have worked with those structures in several projects–things I have produced and also my own projects–and &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I’ve come to realize that there’s the tendency to edit yourself or to edit the music when you’re approaching it like a songwriter because you’re asking yourself–because you’re telling a story, it means you already know what the story is.&lt;/span&gt; That’s not my approach to music, that’s why my music is so different in its form–I don’t know which story you are telling yourself when you’re listening to the music I’m making. So I can’t be–or I try not to intervene, you know, and kind of cut things down to tell my story–but I want you to be able to hear your story. And that’s really where song structures, I think, might work for some people, because you’re still making up your own story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/BEBw4F5HuVI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;But for me, it was just important to kind of let the music speak for itself and for me there’s no such thing as too many repetitions.&lt;/span&gt; It’s really that for me, the music itself–or let’s say because I’m basically composing conceptually. So the musical concept tells me what the structure should be, but it’s not anything that I’m superimposing as a human being in terms of, “Oh, this means that and this means that,” you know? So that’s really the reason why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I mean it’s interesting, like, for example one of my first professional groups, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_String_Choir&quot;&gt;Europa String Choir &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which was a chamber group. There were really interesting things happening when we were writing. We were actually using the songwriter’s approach, but it was fun because &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;we realized sometimes you don’t even want to repeat something twice. You just want to repeat it one and a half times, or two and a half times.&lt;/span&gt; It kind of came together in a recording project in the sense that when we were recording those pieces that have these more interesting complex forms, we figured out, “Ok let’s play at 105BPM and listen back to and see what it sounds like.” “Oh no, it’s a little slow” and we’d try 106. Then we’d try 105.5 and it turned out 105.5 was the right tempo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So what I mean is really what was happening–or what was happening for me–is that I’m kind of raising the resolution of what I’m doing, how I’m experiencing music. So, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation&quot;&gt;DAWs &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that we have that are all set to 120BPM when we open them up and a lot of music is around 120BPM.&lt;/span&gt; And that’s like–it’s sad. It’s especially clear so many people are not listening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So I mean, just saying, it wasn’t meant as a criticism, but as an example that technology kind of gives us this–I mean &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;technology and education that gives us this grid that we believe things should be in, and what I’ve been doing is to kind of raise the solution of that grid for myself. I still believe that a grid is nice, just like I said that we have the 12 notes that we can work with and that there’s still a lot to discover, we can still discover a lot within that grid, but we should try to subdivide more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: That’s so interesting. You said that you want people to hear their own story and your stories, but you also said that a lot–or &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of your music at least is released as the songs that you didn’t like, the things that made you uncomfortable. Do you believe that any of the discomfort carries to the listener? Or is it just that was your experience and you believe they’ll still find their own?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: So &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;the funny thing is that what I actually said was that it makes me feel comfortable. It’s the discomfort that makes me feel comfortable because the discomfort is the sign that I’ve discovered something.&lt;/span&gt; I hope and I believe that’s what’s carrying over to the listener too, yes? I think so! There’s something that you need to latch onto as a listener.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Just as a human being, we’re going through this world as the most advanced pattern-recognition machine that there is ever going to be, probably. So we’re walking through this world and we’re seeing something. We’re hearing something. We’re feeling something and we latch onto that and we develop an interest in it. So for me, for example, that was actually the band &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/king-crimson&quot;&gt;King Crimson&lt;/a&gt;, which you know, but it wasn’t the music of the bad King Crimson. It was the name. My piano teacher mentioned King Crimson to me and I knew there was something there. I knew there was something behind that name that I needed to follow up on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/z_dZTUA1qNc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Only like 2 years later or so, I discovered the music and it turned out that yes, I was right. So really the pattern recognition–it really extends to, let’s just say “between the lines.” &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;We’re really such amazing beings and we’re not aware of it, really.&lt;/span&gt; Like the subconscious processes so much and it kind of picks up on vibes, yeah? That’s really what I’m very interested in also with my music. Just to kind of feed the subconscious at the same time as the conscious and then I’ll try to get the people to get into this state where somehow the gates open, you know, both going inside and going outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So what people get where they get creative themselves and in a way–and this might sound, I mean it still sounds funny, but I think if there was anything–&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;if you would ask me, “Markus what are you doing here?” I would say that I’m actually a “healer.” I don’t want to be a healer. It’s not that I’ve chosen that.&lt;/span&gt; And just the music for myself, that’s my medium. That’s my world. That’s where I feel good. That’s where I can develop. That’s also the world I can withdraw into. But for other people, I think it does the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Coming back to your question… &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Yes, it makes people feel uncomfortable and that’s a good thing. I don’t need to do things to make people feel comfortable… that’s just not the way I am. It’s not my responsibility to make you feel comfortable.&lt;/span&gt; You should feel comfortable. It’s not my responsibility, but I can create something that might inspire you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So it sounds like… I would imagine that all of this developed over time–this perspective developed as you grew up from an adolescent to adult and then also as somebody who was taking maybe some piano lessons and got formalized education elsewhere on other instruments. Is a lot of this stuff a result of dissatisfaction with standard songwriting in music techniques or is this just kind of… were you born with this intuition? Were you born with these feelings? Can you tell us about the development of this perspective?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Anthony, that’s a very deep question. It’s extremely personal and if you mean that, I can tell you. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I think it’s my childhood and like the greatest musicians, the greatest artists, they had a shit childhood.&lt;/span&gt; My childhood, from my perspective from what I know now wasn’t bad. But maybe there was something. Like for example, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;as a 3 yr old I was alone in the hospital for 3 weeks. I don’t know, maybe that’s why I became a musician. That’s why I have the drive to create. Maybe they tied me down at night. I don’t know. It’s something like that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s really, really simple. I think if we–like all of us, if we look back, there’s something that drives us and it’s usually something bad, you know? I mean it’s like not a lot of people talk about this, because like especially artists and the old model with record companies, you obviously try to keep a distance, so you wouldn’t really say these things. But one of my greatest influences is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Oldfield&quot;&gt;Mike Oldfield &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and he has always been very straightforward about what happened in his childhood. He started to ride out real battles when he was six years old or something. Somehow I think that this drive, and this is something that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud&quot;&gt;Freud &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said we have: the drive to die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q1_VuiMYxtU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;So there’s this drive to die and somehow, some of us become creators and we are all creators. It’s just a continuum. So there’s nobody in this world who’s not creating but some of us just have this need to do that. I’m just one of them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So you talked about being a creator and that possibly stemming from childhood wounds or illness or something bad and then you also said that you found yourself to be a healer for music. Are those things that tie together? Does music heal some of that wound or whatever it is that motivating you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;To be honest I’m not sure if the music is the healer. I think we are still the healers for ourselves. I guess that you can kind of, in a way, misuse music to have an excuse not to heal yourself.&lt;/span&gt; But still, I don’t really believe that anymore, but maybe 10-20 years ago I would have said that’s why we have happy music in the world… to close up our own responsibilities to heal ourselves. But that’s a little extreme. It’s not that way, but it’s food for thought, you know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Consuming things can always distract you and you can distract yourself by looking at the greatest paintings. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;So it’s not necessarily the piece of art itself that is healing, but it provides the materials that you need to heal yourself.&lt;/span&gt; So I mean, like this whole idea of what I said earlier that people who manipulate sound are gods. I also think there is something like that there are demons, but that would be like in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology&quot;&gt;Greek mythology &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I think there is a lot of wisdom in the Greek mythology. The gods themselves–they fail, you know? The demons, there are very bad demons, and there are demons that are not so bad. It’s a spectrum. A spectrum of beings, where I think if we think about it, it makes a whole lot of sense. There are some people that are creating the materials with which the world is being built and there are others that are then on a different level creative, using those materials in order to build something. It’s not really like there’s really good and bad, or a yin and a yang, there are levels of materials that are being generated in this world, and music, I believe, is one of the really basic ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;When I’m talking about music, I’m not necessarily talking about what we consider to be music making, but also listening, you know? &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;The act of listening is also making music. So you could be in the wild without any musical instrument and you’d be hearing the birds and the waterfall or whatever, and it would be music to your ears.&lt;/span&gt; Just the act of listening turns it into music. So somehow that’s–in simple words, it’s kind of like one of the energizing factors in this world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Now as I mentioned, this site is for helping people to discover new kinds of music and new artists. You are the first ambient artist–well actually, &lt;a href=&quot;/interview/michael-manring&quot;&gt;Michael Manring&lt;/a&gt; does ambient as well. But I’d like to ask you specifically about ambient music because you obviously have a lot of deep opinions and thoughts on music and its capabilities. So can you–what turned you onto ambient music and can you describe how ambient music reaches you in a way that’s similar to or different to non-ambient music, you know–more standard radio music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/aXwoo2Gzl-s?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Well, first of all, I would say that for me, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;what sounds like ambient music to other people, it’s just one particular kind of contemporary music in the sense that it’s more concerned with the music than the marketing or the packaging. It’s more like classical music than pop music in that sense.&lt;/span&gt; The cool thing about ambient music is that it–even though when &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Eno&quot;&gt;Brian Eno &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; coined the term, the idea was for it to be like a passive listening thing. But with modern–or I’ll just say post modern ambient music, it’s really music that people actively listen to, you know? You can do anything with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s just up to you. It’s not really printed into the music what you can do with it. So ambient music in that sense is really speaking of that: the emotional content of the music. What we’d describe as ambient music has the potential to be about a pure–or more of a pure expression of an emotion. When I say expression, I don’t mean that it’s an emotion that you as the creator have, but the emotion that the listener can kind of compose around the sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s interesting because it’s really all sort of technology that brought me into ambient music because I started using delay loops pretty early on when they became available in the mid-90s when the Oberheim Echoplex Digital Pro–that’s the device that I used to record my first album, actually. It’s kind of like a microcosm. You’re zooming into sounds. You’re zooming into harmonic structures. You’re allowed to take your time and that’s what really makes this such an amazing genre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Also, for personal development. I think I did it in order to practice making music. Like, the delay loops to play into it. You’re hearing back to what you just played right away and then you can add something. You learn about the spacing of the notes. You learn about the spacing in time, the spacing in the spectrum and all like that. It was really just fascinating and inspiring for me to have technology available that allowed me to compose in real-time that way. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;So I still do that when I’m making ambient music. It’s always an expression. It’s like real-time composition. It’s not improvisation. It’s real-time composition and I can apply similar concepts to the composition to doing it “offline.””&lt;/span&gt; But the live composition has always been a very important factor. Really, ambient music lends itself to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: What first attracted you to ambient music and did it strike you as appealing at first?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Very much so. I think the first music that I would describe as “ambient music” that I heard was also was by Mike Oldfield from an album called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Killing_Fields_(album)&quot;&gt;The Killing Fields &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. A soundtrack album and there were just these really short ambient pieces on there. Just maybe a minute or so of really, really weird chords and those fascinated me a lot. It was just this… just the mood to have the sustained sound and you could just kind of zoom in onto the relationships of the notes with each other and it was like a whole world was opening up in just the combination of those static pitches and that’s really what was fascinating for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bc4KWsxoBYI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Around the same time, I got into contemporary classical composers of the 20th century, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivier_Messiaen&quot;&gt;Messiaen &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and also &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bedford&quot;&gt;David Betford &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for example, who is really amazing. Those guys were always doing ambient music but what kind of set it apart and what kind of drew me in I guess was that they were always breaking the boundaries of what people considered to be consonant versus dissonant. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;And really that’s where my interest always was, to teach myself to hear things. To not even fall into this category of saying, “This is dissonant and this is consonant.” I’m still kind of in the process of breaking that barrier for myself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s very relevant for an instrumentalist if you’re playing like me. I’m performing and I do not want to cringe when I play a “wrong” note and I’ve been working on that for almost 20 years and I’ve gotten very good at it. I can play any wrong note at any time. It might sound very bad to you but to me it sounds great. That was really one of the aims, I think the looping technology, the ambient music was one of the ways how I could accomplish that for myself, how I could practice that for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: That kind of raises another very amateur question that I wrote down. I enjoy ambient music, but I only have been exposed to what I would say are professionals, you know? &lt;em&gt;laughs&lt;/em&gt; You, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Fripp&quot;&gt;Robert Fripp &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Brian Eno, Michael Manring, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Hedges&quot;&gt;Michael Hedges &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Is there &lt;strong&gt;bad&lt;/strong&gt; ambient music? How would you know if it was bad, if there’s such a thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Dude, there’s no bad music. There’s either music or it’s not music. You’re the one who defines that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Alright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Just this idea of a “guilty pleasure,” which exists in the English language, yeah? The guilty pleasure–doesn’t makes sense to me. Like, you know, whatever floats your boat. Really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: That’s cool! You said in another interview where you found your voice at the age of 33. Can you–as somebody who has gone too far in the world of technique and instrumental noodling–can you tell me about how you found your voice and the path you kind of took? Because for me, I feel like I need to get a step away from some of that. We both did guitar craft stuff. For me it’s almost taken me too far into the technical direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Mm hmm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: But I wanted to hear about your side of things and how you found your voice in the path you took and the path that you’re on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: OK. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;So just this concept of your personal voice, I really–I wouldn’t use those words, because it’s not my voice. It really isn’t, because I’d rather consider myself to be like an interface, ok?&lt;/span&gt; So the voice is between whatever is there to inspire and the recipient. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I’m part of the audience, you know. When I’m playing, I’m listening. That’s really actually maybe the wisest thing I can say or you could say to any musician: listen to what you’re playing or what you’re doing&lt;/span&gt;, right? I don’t ever question that, but probably it’s something that people just don’t do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zaF46p-Z8tU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So I think that’s like &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;if you want to find your own voice, just listen to what you’re doing.&lt;/span&gt; I guess that’s the answer. You know, and it really connects to the question you had earlier, like with looping devices. That’s what they do, you know? You play into them and it plays back to you right away, so you’re hearing what you did and you have the opportunity to decide for yourself if you, let’s say like it, or not like it. Or even if you don’t want to use those terms, how you would describe what’s happening?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Maybe you play 3 notes, and then you realize, “Oh the second note, that was a D. The D had a little bit of a buzz on it.” Then you decide for yourself whether the buzz is something you want the next time you play the D or no, or maybe you don’t want the buzz. Or maybe the D didn’t really satisfy you, so next time you’d play an E-flat. Really that’s how we kind of find our voice, just by playing things back to ourselves and that could be like, you could sit down with the instrument, start the recorder, and just improvise, just play, just move your fingers, don’t even improvise, just move your fingers and then listen back to it, and then repeat. That’s how you can find your voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Did you overcome–you said you avoided cringing or you’re learning to avoid cringing when you’re playing a “wrong note.” Did you have to overcome fears to get to where you are, to create the music that you create, even to become a musician?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Yeah, very much so, but in a way I got lucky that my personality is like that I’m very um… well, I don’t know how to put it. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Some people think that I’m arrogant. But it’s not that I’m arrogant, I just have this vision, I kind of know what is right and what is wrong&lt;/span&gt;, even if it’s in the greater context, what I consider is right is wrong, I don’t care, but &lt;strong&gt;at least I have an opinion&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I’m good at creating references and milestones for myself and that’s really what, at least that’s my path of developing of improving, you know. For example with the touch guitar, with a touch-style instrument. When I started out in the early 90s, people were saying, “Oh we don’t know anything about it… blah blah blah. Nobody knows how to play this instrument, blah blah blah blah blah.” And I said, “&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Ok yeah we don’t know how to play this instrument but we know what we need in order to play what we consider music. We need to be able to start a note and we need to be able to stop a note.&lt;/span&gt; We can look at the instrument and find out how to start a note and how to stop a note. That’s what we can do.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;That’s what I was always very good at, identifying what we know, or what I know, and then I could go from there. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;That’s really one of the secrets: to not get distracted by what you don’t know but to start at a point where you feel confident that something’s right.&lt;/span&gt; Even that, if that thing is right to you is wrong in the bigger context, it’s still is something that pushes you forward, because you’re not criticizing yourself. You’re not kind of putting your hands into cuffs before you’ve even started playing a note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: This kind of approach, I’d imagine, requires a very supportive audience. And thankfully for the internet, there’s an international community that’s open to this kind of music. Do you think that you could have done what you do and make a living 20 years ago approaching music in this sense where you are?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: I started around 20 years ago, so…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/AQKv49exnQI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: So the answer is “yes” I think. For me, it doesn’t really matter. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I don’t really assume there is an audience. I don’t assume that people want to hear what I’m doing. I think that’s just wrong.&lt;/span&gt; I can get excited about something that I create and then maybe somebody else gets excited about it. But he group of people that is really getting excited about it is either extremely small, which is fine, because you know, it could be one person. It could just be me, that one person. Fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s not about quantity for me. It’s the quality. I believe that the whole–all the talk about music business, the new paradigm and stuff–really what it is for me is that quantity doesn’t count anymore. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;It’s the quality of the connection with the fans of the artist. The fans are your audience. I would even call them “friends.”&lt;/span&gt; If for example, I can put out a free download and maybe there’s one guy who really likes what I do and he puts in 100 Euros for a download of an album, so these 100 Euros do not represent the value of a CD or a physical product you would press, but it represents the trust in the artist that somebody really likes it, there’s nothing you can quantify there anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s about quality and this is where things kind of start happening, like for example, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I would have to sell 100 downloads of a 1 Euro song to get 100 Euros. That’s not going to happen. It’s much more likely that there’s 1 person that’s going to give me 100 Euros, and that for me is the new paradigm.&lt;/span&gt; That’s how it should be and that’s how it always was. It’s just a little detour we’ve made with the “music business.” The music business is just one example of this Greek mythology thing with the demons and the gods, where the demons are trying to keep the gods stupid and naïve, stuff like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So in a way that’s really like where we’re… well when I say “we,” I’m obviously talking about myself. Fortunately I’m at a different… I really don’t… I couldn’t be bothered without selling copies of something. I don’t care. It’s not what motivates, also. It’s different, I mean &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/notes/steven-wilson/steven-wilson-talks-streaming/1160792253941035&quot;&gt;I read an interview &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Wilson&quot;&gt;Steven Wilson &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a few weeks ago, which actually was not an interview, but an advertorial. Anyway, people were discussing it online as if it was a real interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I read the same thing. &lt;em&gt;laughs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: There was one point at which Steven said that he would rather have stuff out on Spotify so people could listen to it and I think that clearly, and I’m–this is not like criticism of this person, I’m saying &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;it shows what his motivation is. His motivation is that he wants people to hear what he’s doing. That’s fine. That’s something a lot of us need. That would kill the music for me. I don’t want to do that.&lt;/span&gt; It’s really interesting that the less compromise I make for project, the more successful the project… it’s totally counterintuitive, but it’s true and it’s kind of interesting because I love collaborating with people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So for example, and here’s an interesting story. My friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Boddy&quot;&gt;Ian Boddy &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that I started working with in 1999, so a long time ago. Whenever we put out an album, we switched the names around so it could be Ian Boddy + Markus Reuter or the other way around. You’d assume that if you have two groups of fans intersecting, you would, I mean, or being added to each other, you would get a bigger audience. But the opposite is true. When Ian releases a solo album, he sells more, you know? And the other way around. It’s really interesting how the psychology also plays into the image that people have over certain artists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/DJdqd4DAy-U?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Also the protectiveness and preciousness about a certain artist. It’s interesting how these things go that like at some point, a name becomes the music in a way. It’s not about the music anymore. You have to like it. Because people say so, because the media says so, and I don’t have a problem with that because it’s cool and it helps and I mean I can tour with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Levin&quot;&gt;Tony Levin &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, because the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/So_(album)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;So&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; album with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Gabriel_discography&quot;&gt;Peter Gabriel &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was so successful in the 80s and without all the money they spent on it, I wouldn’t be where I am!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But still, it’s just really something that you need to be aware of these days that a lot of things that you read, or most of the things that you read, are just paid-for content and paid-for opinion and it doesn’t mean anything. That’s just the way it is. Some of us–maybe we have a sense of that and understand that you would always have to read between the lines and stuff. So anyway, there’s no need for me to get into that world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: You must be a great music producer. I know you produce a lot of artists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Why? I would say as somebody who manages people as my full-time work, what pays me in the market, I see a man with a very strong vision, a way to articulate that, a way to use that vision and motivate other people. Even just hearing you myself here and now, I feel like, “Yeah! I need to get up and make music and quit worrying about the things I worry about! I need to put those fears behind me.” How do you bring that out in the artists you work with, especially if they see things pretty differently, or that they have an agent that doesn’t agree with your philosophies here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: It’s really a struggle, always, for me. It’s really difficult to say how it works, but &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;one way of describing it is that I do need to &lt;strong&gt;make&lt;/strong&gt; people deconstruct what they’re doing and then reconstruct it, and even if what they reconstruct is exactly the same thing that they had before they deconstructed it, they have more awareness of what it is.&lt;/span&gt; So for example, there was a band that I produced 6-7 years ago, where they didn’t have any transitions between the sections of the songs and we worked on all the transitions in the rehearsal room. Then for the recording, we dropped half of the transitions and went back to just to the A-B thing. But the way that those transitions felt at that point was completely different because not having a transition IS a transition, but it’s only a transition if you are aware that you haven’t considered that there could be a transition. Know what I’m saying?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s about awareness, with deconstruction you’re looking at all the elements–you’re kind of assigning meaning to things, and then you put the puzzle back together. For example, if you have a puzzle of New York City, like 3000 pieces, and you just look at it–that’s New York City. But then you take all the pieces apart and you look at each one and say, “OK that’s the top of the Chrysler Building. That’s blah-blah-blah,” and then you put it back together. That’s a real piece of art then–and that’s how I produce. So the result could be exactly same thing that goes in, but it’s not the same thing. It’s completely charged up with meaning and emotion and… intention–that’s the word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I would imagine that there’s a good sense of fulfillment for you as a producer, especially when you can bring that out in the art or the artist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/GjG5R8FzJYE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Yes, but I have to say, it’s really the most frustrating job, you know? Because with some artists, it’s just so difficult to get them to really look at what they’re doing and to reevaluate what they’re doing. Even something like there’s a performance that isn’t good but it &lt;strong&gt;has&lt;/strong&gt; to be that performance because “I have to play the guitar part.” It can’t be the studio musician, it can’t be the guy who can actually play guitar. “It has to be me,” and the… again here’s a big difference. Usually I encourage them to play the stuff themselves, but &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;if your vision as an artist goes beyond what you’re capable of, I would rather collaborate with somebody to find the best realization of that vision rather than trying to do everything myself&lt;/span&gt;, you know? There are people capable of doing that. but there are others who are not really capable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So the struggle with the artist is usually to get them to let go. When I say “let go,” it’s not to let go of an idea at all, but just to let go of an emotional attachment to a specific detail in the music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: There is a phrase in writing called, “Murder your darlings.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Mm hmm. Never heard that before, but makes sense, yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yeah, that’s so interesting. OK can I get to these burning questions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Sure. The burning questions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yes. Let’s see… [These are questions from Bernie Quiroga, a Markus Reuter insider] “I understand some material that you brought to the same &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stick_Men_%28prog_band%29&quot;&gt;Stick Men &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sessions have been written first for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ProjeKct&quot;&gt;(The) Crimson ProjeKCt &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but that was not released as Crimson ProjeKCt, so can you tell us a little about what happened there?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Well, that’s really inside information there. Actually that particular piece didn’t make it to the Stick Men record, so it’s still out there. It’s still in my computer waiting to be played by 6 people, and it has to involve &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Belew&quot;&gt;Adrian Belew &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; because I did something very cheeky. You know, being in the inner circle of King Crimson, I got to listen to material that has never been released. So there was something that they played during a 2004 rehearsal, which was the year after the last incarnation of the band disbanded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So there was one little riff that they played, this little piece, which is just really one riff, but they didn’t take it anywhere and it didn’t come out, and they didn’t like it at all. I just felt inspired to write a piece around the riff and I did it, and that was when The Crimson ProjeKCt was active and it was just the idea to have something that Adrian would like, because it was based on his riff, but I never sent it to him. He’s never heard it. Pat and Tony have heard it and loved it, but when we tried to massage it for this Stick Men album, it turned out that Adrian’s riff is defining the piece so much that we couldn’t replace it. It just didn’t work and I just didn’t want to waste a good piece, you know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: According to the vision, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Yes, yes, exactly. So that’s that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: OK, I’ll do one more here. “Why do you feel that &lt;em&gt;Face&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.markusreuter.com/discography/tuner/&quot;&gt;Tuner &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Falling for Ascension&lt;/em&gt; are two albums you won’t release, even though you’re very proud of them?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: You know, I’m in a position where I’ve dedicated my whole life into making music. That means I’m also dedicating, well not necessarily 24x7, but maybe 19x7 hours to making music.
&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;You know, people call me Markus, the guy that never sleeps or something, which isn’t true. I do sleep. But when you go to work, yeah, I make music.&lt;/span&gt;So I have like maybe somebody that writes 32 emails per day. Ok, I can write 2 pieces per day, or I can record 5 hours of music each day. I don’t do that at all because that doesn’t make sense, which I’m going to explain now, but really, I just make music all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So there’s just too much material and I don’t have enough support outside of my own self to really put out music, and even the Stick Men record–even though we had an offer for the upcoming Stick Men record &lt;em&gt;Prog Noir&lt;/em&gt;, we had an offer from a label, which just–Tony didn’t like the deal at all, so we didn’t do it, which means it ends up in my hands. In “our” hands, which means my hands. I have to be the product manager. I have to be the label, and put it out out. It’s just so frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I mean, I have kind of given in and I do these things, but it means that &lt;em&gt;Face&lt;/em&gt;, for example, which is probably, I mean… it’s kind of funny to say, but I think that the best work I’ve done is not yet out there, yeah? I mean some of it is already completed and obviously a lot more is there, but I’ve just come to the point where, what I was saying before. Like other people say he wants people to hear his music and I just say, “No, I’m not going to pay the price to put these things out just for like 5 people to hear it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Because even though I said that I’m more about the quality, yes, which means that before I put something out I have to ask myself, “Do I want to invest the time, do I invest myself with putting it out?” I have to look at the quality of life I’d be giving myself. So that even before I consider the quality of the music or the quality of the interaction with a friend or fan, I have to say, “How well am I with that? Am I doing something good for myself?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;At this point it’s just difficult to put out &lt;em&gt;Face&lt;/em&gt;. There’s not enough behind it to really put it out there, and &lt;em&gt;Falling for Ascension&lt;/em&gt;–I’m talking with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nik_Bärtsch&quot;&gt;Nik Bärtsch &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who’s a friend of mine, and his label &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.roninrhythmrecords.com&quot;&gt;Ronin Rhythm Records &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, to put it out, but it seems like he’s also not 100% convinced of the album. I don’t know… so it’s always.. there’s always something that kind of derails these projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: That’s great. Thank you for these very thoughtful and detailed answers. I really appreciate you going through all of this. I feel like there’s a least another hour’s conversation in here, but I have to get to a sales meeting in 20 minutes, so… &lt;em&gt;laughs&lt;/em&gt;. But thank you so much for your time. I really appreciate it, Markus.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Michael Manring Concert</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;concert-trailer&quot;&gt;CONCERT TRAILER&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/hB6-ZtZh-pc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m so excited about this, I don’t even know what to say! I’ll let this trailer speak for itself. In case you couldn’t tell, this concert is available for purchase via YouTube for $20. Michael gets a large share of the revenue and MWM keeps a little so we can keep making this kind of content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ad&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He96CHvohyk&quot;&gt;Purchase this concert on YouTube.&amp;nbsp;&lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;A majority of the revenue goes to Michael.&lt;/em&gt; :)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of free footage below! Read on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;special-thanks&quot;&gt;SPECIAL THANKS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much to Ken Coffman from &lt;a href=&quot;http://stairwaypress.com/&quot;&gt;Stairway Press &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for sponsoring this concert!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thanks so much to &lt;a href=&quot;http://michaelnitro.com&quot;&gt;Michael Nitro &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for his lighting crew and equipment. He’s a huge reason the concert looks so great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thanks so much to &lt;a href=&quot;/interview/andy-west&quot;&gt;Andy West&lt;/a&gt; for lending us all his gear so we could do this concert. And for helping to move furniture out of my living and dining rooms (along with another good friend, &lt;a href=&quot;http://softwareplusplus.com&quot;&gt;Cory Berg &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thanks so much to the 35-40 people who attended and made this such a special event, and then donated to MWM. So many wonderful people supporting the arts and fantastic and creative music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;promo-footage&quot;&gt;PROMO FOOTAGE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael and I thought it would be cool to take a chunk of the concert and offer it for free, so here’s about 18 minutes of free footage that will hopefully entice you to purchase a copy of the rest of the concert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/BZwB7sa2o1s?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the opening improv piece, Michael’s cover of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Send_Me&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;You Send Me&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in this video is my favorite part of the concert. And his performance of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dixie_Dregs&quot;&gt;Dixie Dregs &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;’ &lt;em&gt;What If&lt;/em&gt; with the Dregs’ own Andy West is a real treat!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-context&quot;&gt;Some Context&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in the early 2000s, my friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://damprabbit.com&quot;&gt;Bob Mendelsohn &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; posted some videos of Michael playing at NAMM and I just fell in love with Michael’s playing. I signed up for his mailing list and waited anxiously for him to come to Phoenix, AZ to perform. In 16 years, he never did! So, &lt;a href=&quot;/interview/michael-manring&quot;&gt;when I interviewed him&lt;/a&gt;, I asked him if he’d ever be up for a house concert. He said he would and I resolved to find a way to fly him out and perform at my house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ualQv5bOwsM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So on Saturday, April 23, 2016, I had around 40 friends come over for a private event where we all sat in awe watching Michael work his magic up close and personal. And he hung out for a while afterward signing stuff for people and taking pictures. It was a real dream come true. That and &lt;a href=&quot;http://alovelettertofood.com&quot;&gt;my wife &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; catered the whole thing, which made it delicious for the ears as well as the tummy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hosting this house concert was a dream come true and Ken Coffman made it all possible financially. I am deeply indebted to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you really enjoy this concert because I have another concert planned in November with another special guest!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;special-thanks&quot;&gt;SPECIAL THANKS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much to Julie Cord from &lt;a href=&quot;http://bluemouthpromotions.com/&quot;&gt;Blue Mouth Promotions &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for setting me up with this interview! She and her brother manage a whole bunch of great artists at BMP. Check them out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also special thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://lucasleemusic.com&quot;&gt;Lucas Lee &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for doing the transcription of this interview! I love that people want to help with the work of this site. Thank you, Lucas!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-context&quot;&gt;Some Context&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d never heard of Teddy Kumpel before Julie recommended I interview him. Once I asked some Facebook friends about him, several chimed in saying they loved what he did. I spent a few hours checking out his incredible and exhaustive YouTube channel featuring his Loopestra, which (as you’ll soon find out) is a band with rotating members that perform different arrangements of songs every time Teddy books a gig. It’s incredibly creative and I can’t even imagine how challenging it must be for Teddy and his compatriots. The only experience I have with this is playing at church, where I never am playing with the same people, but the music isn’t typically challenging or terribly diverse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://teddyjam.com&quot;&gt;Don’t know who Teddy Kumpel is? Check out his website! &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I checked out Teddy and learned more about him, I knew he’d be a great candidate for an MWM interview. Thanks so much to Teddy for letting me spend time with him during a practice day at the beginning of his 2016 tour with Joe Jackson in Scottsdale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interview-transcript&quot;&gt;Interview transcript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Hi this is Anthony from MakeWeirdMusic.com and I am here with &lt;a href=&quot;http://teddyjam.com&quot;&gt;Teddy Kumpel &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, guitarist for &lt;a href=&quot;http://joejackson.com/&quot;&gt;Joe Jackson &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and man of many musical adventures.
Teddy, can you tell us about yourself, and your formation as a musician?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: My formation, yes… Okay, here it goes. I was born on Long Island, New York. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;My father was a mathematician and my mom was a church organist&lt;/span&gt;. My father played &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_(Manhattan)&quot;&gt;Broadway &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show_tune&quot;&gt;show tunes &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;When I was a kid, we sang and played a lot. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;My mom played tons of classical music and also &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragtime&quot;&gt;rags &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. She loved &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Joplin&quot;&gt;Scott Joplin &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and super early jazz stuff, so I was definitely informed by that.&lt;/span&gt; I think by the time I got to be maybe in third grade, I was already playing guitar. We should start with guitar, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I was already playing guitar by maybe 3? I was probably playing &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukulele&quot;&gt;ukulele &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and both my parents were in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbershop_quartet&quot;&gt;barbershop quartets &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Wow! That’s pretty cool!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Yeah, so my sister and I would learn harmonies to the barbershop quartets and sing with my parents in the car when driving somewhere. We’d learn how to sing background harmonies at a very young age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Ukulele, barbershop quartet - that’s the early years. Let’s see… Then we move up to the 3rd grade. So, school band, playing saxophone… I didn’t grow up wealthy or anything, so my summer camp was going to summer school at the local elementary school. This was in the 70s…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And my music teacher, Claire Kahn, was super cool, and since I didn’t really know if I liked the saxophone as I was into the ukulele more,
I said, “Hey, I want to try the tuba.” She was like, “Yeah, sure, try the tuba! Take that home!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;She let me take home every band instrument one summer and I tried the viola, cello, tuba, trombone… everything you can think of.&lt;/span&gt; French horn, trumpet–I just took them home and messed around with them and &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I think that kind of informed my guitar playing because just the willingness to go in many different places and try things and make different sounds other than guitar sounds was part of my upbringing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And then I played in concert bands from 3rd grade until I was a senior, and I played all different instruments. I played baritone horn, tuba, trombone, saxophone… all that stuff, and then also played guitar in the jazz band.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I had an excellent guitar teacher when I was a kid. This guy–&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stonybrookmusic.com/richard_rabatin.html&quot;&gt;Richard Rabatin &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; who was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://berklee.edu&quot;&gt;Berklee &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; composition major–taught me. I guess he recognized when I was like 14 when I started with him that I had a pretty good ear. So he started me on atonal sight-singing right away, which he apologizes for now. Hi Rich! [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;That really opened up my ears I think at a young age and he showed me a lot of stuff that I don’t think any other teacher would have gone there with such a young kid.&lt;/span&gt; Yeah. So… There you go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Did you play piano at all with your mother’s influence or anything?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: My mom was so good at piano that when I watched her play, I was like, “Um, I’ll never be able to do that. I’m sticking with guitar.” [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: You obviously were passionate enough about guitar to go to Berkelee College of Music, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: I didn’t go to Berkelee College of Music. I got a scholarship to go there and I decided that I’d rather go to University of Miami, so I went there and that was really great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;In my freshman year there, my roommate was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.andytimmons.com/&quot;&gt;Andy Timmons &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I had a bunch of great guitar players around me: &lt;a href=&quot;http://brianmonroney.com&quot;&gt;Brian Monroney &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.du.edu/ahss/lamont/faculty-staff/faculty/abbott-mike.html&quot;&gt;Mike Abbott &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.timmitchellmusic.com&quot;&gt;Tim Mitchell &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://shakira.com&quot;&gt;Shakira’s &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; musical director. We were all in it together and started teaching each other stuff as we went along, and it was really great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: What did you focus on as part of your guitar instruction?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: I think the first couple of years in Miami were sort of an eye opener for me, because it showed me how much Richard, my teacher in high school, showed me. I placed out of all the theory classes and I didn’t have to take any of them, but also I realized that I didn’t know a lot of things on the guitar that a lot of other people knew, so it was all about learning all your chord voicings, learning tunes, jazz tunes, and transcribing. It was the Studio Music and Jazz Program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Where did you go from there, once you graduated? What were some of your early opportunities as a musician?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Well, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;while I was in college, I was playing 6 nights a week playing &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_40&quot;&gt;Top 40 music &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to get myself through it. So, 6 nights a week, 6 sets a night.&lt;/span&gt; That was Miami in the 80s. South Florida in the 80s. That’s the thing–you could just play and play and play. You’d join bands and make a couple dollars. And the main thing about that was that you’d be learning tunes constantly, because you had to know whatever was on the radio. And it would get your stamina up. You’d have to play so long every night that if you can’t stand on the stage for that long, if you got tired or didn’t give it your 100%… [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: How long did you do that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: That was probably a good 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Brutal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: You must have burned through strings. It’s humid in Miami, playing 6 nights a week too…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Yeah, true, true, true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: 6 sets?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: 6 sets a night…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Oh my goodness…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Yeah…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Dance Clubs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: It started like 8 o’clock at night and ended like 2 or 3 in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Wow, and you never traveled? You just stayed in Miami doing these clubs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: I was sort of like up and down the coast of Florida. I think the farthest north we went was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Palm_Beach,_Florida&quot;&gt;West Palm Beach &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but we would also go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_Largo,_Florida&quot;&gt;Key Largo &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for a month. If you weren’t in school at the time you could go do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: How long were you in Florida?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/H_gNrf6-5uA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: About 5 years. I took a gig with this band &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_Silk&quot;&gt;Rare Silk &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. They were like the weird &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Manhattan_Transfer&quot;&gt;Manhattan Transfer &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. They got a Grammy nomination, and they were really a creative band. I toured with them with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ric_Fierabracci&quot;&gt;Ric Fierabracci&lt;/a&gt; on bass and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.umdrums.com/2015/08/16/olbin-burgos/&quot;&gt;Olbin Burgos &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who played drums for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesoundmachine.net&quot;&gt;Miami Sound Machine &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for a long time
and this amazing producer from Miami, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_Mendez&quot;&gt;Lester Mendez &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; playing keyboard. We were their band, and we toured for about a year, then we all quit. [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Something happened?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: I think we wanted more money and they wouldn’t give us more money, something like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: And when was this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: It was about 1986.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: What’s been going on, you know after that, since then?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: After that, I moved to New York, and did what every young starving musician does in New York in the 80s. At least there were only a few things that you could do to make money and one of the main ones was doing club dates or weddings. So &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I think between 1988 and 1998, I did about probably 750 weddings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Oh my goodness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: You were probably really good at wedding music by then after the Miami dance scene, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Well, Miami pop music/dance scene was sort of like what’s on the radio, and wedding was in NY are a very specific thing. You’ve got to know your &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Sinatra&quot;&gt;Frank Sinatra &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you’ve got to know a couple of standards, some &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bossa_nova&quot;&gt;Bossa Novas &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you have &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antônio_Carlos_Jobim&quot;&gt;Jobim &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you’ve got to know…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Maybe there’s a set of dance music, maybe there’s a set of oldies dance music like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sly_and_the_Family_Stone&quot;&gt;Sly and the Family Stone &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. So it’s very diverse and &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;you meet a lot of really great players when you do weddings in New York because everybody does them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;If you’re not a producer, or if you’re a musician and you’re only a side man and that’s your job, then you’re gonna probably going to end up in a wedding gig at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yeah, it’s funny &lt;a href=&quot;/interview/andy-west&quot;&gt;Andy West&lt;/a&gt; was in a band called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.andywest.com/music/recordings/fwap2.html&quot;&gt;Fwap &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with a guitarist named &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.joaquinmusic.com/&quot;&gt;Joaquin Levano &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in New York, and my dad recently moved back to NY. He’s been playing and he met Joaquin through the keyboard player that my dad has known for a long time, and Joaquin and Scott [keyboardist] were playing weddings in New York! So that’s just funny talking to my dad. “You know, you’ve got this guitarist named Joaquin Levano” Like, what? He played with Andy West! And my dad played and I with Andy West shortly in Arizona, so…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Oh yeah? Cool. Andy’s super cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yeah. Everyone plays weddings in New York!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So what about your own compositions like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/teddykumpel&quot;&gt;Loopestra&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/PDnftXsCwsQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Yeah, it’s my own music. Composition-wise, started composing, and I would say when I was in high school I was writing instrumental rock tunes. Then in Miami, I started writing a lot more, branching out, writing lyrics, and putting together little productions of things on a 4-track recorder, trying to figure out how to do that. Then I had a band in the early 90s called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/nomesane&quot;&gt;Nome Sane? &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;http://tonyscherr.com/&quot;&gt;Tony Scherr &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who’s the bass player for &lt;a href=&quot;http://billfrisell.com&quot;&gt;Bill Frisell &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.andymiddleton.com/&quot;&gt;Andy Middleton &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who’s an amazing sax player, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.briandunnedrums.com/&quot;&gt;Brian Dunne &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; who’s the drummer for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hallandoates.com/&quot;&gt;Hall and Oates &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Oh wow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: We had a funk band. That was pretty fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Nome Sane?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Nome Sane? &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/nome-sane/id46625193&quot;&gt;You can find that on iTunes &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Oh cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: It has a question mark at the end. Nome Sane, question mark. We did some touring. We played in Europe. We had a really good time and I think &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I learned a lot about being a bandleader from doing that for four strong personalities&lt;/span&gt;, trying to figure that out. It’s good and then as time went on, people kind of drifted off and we disbanded and I started writing a lot of pop songs. So I wrote a lot of pop songs with some artists who got signed and I got a publishing deal with EMI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Oh cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Um.. which, you know, that and $2.50 will get you on a subway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Great, Right! Yeah. [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: So &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I have a lot of experience demoing and writing pop songs and I guess that does inform my weird music making too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yeah I bet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Because &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I know how to craft something into something that’s listenable but I also like weird things, so I like to marry those two things together.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Who are some of the weird influences that you’ve got?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4tKq1kc1RKk?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Oh man, well weird influences–let’s see. That’s a good question. I listened to a lot of early &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rambler_%28Bill_Frisell_album%29&quot;&gt;Bill Frisell - Rambler &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That album where they had 2 brass instruments. He had &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Wheeler&quot;&gt;Kenny Wheeler &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on flugelhorn and he had tuba player and he had electric bass and him and the drummer so like… high and low strings and high and low brass and a drummer. I like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And I listen to a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Garbarek&quot;&gt;Jan Garbarek &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He’s a Norwegian sax player who sounds like he’s playing in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fjord&quot;&gt;Fjords &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;–lot of reverb and &lt;em&gt;makes sounds&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I listen to a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://adrianbelew.net/&quot;&gt;Adrian Belew &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zappa.com/&quot;&gt;Zappa &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a lot of contemporary weird classical music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Like minimalist? Like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.philipglass.com/&quot;&gt;Phillip Glass &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stevereich.com/&quot;&gt;Steve Reich &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: No, I’m more into the harmonic stuff, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Satie&quot;&gt;(Erik) Satie &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parade_%28ballet%29&quot;&gt;Parade &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Yeah. And guitar-wise, I’m into all the typical sort of influences that everybody has I guess &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimi_Hendrix&quot;&gt;Hendrix &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Beck&quot;&gt;Jeff Beck &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Page&quot;&gt;Jimmy Page &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: &lt;em&gt;Eh.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I don’t meet many musicians who’d do that with Jimmy Page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Jimmy Page… I mean I love &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Led_Zeppelin&quot;&gt;Led Zeppelin &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I’m not like the guy who listen to Led Zeppelin and goes “Wow! I want to play all those guitar licks,” you know? But, I played them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Of course. 6 nights a week…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Well I had my band in 8th grade and we played all that stuff. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pinkfloyd.com&quot;&gt;Pink Floyd &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, then later on I listen to a lot of Frisell, and a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.johnscofield.com/&quot;&gt;John Scofield &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and that’s about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I just saw Scofield with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bradmehldau.com/&quot;&gt;Brad Mehldau &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://markguiliana.com/&quot;&gt;Mark Guiliana &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Oh Yeah?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Awesome show in New York.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Yeah. I love Mark. Mark has done the Loopestra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z4l0QmP8cks?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: That’s right! Yeah, I wanted to ask you about that. So the Loopestra–how did that get started? Did you first with the electronics, and get an idea, or…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Loopestra kind of came about because &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I wanted to have a band where I could write open ended songs that didn’t have a lot of changes and I wanted to get another guitar player who would just play rhythm and I could make weird noises over that and sing songs, but I couldn’t find anybody who would just play rhythm.&lt;/span&gt; Everybody wanted to have other roles and as great as that could have been, it wasn’t what I wanted to do. And right about that time, Boss came out with a looper. [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: So I was like, “Well, sorry dude, you’re fired. I’m getting a looper!” and it turns out that worked well for me. I was able to exercise my production brain live with that, which isn’t to say that I do a lot of electronics stuff because sometimes it’s very organic and basic. Sometimes I can make it sound like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jamesbrown.com/&quot;&gt;James Brown &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes I can be totally bizarre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: How did you get in touch with the roster of people you’ve played with? Is just the years of working as a musician playing gigs that you’ve built that network? Or are you seeking out these people for specific sounds or talents?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: I think it started out–I wanted to have a set band when I started that, and then it’s New York city. Sometimes people can’t make $50 gigs, so I had to start mixing it up and then that became a thing. It became interesting to have a different drummer and bass player on the gig every time, because you’re making loops–and it’s not a lot of changes and there’s no rehearsal, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;so it ends up that they just had to bring their own personalities to the table and they don’t know what’s going to happen either, so it’s exciting for them. They don’t have to have any preconceived notion of what’s going to happen.&lt;/span&gt; I try to tailor what I’m doing to what I think they’re going to bring, but then sometimes they surprise me and bring in something completely different than what I thought they were going to bring, so it’s really fun for me to get to play with all these guys and mix it up with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yeah it seems less like music performance and more like musical communication between 3 or 4 people at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: You don’t play the songs for the other guys beforehand generally unless they’ve done a gig with you before? Then they’re unfamiliar with what you’re going to do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Exactly, yeah. Yeah, I think when somebody wants to know what they should check out, I say, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;“Just go check yourself out. Check out your personality, alone in your apartment and meditate a little bit or something. I don’t know what to tell you, pal.”&lt;/span&gt; [laughs] That’s a really New York answer, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Yeah, but as far as the people who have done this… You’re doing this on a Monday night in New York, where all musicians have a day off and people come out, so they see it and they want to be part of it. Or I think, “Oh you know those 2 guys played with blah-blah-blah together. Maybe it’d be cool if they did it ‘cause they have a thing together.” I try to keep people together that have “a thing.” Then sometimes you can’t get people to play together a lot, so you have to put people together that never play together, then they evolve into having “a thing” also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Is this live dynamic performance a response to anything in your past? Like playing through-composed music by other people for so much of your career as a paid musician, doing these wedding gigs, club gigs and that kind of thing? Were you just craving this kind of live improvisation? Or is that always been part of your musical…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Good question. I would say, I’ve been jamming like that with my mom since I was a kid, where she would play organ and I would play piano. Even though I don’t really know how to play piano, I have ears and fingers, so I can kind of find and play in between and we would have these epic half hour long jams that would just go from totally &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bizarro_World&quot;&gt;bizarro world &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;–but very reactionary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;She would play something, I’d answer. And she doesn’t really consider herself an improviser necessarily. She’s got great ears, but she’s a classical musician, so everything she’s drawing from is something that has been played before. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;But I had no idea what that was most of the time, so I was just sort of hearing my way through it.&lt;/span&gt; And I guess, that’s always been part of my M.O.–jamming and playing extended things as it’s always been fun for me. But equally I like the set forms too, so thankfully I get to do both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yeah! Are your sets unplanned with the Loopestra?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: I don’t even think about it. I just go on stage and sort of go, “Ok, what song do I have here? Maybe I’ll sing that song.” You know? Start something and go, “Nah, I don’t want to sing that song for this. It sounds like this other song.” Because it could go either way. I have some preconceived little loopy ideas that I do for some songs, but instead  probably a third of the time, I’ll sing something else over it, just to mix it up and push the thing into an unknown territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: We didn’t actually say what the Loopestra was! We didn’t talk about it. What IS the Loopestra and how do you tell people about it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;The Loopestra is a band that has a rotating cast and rotating guitar parts&lt;/span&gt; [laughs] via loopers. So the way it works is, you get a couple of people playing bass and drums. You get a looper, you make a loop. The drummer goes, “Oh, I know what to play with that.” He does it and then the bass player says, “Oh I don’t really like that chord. I’m going to play something totally to wrong make it into another chord.” Hopefully he’ll do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yeah. I watched one of your gigs. Most of them are on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/TeddyKumpel&quot;&gt;your Youtube channel&lt;/a&gt;. Or many of them… I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: It’s extensive, the library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: It is!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: They run screaming. [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: What’s amazing to me is, you’d play a loop and my ears think, “Oh I get it.” And then the drummer would come in and do something totally off the wall, like…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/paRYPRpUfVk?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: And it completely changes the direction of the song. Even just for 8 or 16 measures. Do you get a thrill out of that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Yeah!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: It’s not confusing for you or anything? [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;/em&gt; it’s confusing. I love it when it goes to the edge of the cliff and you really have to pay attention. It just makes you pay attention when they do that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So tell me about the edge of the cliff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Okay… well &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;if you’re playing a gig where you know everything that you’re going to play, you’re not on the edge of the cliff&lt;/span&gt;, which is fine ‘cause you have thing that you’re going to do and that’s a performance. It’s a different kind of edge of the cliff, let’s say, because there are subtleties that could come out in a live performance that don’t come up every time, but you kind of have to cover the bases of what the thing is, right? Like with Joe [Jackson], he’d have set parts, and then with Loopestra, since you have no idea what it’s going to be, basically, it forces you to listen, I guess, that’s the only way to… you’re all sort of holding hands and jumping off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I’m assuming these other musicians also enjoy being on the edge of the cliff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Some more than the others. [laughs] Yes. Some of them have gone “Was that good? I don’t even know.” When they say that, I’m like, “That means it was good.” &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;When you think you don’t know, that’s where you want to live for this gig.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I love that, oh man, that’s good… and what about audiences?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Well… that’s an interesting point, because it can get self indulgent if a drummer, let’s say, decides that he’s going to be Mr. Odd-time-weirdo-loud-non-dynamic-guy, the ladies in the audience would not be happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;However, if the drummer decides that he’s going to be Mr. Pay-attention-to-the-room, look around, see who’s holding their ears, very dynamic, super groove oriented, sometimes a little bit spicy, weird for taste, then the ladies will hang. [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Xzm0ON4iDo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: And your gigs are… I mean I watched one at the Smithtown public library. I was born in Smithtown, so it was like, “oh!”…. and my aunt  does a lot of political work there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: There you go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So it was cool, but you could tell, at least, listening, there seemed to be a lot of older women in the audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Those older women loved it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yeah?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: I think partially, because of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Pelton&quot;&gt;Shawn Pelton&lt;/a&gt;, the guy who’s playing drums with me… He’s good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: He’s great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: He’s the master at it. He knows how to make it happen. They’re eating it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: And you had no bass player. It was just the two of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Yeah, yeah. I played some bass parts in that show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So what is your… has your electronics rig kind of grown into something to support the Loopestra?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Yeah, because it’s all about sort of on-the-fly access to a wide variety of sounds. I’ve cultivated, you know of, an array of probably… I don’t know, I have never counted them, but maybe there’s 40 levels of little tidbits of information there that could be turned on and off and I’m generally a one-at-a-time kind of guy. I’m not a big fan of turning on 17 different effects at the same time and seeing what happens… I’m more of a very specific and, you know, “Let’s get a delay” &lt;em&gt;makes sounds&lt;/em&gt;, “rock guitar chord on a down beat,” “let’s get another thing”… &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;and then you just build a vocabulary within the framework. So it’s… in that respect, it’s not completely improvised, because you do have you know, when you’re speaking words, you know words and they’re going to come up in sentences, right?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yep. But you’re pretty busy. I mean, when you’re playing, it’s not just the guy playing guitar. I mean, you’re turning loops on and off, you’re changing the pitch, you’re shifting the pitch of what you’re playing. What are some of the tools of your trade in the Loopestra?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: That’s the looping aspect of it, yeah. The previous thing I talked about was the sound element, where you have a variety of sound. But for the looping aspect, I have a rig set up to go through 2 diff amps in stereo, so one thing can come out in the right and one thing can come out in the left. I’m not a fan of stereo effects necessarily, where things are like ping-ponging back and forth between 2 amps. I’m more of a fan of it sounding like a record where there’s a rhythm guitar player on the right and a bass guitar player on the left. Those things can go away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So I have a way of turning off a whole side of information. I have a way of turning off a specific loop, so I have access to making 4 loops at a time and they can all be on both sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Oh, ok. So you’re signal routing in addition to thinking about what you’re playing, in addition to thinking about what instrument your guitar’s going to be sounding like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So you’re thinking texturally, sonically, spatially…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Was that super difficult at first?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: I mean, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;it took me about 2 years to develop the rig to the point where I liked it&lt;/span&gt;. So, yeah. When I first started out, I had a Boss looper that had a guide track in it and I would experiment with it by putting the guide track through an amp, so it was sort of like a drum machine playing all the time through this amp that the drummer could hear and it was just–that had to always be there. It was annoying. So I figured, “Ok, I have to figure out a way to have a click track,” because otherwise how are you going to stay in time with the loops?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Now, that’s an interesting point, because some people would say, “Well, why don’t you just have a basic rhythm loop going to the drummer’s headphones and then he could always hear that and play along with it, right?”. Is that something that somebody would say?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Somebody would say that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: I’ve heard that many times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I believe you’re correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: So, I tried that and recorded it and listened to it and I decided that - A) I don’t always want to have the beginning of the song have rhythm guitar, sometimes I want it to be ambient.  B) When I’m in a recording session with the drummer and I’m playing funky guitar, that thing is not metronomically correct necessarily. It sounds funkier when the rhythm guitar, at least my style of it, is sort of behind the beat, or sort of messing around with the beat, or…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Kind of what &lt;a href=&quot;/interview/ben-levin&quot;&gt;Ben Levin&lt;/a&gt; was talking about where he’d find an equal amount of time and it doesn’t have to be accurate, that’s what it gives it interest?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Right, exactly. So I mean if I’m playing a reggae groove… I’m going to go “&lt;em&gt;um&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;click&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;um&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;click&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;um&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;click&lt;/em&gt;…”. I’m going to go, ““&lt;em&gt;um&lt;/em&gt; (slight delay) &lt;em&gt;click&lt;/em&gt; (shorter delay)&lt;em&gt;um&lt;/em&gt; (slight delay) &lt;em&gt;click&lt;/em&gt; (shorter delay)&lt;em&gt;um&lt;/em&gt; (shorter delay) &lt;em&gt;click&lt;/em&gt;.” Like swinging a little bit, or doing something weird with it, or play a 32nd note behind just for one of them. And the drummer knows what’s going on, because he could hear the click and me doing that against the click. So he can go “Oh, I see” right away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And these guys are pros. They’re not messing around. So they’re not going to hear that and go, “Oh no, what’s going on?” They’d hear it and go, “I see, Teddy’s being weird. Ok, cool.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: That’s interesting. So do you find that, or did you find when you’re doing the rhythmic looping in the ears… was that introducing bias into your choices while you were performing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Bias in terms of…?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Well, you might hear something and go “Oh well, that’s what I’m hearing in my hears and just going to play to that, or was that constraining you at all, in the choices you were making…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Hearing the click?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: It sounded like you had at some point kind of a rhythm or drum or something before the click.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Oh THAT thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Yeah, well with that thing, it was like a beat that would always be on, so you couldn’t turn it off and you couldn’t get away from it and it sounded really gross and it wasn’t helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: And it was always in 4/4?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: No. The Boss has many different time signatures that all sound equally terrible. They designed that thing for a guy who’s playing by himself at a Holiday Inn lobby who is going to play his Bossanova, you know, (sings) “I Just Called to Say I Love You” and he needs a Bossa beat and he’s going to play like a little guitar and solo over it and maybe he’ll loop some background vocals later in the song or something. So they design it for that. They didn’t design it for somebody who’s going to get weird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Right. You’re exploiting the tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I’m seeing a lot of people do this kind of one-man-band kind of thing and layering percussion, salt shakers, whatever, but it seems that you’re primary sticking to the guitar and your loops. Have you explored building loops in that just aren’t guitar?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: I used to play kazoo or sing some stuff into the looper. I like that. It can be fun. That makes the setup bigger, which in New York isn’t necessarily good. But sometimes I still do that. I really don’t have any interest in being a 1-man band at all, so my thinking was never along those lines and how to get good at that. I always wanted it to be bass player and drummer and guitar trio with the extra stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Do you ever, or are you inspired by any particular people doing looping?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/UXyHf_SpUUI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: The most inspiring guy to me is the guy who does this most simplest and the most one-man band, which is &lt;a href=&quot;http://reggiewatts.com&quot;&gt;Reggie Watts &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He is so good. The guy–just his feel, like how he can make something quarter notes so amazing. I’m a huge fan of him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I’m trying to get him for this site at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: He’d be great. I know his bass player really well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Oh. I’ll have to reach out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Might have to talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yeah! Did you ever try something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ableton.com/&quot;&gt;Abelton &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is built a lot around song structure, components, pieces?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: I’ve tried that and I’ve found, for me, the foot pedal thing, is more solid as a tech on a gig for me. I know a lot of people that use that live and that’s fine. But I guess something with computers and me on a stage just doesn’t work really well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It kind of makes one more thing to bring and it does open up a lot more possibilities of what you can actually do, but that doesn’t necessarily help me. I think the limitations in my rig help. I think it’s good that I can only turn off one side at a time, or, you know, it’s…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I agree. Constraints are a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Yeah, so I use an &lt;a href=&quot;http://pigtronix.com/infinity/&quot;&gt;Infinity Looper &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: What’s that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: That’s a &lt;a href=&quot;http://pigtronix.com&quot;&gt;Pigtronix &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; looper. It has stereo in and stereo out and it has reverse pitch, has undo, has many, many different functions I think probably all the same ones that Ableton has, except instead of the foot pedal. Then I use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tcelectronic.com/ditto-x4-looper/&quot;&gt;TC Electronic Ditto 4 &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, that has some kind of weird–like, you can do stutter effects &lt;em&gt;makes sounds&lt;/em&gt;. You can do tape slow down &lt;em&gt;makes sounds&lt;/em&gt; stuff. [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: That’s cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: I always like to sing the effect when I’m telling the person. Is that ok? [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yeah! Absolutely. That’s why we’re here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: This stems from a New York session that I got called for once, where my friend Joey called me up and goes (in New Yorker accent) “Hey Teddy, I need you to come down here. I need you to bring your guitar and need you to bring a (&lt;em&gt;makes sounds&lt;/em&gt;) phase shifter and I need you to bring a &lt;em&gt;makes sounds&lt;/em&gt; wah wah.” This is a phone message that I got… it was just the classic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I know so many people that talk just like that! [laughs] That’s awesome! How did you get hooked up with Joe Jackson?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Joe Jackson sent out an email to probably 20 of his ex-bandmates, or people he knew in the music business to try to find a guitar player who could sing and was good with effects. So one of them who used to play with him, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cdbaby.com/Artist/AndyEzrin&quot;&gt;Andy Ezrin &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this keyboard player guy I know from college, got the email and he sent it to me and said, “Hey, you should do this, audition for Joe!”  and I said, “Oh yeah, I love Joe!” So I sent Joe an email and 6 other people recommended me and then I got to audition for him and he was super cool and we hit it off right away! There you go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: When was this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: This was last summer, about a year ago&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Oh wow, this was pretty recent for you. You’ve been touring with him on and off from the past year?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Yeah, this is our third tour. We did a US tour in October and November and we did an European tour in the Winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Do you play with any other acts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Right now? No, I’m busy enough with Joe and…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I mean in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Oh, yeah, sure I’ve done a lot of stuff. I mean, played with &lt;a href=&quot;http://rickieleejones.com/&quot;&gt;Rickie Lee Jones &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for a month on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: That must have been fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: You know, I grew up listening to her and I think kind of learned how to sing from her. So for me, it was a really spiritual experience to be with her and sing backgrounds with her and she liked my singing. She was really nice to me about that. But then right after that she went on to do another kind of project that she had a band up in California for, so we lost touch. But, yeah, I really enjoyed playing with her. She’s great–really freaky, kind of free-spirit. I did a background vocals gig for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nin.com/&quot;&gt;Nine Inch Nails &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; once, that was pretty amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/chNPM-rUCwI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: In studio, or live?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: It was MTV Music Awards 1999. So it was at the Metropolitan Opera House and it was 6 days of rehearsal for one song and it was pretty deep, man. Trent really–he’s some detailed oriented stuff. Really amazing, and to watch him work and be control in every aspect.. lights, movement on stage, every single little detail he was into. It was very eye opening. It watched the dedication and hard work he put into it. It was pretty amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Trying to think of other people I’ve played with. I do of one-off things. I did a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today_(U.S._TV_program)&quot;&gt;Today Show &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; appearance with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feist_%28singer%29&quot;&gt;Feist &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It was pretty fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: My wife LOVES Feist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Feist is great. I knew her before she was famous too and she’s been fun to watch her to do her thing. She’s so great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yeah. We found out about her through &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kings_of_Convenience&quot;&gt;Kings of Convenience &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Do you know them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_%26_Garfunkel&quot;&gt;Simon and Garfunkel &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;-type out of Norway. She did several songs with them on their albums but no one knew who she was. Great voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Yeah, amazing. I did a lot of playing with this guy, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Brown_(Canadian_musician)&quot;&gt;Chris Brown &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who’s a Canadian producer. Actually him and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Fenner&quot;&gt;Kate Fenner &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, his song writing partner and band mate - they were in this band called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_Tabernacle_Choir&quot;&gt;Bourbon Tabernacle Choir &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the, I guess the 80s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Great name!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/2g77t_CnYM8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: That band, became &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_Social_Scene&quot;&gt;Broken Social Scene &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so Chris and Kate split off as their own thing and the rest of the people kind of went on to be involved with Broken Social Scene, which is where Feist came from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Okay, interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: So it’s like a whole Canadian contingent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: You mentioned that you sang with your family growing up. But then, focused primarily on guitar after that. But I’m sure, obviously that you sing and play guitar. Anything about your vocal development - is that something you’ve focused on particularly hard or is it just natural coming from your family?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Both, I think. I always sang when I was a kid. I was in the all-state choir. Chorus in high school, I was always singing. I never really sang pop songs until college, when I did those top-40 gigs. I sort of just learned by listening to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_Wonder&quot;&gt;Stevie Wonder &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Gabriel&quot;&gt;Peter Gabriel &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and Rickie Lee, kind of emulating my heroes. I used to always joke that my warm up was a hamburger and a cigarette for singing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;This was back in the old days. Now I think it’s just drinking a lot of water and humming a lot helps, but I don’t have any real philosophy of singing, except to… it’s sort of the same on the guitar. I’m not a… &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I studied the guitar a lot and come to realization that being yourself is the most important thing - so… doesn’t require thought to do that necessarily. It’s more like getting.. you can study a lot and get a lot of things together on the guitar, but really what you want… what I want to do is to have a direct connection between my emotions, I guess, or soul, or whatever you want to call it to the instrument. So there’s no filter between those things. Just whatever you come up with on the spot is what you’re going to do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Tell me how you developed to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: I think just doing it. I don’t know. &lt;span class=&quot;importnat&quot;&gt;I don’t think there’s any way to develop that except by–you can’t think that through. You can have that philosophy and say that’s what I’m going to do and then you do it, then realize, “Oh, it takes a lot more relaxation than sort of mind over matter kind of focus to get to that than you think it does.” You’re sort of getting into your own way, right?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Absolutely! Yeah. You study technique. You study other people’s music, but there’s no real instruction on who you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Do you feel like that you found yourself musically a long time ago, or has that been fairly recent?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: I think by the early 90s, I was fairly well in myself, yeah. I’ve learned how to do that better over the years and &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I think playing with other people and being a side man helps me find my voice within other music, which helps me find my own voice within my music too, you know. So they all kind of go hand in hand.&lt;/span&gt; There’s no real one moment when I said, “Oh yeah, now I’m who I’m supposed to be.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: I know people who’ve had that and I’m always like, “Wow.” Sometimes through drugs and I’m like, “Wow, well, I’m glad I didn’t have to do THAT to get there!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yeah, no kidding. What about relaxation? What makes you emphasize that as one of your key points?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I think when your mind is focused and relaxed, you can let more of yourself through&lt;/span&gt;, you know. You’re not uptight about what’s going to happen, or pre-thinking what’s going to happen, necessarily, even if it’s set music, if it’s something that’s pre-decided or prearranged, you’ve got to be in the moment. You can’t be thinking, “Oh, here it comes! That part… oh geez! [laughs] &lt;em&gt;makes Groan noise&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: “There it went!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Brace for it! [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: The word “weird” in Make Weird Music is more about that, like finding your voice and realizing that you’re not someone else, musically - that if you’re trying to be somebody else, then you’re not being weird. Everyone’s weird. Can you tell me your take on “weird” and why we’re here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/e1BiSGOOuR4?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Liebman&quot;&gt;Dave Liebman &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you know who that is? Saxophone player? Played with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Davis&quot;&gt;Miles Davis &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, really amazing teacher and player. I was lucky enough to sit in on one of his saxophone clinics for Dave, because I drove my friend there and he said something that blew me away. He said that there’s 3 stages… real New York guy, (&lt;em&gt;in New York accent&lt;/em&gt;,) &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;“3 stages to every musician’s career. You’ve got imitator, everybody starts out imitating - gotta do it. 2nd stage. Stylist. You became yourself within a style of music. Very good for you. 3rd stage. Innovator - nobody gets there. Couple of guys.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So like.. wow, that’s brilliant and sort of like encapsulates the whole thing, you know. I’d be happy to be myself within a style of music, whatever that style is. I guess my style is sort of incorporating a lot of styles together, which you’d like to think it makes a new style, but really it’s a bunch of things mixed together. So, it’s up to the critics to decide if it’s a new style or not, I suppose. Did I answer your question? [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Sure. Whatever [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Question shmestion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I don’t even know why I’m here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So, I really appreciate you taking the time to tell us all about yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: I appreciate you coming all the way over here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Thanks a lot Teddy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Thanks for having me! Appreciate it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Thanks man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;T: Alright! Thanks Conan!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Discover Phish</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-little-about-phish&quot;&gt;A LITTLE ABOUT PHISH&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phish is an improvisation-focused rock quartet formed in Burlington, Vermont and consisting of members &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trey_Anastasio&quot;&gt;Trey Anastasio &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (guitars, lead vocals), &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Gordon&quot;&gt;Mike Gordon &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (bass, vocals), &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Fishman&quot;&gt;Jon Fishman &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (drums, percussion, vacuum, vocals), and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_McConnell&quot;&gt;Page McConnell &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (keyboards, vocals). Their stylistically whimsical and genre-defying music includes hints of rock, jazz, country, progressive rock, folk, funk, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-so-weird&quot;&gt;WHAT’S SO WEIRD?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of Phish’s work makes use of the following weird music techniques:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Time Signatures&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Composition&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Virtuosity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Humor&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Surrealism&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Atonality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TIGxcghQzY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-i-care&quot;&gt;WHY I CARE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 1995 my musical interests were deeply rooted in the psychedelic blues of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd&quot;&gt;Pink Floyd &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the statistical density of composers like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Stravinsky&quot;&gt;Stravinsky &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravel&quot;&gt;Ravel &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/frank-zappa&quot;&gt;Zappa&lt;/a&gt;. My ears were ever searching for interesting harmonies, complex &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyrhythm&quot;&gt;polyrhythms &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atonality&quot;&gt;atonal &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consonance_and_dissonance&quot;&gt;dissonance &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; while also maintaining roots in groove oriented blues and rock. It was a crossroad in my life. I was graduating from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrash_metal&quot;&gt;thrash &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_metal&quot;&gt;death metal &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoner_rock&quot;&gt;70s stoner rock &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to more sophisticated rock music stylings. Coming from a history lightly battered in classical music sensibilities, I was lucky enough to have developed a bit of an ear for the weird and unorthodox in music and was well on my way to discovering and becoming engrossed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_rock&quot;&gt;Progressive Rock &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was about this time that a good friend and accomplice in music recommended I take a listen to a weird little band from Vermont called Phish. What struck me first was the name: Phish. I mean, why was it spelled that way? The first album I tucked into was called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junta_(album)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Junta&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; another oddity in nomenclature. Needless to say, I was right off the bat intrigued. My intrigue heightened when I learned that they had a fan newsletter called &lt;a href=&quot;http://forum.phish.net/forum/show/1303154865&quot;&gt;Doniac Schvice &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which was comprised of nonsensical stories, poems, puzzles, anecdotes, instructions and surreal art provided ‘from fish to tongue.’ I haven’t even heard the music yet and I’m having fun. This should be good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listening to &lt;em&gt;Junta&lt;/em&gt; was, for me, a pretty life changing experience. I had simply never heard any music like this (this was before I found &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatfield_and_the_North&quot;&gt;Hatfield and the North &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health&quot;&gt;National Health &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but more on that in another discovery). It was comical, cartoonish, whimsical, dark, surreal, absurdist, atonal, harmonic, virtuosic, psychedelic and rocking all at once. Until I found (and subsequently became obsessed with) Zappa, I had never heard something so bizarrely unique in rock music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/CzWqHvSkQZI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the next–well, still actually, I followed the career of this band eating up everything I could get my ears on. I got all their albums which, as it turned out, only scratched the surface of their body of work. I learned that their live shows were ever changing and that no two performances ever sounded the same as they were incredible improvisors that made a point to explore musicality at every show. Songs became ‘vehicles’ of sonic exploration and going to a Phish show typically entailed getting tickets to several concurrent shows or following the band on tour a la the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead&quot;&gt;Grateful Dead &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to hear all the different permutations of their songs via improvisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But all comparisons to the Grateful Dead aside, Phish has maintained an incredible body of work that is altogether weird, beautiful, organic, dissonant, and exploratory. As far as weird music is concerned, Phish, in my opinion, should be touted up alongside Zappa, &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/the-residents&quot;&gt;The Residents&lt;/a&gt;, and others as a cornerstone of the ‘genre.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-you-should-hear-first&quot;&gt;WHAT YOU SHOULD HEAR FIRST&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to pinpoint specific albums for different ideas because each record covers so much ground. Also, the recorded works are really only a fraction of what’s available to enjoy. So I’ll cover a few compositions that are core to the Phish experience and you can explore as you will from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a well-rounded ‘This is Phish’ experience: &lt;em&gt;Harry Hood&lt;/em&gt; off of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Live_One&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Live One&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Reba&lt;/em&gt; off of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawn_Boy&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lawn Boy&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. There is also an amazing live rendition available on YouTube &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/cnJlBWjDeXA&quot;&gt;here &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/AKmIV1SY9gY&quot;&gt;here &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/cnJlBWjDeXA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For completely weird, Zappa-esque outlandishness: &lt;em&gt;David Bowie&lt;/em&gt; off of &lt;em&gt;Junta&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Split Open and Melt&lt;/em&gt; off of &lt;em&gt;Lawn Boy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For compositional complexity: &lt;em&gt;All Things Reconsidered&lt;/em&gt; off of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rift_(album)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rift&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Fluffhead/Fluff’s Travels&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Junta&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For balls-to-the-wall guitar rock: &lt;em&gt;Chalkdust Torture&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Picture_of_Nectar&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Picture of Nectar&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Run Like an Antelope&lt;/em&gt;, again from &lt;em&gt;Lawn Boy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For wonderful melody and songwriting: &lt;em&gt;Horn&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Rift&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Esther&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Junta&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Divided Sky&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Junta&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you’re looking for something REALLY out there, check out &lt;em&gt;Dave’s Energy Guide&lt;/em&gt; or any improvisation labeled &lt;a href=&quot;http://phish.net/song/daves-energy-guide&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;DEG&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Phish has provided so much improvised content over their career that there is a meta-labeling system to help categorize different ‘types of jams’ from their library of work).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be foolish to try and pigeonhole Phish’s music into a specific label or category. They simply do too much different shit to fit into a single bucket.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>33 in Buffalo</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-context&quot;&gt;Some Context&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I posted the &lt;a href=&quot;/interview/steve-vai&quot;&gt;Steve Vai interview&lt;/a&gt;, MWM started getting a lot of attention. I got an email from Robbie while he was in Europe traveling with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/BannedFromUtopia/&quot;&gt;Banned from Utopia&lt;/a&gt; in October 2015. We ended up having a lot in common and connected via Facebook. He sent me a copy of his wonderful record and some YouTube videos and I knew we had to chat. So, we met on a rooftop in Manhattan while I was traveling for work and we made some MWM content. And here we are!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, &lt;a href=&quot;http://audio.makeweirdmusic.com/learn/33-in-buffalo/33-in-buffalo.mp3&quot;&gt;download an mp3 &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;video-transcript&quot;&gt;Video Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;Ant: This is Anthony with Make Weird Music and I’m here with Robbie Seahag Mangano.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Robbie: Hi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: And, Robbie, why don’t you tell us about what you’re going to show us from your album, &lt;a href=&quot;http://treb-c-moon.wix.com/fullmoonfever&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Full Moon Fever&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;R: Okay. As you’ve requested to see about &lt;em&gt;33 in Buffalo&lt;/em&gt;… The number 33 actually has to do with the time signature of that whole riff. So it’s 10 notes, then another 10, then another 10, and then 3. So we got 33.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Is that in standard tuning?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;R: It’s in standard tuning. A friend of mine thought it was without open strings, but that sounds a little too hard to figure out. This was actually pretty hard to figure out because of this little move right there [hiding the middle finger under the others to slide on the high e string].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Ahhh… I was trying to slide with my pinky on the B string when I was figuring it out, but the fingering was too big.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;R: And that last note, I pick with the middle finger [on the right hand] because I’m never going to get the pick there in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Where did the song come from? What inspired it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;R: I play all day at home. Not all day, but there’s a guitar in a stand and the rest of them in cases all over the place. But, I pick it up and if I come across something I’ve never played before and try to get good at it. Especially if there’s a mistake. So that one came out as–maybe the notes came one at a time. And I wanted these notes instead of something easy like [plays an alternate phrase with open strings].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Oh, that’s cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;R: And also, it has a lot to do with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_Encounters_of_the_Third_Kind#Soundtrack&quot;&gt;Close Encounters theme &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also influenced by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaco_Pastorius&quot;&gt;Jaco Pastorius &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; song.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Oh, which one?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;R: It’s off &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaco_Pastorius_(album)&quot;&gt;his first solo record &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the one with the harmonics. I can’t remember the name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/v_kv_UjIM7Y?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: It’s a girl’s name, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;R: No, that’s Portrait of Tracy. This ostinato thing and he has a horn going and that sounds like my thing. So that’s where I think that kind of comes from, loving those melodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Right! Those intervals. Did you intend to write something in 10 + 10 + 10 + 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;R: Yes. At that point, I was thinking about the number 33 a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Interesting. Why’s that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;R: I’m into numbers. I’m not really sure why. Percentage is an interesting thing when there’s 3 people and there’s a split-up of something and it’s 33 1/3. If you’re going to split anything up it’s that 33 thing. That 33.333333. And they say that Jesus died at 33. It’s not like they would really know, but maybe there’s this secretive 33 thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Right. The freemasons and the 33rd degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;R: Right! I don’t know much about it, but if you do, let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: And what about the next part of the song? What about that? How do you play that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;R: I wanted to make 100, so I added one more note. Something about 33.33333 makes me unstable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: It’s unsettling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;R: So when I got to the last note, it’s 99 when I do it 3 times. So when I hit this last one, it’s 100.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: If you get paid by the note on this song, then you know exactly how much to charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;R: Exactly. First verse is $100. There’s overdubs on the next section [plays harmonies].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we start talking through the chords and intervals. And we wrap it up.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Zon Michael Manring Hyperbass</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;zon-michael-manring-hyperbass&quot;&gt;Zon Michael Manring Hyperbass&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was a teenager, I saw a video of Michael Manring playing a 3-octave bass with dynamic tuning capabilities and sorta became obsessed with the idea of owning one. In the late 1990s, the price was around $7,000. A brief Google search yields used ones for ~$10,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/interview/michael-manring&quot;&gt;Don’t know who Michael Manring is? Check out our interview with him! &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ad&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check out our &lt;a href=&quot;/concert/michael-manring&quot;&gt;private house concert with Michael featuring Andy West&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was always a fantasy of mine to see him play live, so I flew him out to our house for a house concert (video coming soon!) in April 2016. Not only did I get to see Michael play, but I got to have his wonderful instruments in my home for a few hours! Michael was gracious enough to do an interview about the instrument before the show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interview-video&quot;&gt;Interview video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a video of the interview:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interview-transcript&quot;&gt;Interview transcript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;Anthony: Hey, this is Anthony from MakeWeirdMusic.com and I’m here with Michael Manring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Michael: Hi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Uh, in my bedroom studio. So, thank you for traveling out here, Michael.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: My pleasure. Thank you for having me, Anthony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So, I wanted to talk about instruments that provide a unique voice for musicians and you certainly have one of those instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: I know something about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So, can you tell us about the bass you have today?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Yeah, this is officially known as the “Zon Michael Manring Hyperbass.” It’s a bass that Joe Zon and I designed together almost 25 years ago now and the idea was that there were a lot of different design possibilities that we wanted to try out on an instrument. We kind of decided, “Well, let’s put them all on one instrument and see what happens.” We weren’t banking on it being a success. It’s a prototype. That’s what it is; an experiment to see what would work and what didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;We ended up–I was gonna say we ended up being lucky, but what happened is Joe Zon is just really good at what he does and everything works beautifully. So, the instrument really works so well as an integrated whole, but it’s kind of its own beast and it’s just been a joy for me. It’s really opened up a whole lot of possibilities that wouldn’t be there otherwise. It’s a thrill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So what makes this instrument different from a regular 4-string fretless bass?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: So, a couple things. Probably the most obvious design change in this is the fingerboard is especially long. A standard bass fingerboard ends about here [points at the 21st fret] and then there’s a standard that ends here [points at the 24th fret] and this little bit is almost an additional octave because the notes get closer together as you go up the neck. So, extending it this far gives a lot more range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;However, the idea behind this wasn’t necessarily about having more range as much as it was we couldn’t figure out why not to do it. We knew where we wanted the pickup to be and we couldn’t think of why the fingerboard should end at some point before that and so we thought, “Well, we’ll just extend the fingerboard to the pickup and see what happens.” I don’t tend to do a lot of direct playing in this last little area of the fingerboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Occasionally it’s real nice to have. But, there’s other things that happen because I have fingerboard there that have ended up being really, really exciting. There’s lots of sounds I can make on that part of the fingerboard with my picking hand, my right hand, that really have become an important part of what I do. So that’s been a really nice thing and as time goes on, I’ve been kind of working on playing in this super stratosphere. It’s really kind of nice to have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;With bass, you’re always kind of running out of notes when you’re going for that extreme moment. That’s never going to happen on this instrument. There’s always more to play than I can usually manage to get to. So that’s the first thing about this. And then Joe decided to do a real deep cutaway so it’s not too hard to get up here. I have to kind of decide to go on top of the cutaway or underneath it in my fingerings that I use. And I’ll do either one depending on what kind of passage I’m playing, but it’s kind of nice to have that option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Is it the full width of the body behind the neck? Is there any sort of special shaping for your hand to reach?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: There’s no bevel. It’s just a straight cut back and in instruments we’ve been doing since this one–as I said, this one was the first prototype like this–he’s been doing some different shaping with that part of the instrument to see what works. It’s a lot of fun. I don’t know if there’s a right or wrong way to do it, but it’s kind of nice to see what can be done. So, yeah, that’s kind of the first thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Another interesting thing about this instrument that’s not immediately visible is the electronics. We wanted to do some different things with the electronics on this instrument and so one of the things that’s happening is underneath this pickup cover, there’s four separate pickups, one for each string. There’s a humbucking pickup for each string. So that gives me the ability to plug each string into a different amplifier or a different channel in a mixing board and really deal with each string individually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And this is something I’d been wanting to do for a long time and I just find really thrilling because it just opens up a ton of things you can do. I suppose it’s kind of obvious that you can do completely bizarre, crazy things, like put a massive amount of fuzz tone on one string and have the others clean, and that’s a lot of fun. But, often I’ll just use it kind of subtly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;If I’m recording–I use it mostly when I’m recording solo bass music and so I can have, for instance, the same reverb sound across all four strings, but it can be shorter on the low strings so I can have a rich reverb that doesn’t cloud up as much. I can have different kinds of compression on each string, all kinds of EQ, and panning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I can do panning differently with the strings and that’s something that has ended up being really thrilling to me. Just the panning thing alone, the sound that it makes really is something that really impresses me. If you have sound moved across a sonic canvas of some kind, it really behaves in a different way than if it’s all coming out of one thing. So, right, so that’s the quadrophonic magnetic pickup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;In addition to those four outputs, Joe built into the body ceramic pickups. There’s one up here [by the horn], one down here [on the lower horn], there’s one here [by the arm rest], and there’s one up here [in the headstock by the truss rod] in the headstock. And then the signal from those goes back here [flips over the bass]. There’s a little trim pot mixer, these little trim pots you can move with your fingernail so you can decide how much of each of those you want to have in the mix, so if you want to have just one in a separate output, you can do that. You can do different things with that where you can mix in different ways. And that comes out on a fifth output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;All these outputs work together out of a really nice multi-output jack by a company called Lemo Jack. It was a very expensive, groovy part of this instrument, using this Lemo Jack to do the multiple output. In addition to that, Joe figured out how all of those could be summed together so I could play this instrument in mono. I was so excited about these possibilities that it never really occurred to me that it’s kind of wildly impractical to have five inputs any time you want to play the instrument, so Joe built a mono output into this instrument as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;All these outputs are summed and you can still control the mix of the transducers, which is nice, and those come out a regular 1/4” output, just like any other instrument, and in fact, that’s the one I end up using most of the time just because it’s logistically so much easier. But, I love recording with the multiple output. So, that’s kind of the electronic aspect of this instrument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And then finally, probably the most bizarre thing about this instrument is that we designed it for dynamic tuning. For many years, I’d been interested in using different tunings on the bass. The bass is incredibly receptive to altered tunings and when you change the tuning, these kind of wonderful magical things happen. I just got very into this concept and realized there’s so much you can do with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;There’s so many different tunings you can do with the bass that I really wanted to keep moving beyond that and to go to the next level with it. And one of the places I wanted to go was into this area of dynamic tuning. So, not only is it about using these unusual tunings for the bass, these altered non-standard tunings on the bass, but being able to move those and change through those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I started trying to do that just by turning the tuning keys while I was playing. And that’s okay, you can kind of do a little bit with that, but I really wanted to take it a lot further than that and that was probably the biggest challenge from a design standpoint. Joe and I talked about this for a long time and talked about various systems we could do and we designed a few systems that we couldn’t afford to build. But we ended up with this system, which has really worked amazingly well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;What’s happening is that here at the headstock, we are using Hipshot Extender Keys. And this is actually a relatively standard add-on device for a bass. It’s designed to be put on your low string, typically on the low E string, and the tuning key sits on a kind of plate and when I move this lever, the whole tuning key tilts, just the tension of the string causes the tuning key to tilt. You can use that to drop your E string to a D or a C or a B. Really whatever you want. You can set it up with this little set screw in the back. And so these are two right-handed Hipshots and these are two left-handed Hipshots. I have one on each string here and it allows me to change the tuning of each string individually here at the headstock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Can you play us just a few notes to show us how it works?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Sure! [Plays harmonics and changes tunings.] So it’s a really nice tool to have. It really opens up a lot of possibilities. One of the things I discovered is that I really like the sound of the tunings moving. Just how it sounds when the bass moves, which is not something I expected necessarily and I often write pieces around that, just the moving of the tunings because to me it’s an appealing sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So in addition to this system, we did a system here at the bridge as well because we really wanted to do as much as we could at the time given the constraints of the technology and the amount of money we had to put into this. So, this bridge is one that Zon makes and it’s a little hard to explain. What happens is each string kind of sits on a kind of a tray and underneath the bridge, so they’re basically flat on one side and rounded on the other and these levers turn the cams. The trays, there are little set screws on the trays, and when I turn the cams, that causes the trays to move up and down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;You can set what you want the tunings to be with the set screws in the bridge. The bridge is designed to do three different tunings. You have a high tuning, a medium tuning, and a low tuning, more or less whatever you want within some limits. It depends on a lot of things like the gauge of the string and the tension of the string, things like that. Even how you set up the bridge makes a difference. But it does give you some really cool possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;As you move through the tunings in the bridge, you don’t have to have all the strings change, too. I usually set this bridge up, in fact, so that from the high position to the low position, the two high strings stay the same and then to the low position, dropping down all four strings. It doesn’t have to be that way, but it’s a thing I like to do with moving just two strings or all four or whatever you want to do. So, yeah, and then that moves all four strings like this. I’m moving all four strings a whole step. This is Bb, F, Bb, F and [flicks the cam on the bridge] now it’s Ab, Eb, Ab, Eb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So I use these two systems in combination to–it gives me a chance to go through a whole lot of tunings [manipulates both bridge and headstock tuners.] In one piece. And I think that’s pretty much it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: That is pretty incredible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Well, let’s get some footage of you playing. Let’s see if we can get this 5-output thing going. Thanks a lot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: You bet.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Homer Flynn Interview</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;special-thanks&quot;&gt;SPECIAL THANKS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extra special thanks to Mama Ralph (Lorrie Murray), social media director for The Residents, for making this happen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to Caustic Casey, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.causticcasey.com&quot;&gt;purveyor of Hellish Foods &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He manned the cameras and the audio recorder to ensure we had an error-free experience. Also, special thanks to Jenna at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/Reverie-Cafe-446696380600/&quot;&gt;Reverie Cafe &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in San Francisco for letting us set up and record in their beautiful garden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a video of the interview:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-context&quot;&gt;Some Context&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the most challenging interviews I’ve ever conducted. It was very difficult to interview a person about a nameless group of artists that’s, as he describes them, “a faceless façade.” There are a couple dozen interviews with Homer available online and most of the questions are the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people are concerned with the lore, particular releases, the story of the group. I’m more interested with the process, the art, and the creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus, I was a little nervous all day about not screwing up the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I don’t believe I was at my best, but Homer provided wonderful insights nevertheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homer Flynn has always been associated with The Residents as an owner of The Cryptic Corporation, but not much is publicly known about him. As soon as I saw &lt;a href=&quot;http://johanssonprojects.com/shows/homer_show.html&quot;&gt;photos from a public art gallery show of his work &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I knew I had to talk to him. To me, the art is just as much a part of The Residents as the music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weeks after some inquiries, I was able to get an interview set up, but Homer was so busy we postponed it for several months. The stars aligned and we were able to meet and chat on Wednesday, May 25, 2016 at 3PM in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interview-transcript&quot;&gt;Interview transcript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;Anthony: This is Anthony from MakeWeirdMusic.com and I am here with Homer Flynn. Homer, thank you so much for joining us. I really appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Homer: Sure. Hi, Anthony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Can you tell us who you are and what you do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: Yes. My name is Homer Flynn. I am one of the owners of &lt;a href=&quot;http://crypticorp.com&quot;&gt;the Cryptic Corporation &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The Cryptic Corporation is the managers, handlers, PR interface for The Residents. The Residents are an art, music, and performance collective in San Francisco since 1972.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: And how has the band–what’s unique about the band? There’s a movie called &lt;a href=&quot;http://residentsmovie.com/about/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theory of Obscurity&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and it’s primarily about The Residents and their history, but…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: Well, I suppose the most unique thing about The Residents is &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;they have chosen to present themselves as a sort of faceless façade.&lt;/span&gt; The group members have never been identified. They’ve never actually shown their faces. No one really knows if it’s the same people now that it was in 1972 and, as far as The Residents are concerned, that’s not quite important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: They have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.residents.com/home/page3/index.html&quot;&gt;quite a storied history &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; going from playing in a small shop to touring the world. Can you tell us about the evolution of their growth?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: Well, that’s a…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: It’s a big story. 40-some years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: Right. It’s a big question. Once again, they’ve been doing this since ‘72, so a lot of their evolution, I suppose–they started out sort of as the ultimate studio group. They didn’t tour. They didn’t perform live for the first 10 years. They were very influenced by people like &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/frank-zappa&quot;&gt;Frank Zappa&lt;/a&gt;, people who used the studio as a tool, as another instrument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Really, they came at it more from a point of view of non-musicians.&lt;/span&gt; They had an attitude that they learned to play something just well enough to get it recorded and then they would record it and never play it again, which is pretty much the opposite from a normal band where you get several people together, they all practice and practice until they get to the point where they can play a song, or a series of songs, well together. The Residents never did that. So, that kind of put them in their own space, more or less, from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;There was interest in them playing live, but they felt like their studio sound was so–once again, it was a very complex sound. It wasn’t complex because they were great musicians. It was because of the layering they would create with their recording techniques. It was such an interesting and unique sound they felt like people would be disappointed if they couldn’t re-create that live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/hBjs6nwzeSI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, for the first ten years, they didn’t play. All they did was record. And then, with the invention of samplers, at least on a broad level, the first thing being emulators back in the early 80s–at that point, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;they started feeling like maybe they &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; recreate their studio sound to some extent. That’s when they first started touring.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Another thing about The Residents is &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;they’ve always felt the visual side of their work was equal in many ways to the music side&lt;/span&gt; from the point of view of how &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; valued it. So, they were very early doing music videos. I’m the person who’s done a lot of their album covers, most of their album covers. I always felt that album covers were very important in terms of you giving some sort of signal as to what this project was all about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, once again, they started touring in the 80s, they did three tours in the 80s, they began to computerize in the early 90s when they first started doing MIDI. MIDI, of course, kind of took the real-time element out of music for them. And a lot of ways–you know, they &lt;em&gt;weren’t&lt;/em&gt; great musicians, so that just made things a little easier, or certainly more flexible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And then in the 90s, they were very involved in CD-ROMs. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Residents#1991.E2.80.9397:_Multimedia_projects&quot;&gt;They put out three CD-ROMs &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that were very well-accepted. There was so much working on that kind of material. [This is where Homer got a phone call and we had to cut.] So, anyway, in the 90s, The Residents virtually did not perform at all. They were involved in CD-ROM projects. That world kind of went away. And then they started touring again in the late 90s. And they’ve been touring fairly regularly ever since. Although, once again, things continue to change and evolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/oM20mw6PCh8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Their performance stuff–&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;The Residents really do performance art, they’re not really a band playing songs.&lt;/span&gt; So what they do really is very theatrical. But in some ways, as things come full circle or whatever, the kind of shows that they’re doing now are really more band-oriented. In some ways, the version of The Residents that exists now is called “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.residents.com/historical4/rcb/&quot;&gt;Randy, Chuck, and Bob &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.” Randy, Chuck, and Bob have been referred to as “the world’s greatest Residents cover band.” So, anyway, that’s a sort of capsule summary of 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: That’s wonderful. It’s interesting you had mentioned The Residents didn’t tour until they were able to replicate some of their sound live. However, now, these “covers” by Randy, Chuck, and Bob–these performances are &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; different from the original songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: Right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Was that a matter of maturity, growth, confidence? Or is it just a different era of the band?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: Yeah, honestly, I was say maturity, growth, confidence is probably hitting it pretty closely. You know, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;when they first started contemplating touring in the early 80s, they didn’t have any confidence in what they were doing.&lt;/span&gt; They really felt like–which is not to dismiss what they did at that time–but at the same time, they kind of felt like they needed a certain amount of smoke and mirrors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/B3sEgtM8oKI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;When they took their first show out, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mole_Show_Live_at_the_Roxy&quot;&gt;The Mole Show &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in ‘82, I think–they had 20 gigantic backdrops. The backdrops were 20 feet tall and 10 feet wide, I think. It took them, literally, 4-5 hours to set up just the backdrops before every show. That tour lost anywhere from 10-20,000 dollars depending on whose accounting you went by and you were lucky if you got any accounting at all from anybody. It was a complete and total disaster and ultimately, as their confidence and maturity has grown, they’ve become much more efficient about what they do. Ultimately, I think that efficiency pays off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: How about you as an artist? Your art has evolved quite a bit. Did you go through similar stages of development as you worked alongside The Residents? Were you going through something similar?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: Sure. I would say so. My own evolution–&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I try to do things a lot simpler now than what I used to. I used to feel like things needed to be very busy and complicated&lt;/span&gt;, but once again, that also has to do with the evolution and changes in the technology and the culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: The efficiency of the tools, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: And the efficiency of the tools, but it used to be that when you did a primary graphic for an album, it was an album cover. It was 12 inches by 12 inches. You had a lot of space there to fill up. Now, ultimately your primary graphic or marketing tool is something that’s gonna be maybe 2 inches by 2 inches and show up on iTunes. You better be pretty economical with that. So, once again, all these things have changed and evolved. If anything, what I’ve learned over the years is that you have to learn how to surf the changes. You can’t fight the changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Ah, interesting. So, speaking of which… The music industry has completely changed. The way people participate with music and art has completely changed. What are some of your thoughts on the way people do that now as opposed to, maybe in the 1970s when it seems that maybe there was an artistic prime in those kinds of industries and tech wasn’t invading everything?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: Well, I have mixed feelings about all that. I mean &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;in some ways I can understand what you’re saying and on the other hand I see how tech has opened the doors wider open than ever.&lt;/span&gt; At this point in time, anybody with a laptop, if not a phone, not only has musical instruments, but they have a studio right there. Ultimately, I could sit here at this table in this coffee shop and I could create a song on my phone. I could post it on &lt;a href=&quot;http://soundcloud.com&quot;&gt;SoundCloud &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and I could have something up and out for people to consume within an hour, were I so inclined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: No record companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: I think that’s great. On the other hand, by the same token, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;there’s a massive amount of garbage out there. If you are a consumer weeding your way through all of that garbage, it can be pretty daunting.&lt;/span&gt; It used to be, when I was young I’d go to a record store. You’d thumb through some albums. If a cover caught your fancy, maybe someone would play a little bit of it for you… Once again, the choices were a lot simpler, the times were a lot simpler. But, again, you surf the changes. You don’t fight the changes. I try to find what I feel is the good part of the way things have changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: As you’re looking around the music industry and art today–like you said, there’s a lot of garbage–are there any &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; artists that you admire, whether in visual graphic design or in music? Anyone that you’re looking at, thinking “they’re doing it differently” like The Residents are doing it differently?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: Well, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;it’s hard to find anybody that I can compare to The Residents.&lt;/span&gt; I mean, The Residents are still pretty unique even though, in a lot of ways, The Residents are not as “out” at this point as what they were in the mid-70s. There is no basis of comparison. There was no basis of comparison at that point. You can actually compare The Residents to some extent now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/0pdDkql6VYE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But, I certainly seek out new music and find stuff that I’ll like. There’s a Finnish group called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alamaailman_Vasarat&quot;&gt;Alamaailman Vasarat &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I’m an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMusic&quot;&gt;eMusic subscriber &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and so with eMusic, I pay $14/month subscription and you download. It’s like a use-it-or-lose-it deal. So, if you don’t do it, you don’t get ‘em and that forces me to download new music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So this group–I think it was just something that was recommended to me on eMusic. It’s a fairly large group, 7 or 8 pieces. Maybe 9 pieces, with horns. They were kind of lumped in with Eastern European music. They are kind of almost like a punk jazz fusion that I find very unique and very compelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Something else that I just downloaded from eMusic… Sometimes my deadline is coming so I get desperate. I have to download something. So, I discovered these Russian a capalla recordings. They must have 20 albums out. It’s called something dumb like “Free ‘n Easy” or “Sweet ‘n Jazzy” or something like that, but they had one entire album of Michael Jackson covers and they had this great version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Jean&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Billie Jean&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that I just popped up on my iTunes yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, anyway, the point is I still think there’s a lot of interesting music being created because the tools are so fantasti, but at the same time, you have to work hard to find it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/NRweyGHJ3bc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Right. So, The Residents in their early stages seemed to be pretty rebellious, maybe even politically motivated in some senses with Third Reich and Roll, there’s controversy there. Not, it seems to be more thematically weird. Their music has evolved over time. Obviously not running out of things to say, but like you said, they were incomparable at the time and now they’re more comparable to music. Is that because the rest of the groups out there have caught up?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I think the culture has caught up to The Residents to some extent.&lt;/span&gt; I do because, you know, The Residents are… older at this point. There’s kind of two things there. It’s kind of hard to keep charging again like you’re in your early 20s or 30s, and at the same time, I don’t think they feel it’s necessary to do that as much now as they did then. So, I think you have both of those things working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: A lot of the themes, lyrics, and music are fairly dark for The Residents. I’d say there’s a lot of dark music in their catalogue. Is there something motivating that? Is it just fun and weird for them? How do they think of a story about a deranged clown like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweedles&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tweedles&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Lover&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Lover&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;? Where do these themes come from and how do they motivate the music?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: You’re correct that those things–there’s a certain dark aspect to those. From my own perspective, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;they’re just sort of reflecting life as they see it. There’s also a lot of humor in those exact same things.&lt;/span&gt; They try to balance out the darkness with a certain amount of humor. People bring that up at times and usually when they do, I say, “How closely do you read the headlines on CNN?” From my point of view, The Residents aren’t nearly as dark as real life. If you wanna go out there and start–I just saw one yesterday that’s like a manhunt for a guy who murdered his 8-month-old son. The Residents would &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; go there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ob1hLi0UFP4?list=PL4yn92zU2slE2P4a9RKpZ9_PYoxJOekd4&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yeah, that’s pretty interesting. In terms of the musical evoluation and maturity of the group, can you tell us about how songs come together? How do these album concepts come together? I think you mentioned in a couple interviews something about train wrecks. How do these songs come together and what inspires some of these themes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: Honestly, it’s hard to know exactly where some of these things come from. They usually just kind of appear on their own. Some things appear in a fairly intact way. The train wreck thing–there is one of The Residents in particular that’s had this great fascination and love affair with trains. It was really another one that suggested doing something with trains knowing how much this one loved trains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;They thought it’d be interesting to do something about trains, but typically with The Residents… &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;What are you gonna do with just trains? You have to go somewhere with it&lt;/span&gt; and a lot of times these things pop up more or less intact. Other times they evolve with the creative process or with research, which can be kind of the same thing. With this one, “Okay… train wrecks. What can we do about train wrecks?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;What they found was a book for want of a better term. It’s really a Kindle download that is a collection of newspaper articles from the late 1800s to early 1900s. It’s called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Death-Train-Terrifying-Accidents-1879-1927-ebook/dp/B00JFL9OWA&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death by Train&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, it’s not &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; train wrecks. There’s a lot of train wrecks in it, but it’s also people that fall on the tracks. The train runs over them and they get cut in half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So they started reading this book and what they found that was particularly fascinating was the language of that era was so elegant and eloquent, but the events that they were describing were so completely horrific that the juxtaposition of the language against the events created a kind of interesting tension. In a lot of ways, that became–at least from the point of view of the text–became a lot of the inspiration for the lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But also, too, they also wanted to revisit from a form point of view, they had wanted to revisit something similar to their &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eskimo_(album)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eskimo&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; album. In a lot of ways ever since &lt;em&gt;Eskimo&lt;/em&gt;. So, the form of the &lt;em&gt;Train Wreck&lt;/em&gt; album is closer to &lt;em&gt;Eskimo&lt;/em&gt; probably than anything else they’ve done. It’s very multi-layered, it’s a collage of music, sound effects, singing, spoken word, textural stuff. So, anyway, those are the elements that sort of came together or are in the process of coming together to create that album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: And as a group that started out as not-great musicians, has the process of writing and assembling music become more enjoyable? More sophisticated? More fulfilling? Or, is music now secondary? As an artist, maybe you get an idea for graphics or something and you might propose that and maybe that inspires something?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: Sure, they’re always open to inspiration. So, yeah, if I were to do something graphically inspiring to them, they could take that and run with it for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Where do you see The Residents having impact on the world today? Obviously after several decades, they’re survivors. You said culturally you feel things are catching up to The Residents. Do you feel that The Residents have had a broad impact or has humanity changed and ideas have changed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Given the fact that 9 out of 10 people that you walk up to on the street will ask you, “The Residents? Who’s that?” It’s hard to feel like they’ve had a broad impact.&lt;/span&gt; I know they’ve had a significant impact on a smaller group of people, both in terms of other musicians and fans. We always said or discovered that, historically, a typical Residents fan was the weird freaky nerd that couldn’t relate to anybody in every little small town everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And I don’t know if that’s quite as true as it used to be, but &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I do think that for the people that have found The Residents and have felt alienated, disenfranchised… The Residents have opened a door for them.&lt;/span&gt; They said, “It’s okay to be weird and crazy and not be trying to imitate Beyonce or Jay-Z or whatever’s popular. You can follow your own path and that’s okay. That’s a good thing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[This next question legitimately makes no sense.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: And your sense as an artist, a graphic artist and somebody who uses technology–I feel like The Residents pushed a lot boundaries for many years and your art has always stood out. You can look at a video like Constantinople and go, “Nobody does art like that.” When you look at your artistic career, do you feel like there’s this still this consistent voice that is still unique and still will carry on and The Residents will still perpetuate that, people will be inspired by that? Or do you feel like it is its own thing for that little crowd and it’s special on its own like a gift to that small crowd?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/fcI5rNR5TGM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Well, personally I don’t see The Residents as having broad appeal.&lt;/span&gt; They’re never going to threaten Justin Bieber, but at the same time, I’ve always felt that to some extent that they were underexposed or underexploited and, you know the documentary, it’s gonna be interesting to see what kind of impact that has over time because, having been to quite a few screenings of that and spoken to various people about it, the response has been great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;There are an awful lot of people who, for one reason or another, happened upon a screening of it that don’t know much, if anything, about The Residents and they’ll talk about how inspired they were by it and how it makes them want to know more. Well, that’s a great thing. So, once again, it’s kinda hard to know what the future’s gonna bring, but I do think the influence and impact of The Residents will continue to grow over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/07/new-york-1percent-stifles-creative-talent&quot;&gt;an article &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Byrne&quot;&gt;David Byrne &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/03/leave-new-york-for-los-angeles&quot;&gt;another &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby&quot;&gt;Moby &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about the cost of living in artistic cities like New York and how there are cities like Florence and Venice that used to be flourishing with art, but now people just visit to take things away from it and not contribute to it. Do you feel, being a San Francisco-based artist, do you feel that’s happening here? Or do you see the art community is still flourishing, thriving, and doing well?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: Well, to be completely honest, I’ve never considered San Francisco to be much of an art center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Really? I’m from Phoenix, so compared to Phoenix…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/-am0-Oh6ypo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: I think LA is more of an art center than San Francisco. San Francisco is a great culinary center. It’s a great tech center. But, San Francisco, while I do know some great artists here, it does not particularly seem to embrace or cherish its artists. San Francisco looks towards New York or London or Paris. Why that is, I don’t know. &lt;a href=&quot;http://biblehub.com/luke/4-24.htm&quot;&gt;Jesus famously said &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “No man is a hero in his own hometown.” I think there’s some of that, for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I think in terms of supporting an artistic community here, I think it’s difficult in a lot of ways and I think, for young people, honestly there’s not much of a chance if you’re not part of the tech crowd making $150,000 a year or more, you can kind of forget it. Now, that doesn’t mean that you can’t find a place to live in Oakland or somewhere in the Bay Area, but it’s not very easy in San Francisco at this point. It’s like Manhattan and Brooklyn or something. Young people don’t go into Manhattan and get an apartment, but there are plenty of places in Brooklyn and a lot of young people are there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: The Residents, I think it was the 40th anniversary tour, they did the Wonder of Weird. What is it about “weird?” It’s in the title of my website, but for me it’s like “a unique voice.” What is it about The Residents that they’re embracing “weird?” What does it mean to them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: Honestly, my point of view is that &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;they’re not afraid to be themselves and afraid to be original. You can label that weird or not. That’s kind of irrelevant.&lt;/span&gt; I think most people don’t either have the confidence or they’re not bold enough to listen to their own unique voice and act on that. I think there are a handful of people out there that can listen to their own unique voice and do something that’s popular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;If you listen to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_Wonder&quot;&gt;Stevie Wonder &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; back in the 70s, the guy was just a fountain of beautiful, catchy pop music. It’s what &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Wilson&quot;&gt;Brian Wilson &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was in the 60s and I don’t think they were &lt;em&gt;trying&lt;/em&gt; to be popular. They were just being their own unique voice. But, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;so many people are unempowered or afraid to really be unique and original when that’s inherent in everybody.&lt;/span&gt; You could say–if you want to call that weird, that’s okay, but to me it’s “normal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Do you feel that you have found your own unique voice? Did you struggle with that over the years or have you always just kind of been you and you’ve done what you’ve done?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: Yeah, for the most part for me I supposed that came fairly easily. I can’t necessarily say why. As a graphic artist, when I started out, I knew that I didn’t really have the chops to be able to–I was always a big MC Escher fan. If you look at some of Escher’s work and the elegance with which he would hand-cut this wood, I thought, “I could never do that in a million years.” But, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;on the other hand, I guess I had confidence that I could do something unique relative to me and who I am.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Can you tell me about that? Who are you and how does that come out in your art?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: It’s hard to say other than attempting to be true to myself. It’s hard to say how that comes out. I think sometimes it’s more successful than others, but I think that’s true of any artist. To me, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;the most important thing about any kind of creativity is to be open. I feel like creativity is the process of life passing through you so that if you are truly and genuinely open to life, you open up, life comes in, it passes through you, and in the process of passing through, you stamp it or you flaw it or you beat it up and it comes out with whatever your unique sensibility is.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/MTJJb1UqjuA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: What do you feel are some of your works that reflect that unique sensibility most?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: I was always very proud of–you mentioned &lt;em&gt;Tweedles&lt;/em&gt; earlier and I thought that &lt;em&gt;Tweedles&lt;/em&gt; did a very good job of–at that time, I was working with 3-D graphics programs, particularly with a program called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poser&quot;&gt;Poser &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that was/is optimized for human figures and now, I guess the program is still around but I haven’t worked with it in a while. It was optimized for human figures and animal figures and the whole idea of the program is that the little wooden mannequins that artists have used for years to create poses, well this was the digital version of that and ultimately became very sophisticated, but the program was never hugely successful so it went from one company to another to another to another. And every time somebody would add something else and it got difficult to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Anyway, that was kind of the apex of my 3-D graphics short career and I felt very positive about that in terms of feeling like &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;it kinda captured where I was at at that time and I feel like that album was that.&lt;/span&gt; Also, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Third_Reich_%27n_Roll&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Third Reich ‘n Roll&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Eskimo&lt;/em&gt; were things that I felt like really captured where I was at and where The Residents were at at those moments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I look at those pieces and they’re as iconic as Andy Warhol’s Marilyn Monroe. I think they’re incredibly unique, there’s never been a piece that looked like these and I feel like &lt;em&gt;Eskimo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Third Reich&lt;/em&gt;, those two pieces stand out. So, for me, thinking about where you might have been at that point is interesting because you say you’ve developed over the years. You mentioned Tweedles, which is a recent thing, but there’s also some early work. It’s cool to hear an artist say, “I like stuff that I used to do &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; I like stuff I’ve done recently.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: Sure, to me it’s an ongoing process and I still feel like I have things to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Do you have more things to say? [Another idiotic question.] You have a wellspring in you and you’re highly motivated? Or do you feel like after 40 years of doing this, you’ve got a few ideas you want to get out and you’ll feel good after that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: I’m still pretty motivated. One of the more interesting things that’s happening right now is The Residents’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_in_Three_Persons&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;God in Three Persons&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from 1988 is in development as a stage piece and I’m pretty involved in that. I’m very excited about it. As time has moved on, they’re almost like parallel lines of The Residents. One, of course, is the new stuff that’s still being created, but the other is continuing to sort of mine the legacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Is it refreshing? That process? Is it satisfying to go back and sort of articulate certain things?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: For the most part it is. I’m not someone who enjoys rehashing the past in particular, but at the same time, for &lt;em&gt;God in Three Persons&lt;/em&gt;, The Residents always felt it was a stage piece waiting to happen and there were no resources or connections to make it happen up until the last, say, three or four years. So, the fact that there are new people wanting to get involved–a director, a producer–right now, this is set for a reading at ACT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;ACT is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Conservatory_Theater&quot;&gt;American Conservatory Theater &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the longtime, primary established theater group in San Francisco. So, there will be a reading of &lt;em&gt;God in Three Persons&lt;/em&gt; at ACT in September and the fact that there are, like I said, a lot of people involved in this and excited about it, that gets me excited too. That doesn’t feel like it’s rehashing the past. It feels like it’s giving new life to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Are The Residents bigger than ever? Do you feel like they have a bigger following than ever thanks to the internet, thanks to distribution that’s easy to access?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: I don’t know. If you look strictly from a sales point of view, I’d have to say, “Absolutely not.” But on the other hand, there are things that I think were more trendy at one time or another. And once again, when it comes to sales, nobody sells as much as they used to. You look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_(Michael_Jackson_album)&quot;&gt;Michael Jackson’s &lt;em&gt;Thriller&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, what’d it sell? 50 million copies? 65 or 70 million copies? I mean, something that sells &lt;em&gt;2&lt;/em&gt; million copies now is considered to be a big hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/fKipv2OAlcQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, once again, that has more to do with changes in the culture than it does with The Residents, really. I think in terms of their hardcore following, I think, “Sure, they’re as popular as ever.” The Residents just finished a tour. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Shadowland-Residents/dp/B00RZVBNYY&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shadowland&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the most recent show, they’ve done close to 55 performances of it. That’s pretty successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yeah, that’s incredible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: So, I suppose it just depends on what your measuring stick is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Well, it’s been super-enlightening. I’m really grateful for your time. And congratulations to you &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; The Residents. I think you are an incredible group of people. What you’re doing has had such an impact on me and so many other people. I love your art, I love the music that The Residents make. It’s just wonderful. Thank you for doing what you and the band do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: Well thank you. It’s always nice to hear those things. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Sometimes, you feel like you’re kind of isolated in your little studio somewhere. You’re staring at a computer and it’s like, “Is there actually a world out there?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: There is, man. There is a world. Casey is a big fan. He’s the guy behind the camera. I want to give him an opportunity if he has a question to ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;Casey: No, I think it was covered. Oh, one thing! &lt;em&gt;Tweedles&lt;/em&gt;. There was talk about it being a stage show like &lt;em&gt;God in Three Persons&lt;/em&gt;. Why was it never put on tour? Is it because the timing was bad? Because it does seem destined for a tour, I would think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: Yeah, it does seem like a timing issue. I’m trying to think what was happening… &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demons_Dance_Alone&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Demons Dance Alone&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was a big tour. I kinda of think maybe that was right before &lt;em&gt;Tweedles&lt;/em&gt;. And then I think &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bunny_Boy&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bunny Boy&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was right after. I think maybe &lt;em&gt;Bunny Boy&lt;/em&gt; just felt like a fresher project when it was time to tour. But, I think Tweedles could make a very interesting show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;C: So, there’s still talk of it being a stage show as opposed to a concert type of thing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: Yeah. Honestly, I think it lends itself more to a theater piece than it does to a concert. You know, watching audience reactions to things… Audience reaction to &lt;em&gt;Shadowland&lt;/em&gt; has been pretty fantastic and I think &lt;em&gt;Shadowland&lt;/em&gt; is a good show. I think it’s a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good show, but I think it’s almost a straight ahead rock show for The Residents as compared to &lt;em&gt;Demons Dance Alone&lt;/em&gt; or, heaven forbid, &lt;em&gt;The Mole Show&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/YAb_5RePyLc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, my sense is that audiences are–audiences have so much material to choose from that they almost need something a little pre-digested and categorized. The more you have a tendency to blur the lines of categories, the harder it is to sell it. I think that if you took something like &lt;em&gt;Tweedles&lt;/em&gt; and you said, “Okay, this is not a rock show, this is a theater piece.” &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;And you put it in theaters, I think audiences are going to be more accepting of it than if you tried to take it into rock clubs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;People are not going to have the attention span as they do for music. I feel like that was one of the things–the reaction to &lt;em&gt;Bunny Boy&lt;/em&gt; was very mixed because it was very theatrical whereas if you step back to &lt;em&gt;Demons Dance Alone&lt;/em&gt;, it was theatrical, but more purely musical. And I think that was a more successful tour, once again from an audience point of view, not necessarily my point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Thank you so much, Homer. I really appreciate it. It was great talking to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;H: Yeah, yeah! My pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Ben Levin Interview</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;special-thanks&quot;&gt;SPECIAL THANKS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://andyalt.com&quot;&gt;Andy Alt &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for connecting me and Ben. Andy is the mastermind behind the amazing guitar pickup, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alittlethunder.com&quot;&gt;A Little Thunder &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-context&quot;&gt;Some Context&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is our interview with the creative genius, Ben Levin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d never heard of Ben before Andy tagged me in a comment on a video Ben posted and suggested I interview Ben for the site. I was flattered that someone as busy and popular as Andy would think of me, but I was doubly impressed at Ben’s music video. It was visually creative, the music was very interesting, the lyrics were profound, and Ben was just a fun-looking dude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We soon started chatting on Facebook and I found that he’s the guitarist for a band I’d only briefly listened to called Bent Knee. &lt;a href=&quot;/interview/mike-keneally&quot;&gt;Mike Keneally&lt;/a&gt; had posted something on Twitter about “the incredible Bent Knee,” so I put Bent Knee in my private list of music I should someday get to hearing. Personally, I was more entranced by Ben’s solo music than I was with Bent Knee’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Ben sent me a full copy of his latest solo effort, &lt;em&gt;Life and Back&lt;/em&gt;, as well as a preview release of Bent Knee’s to-be-released album, [&lt;em&gt;Say So&lt;/em&gt;]. My mind was blown! At that point, I knew I had to prioritize Ben in the queue of people waiting for me to schedule interviews. So here we are!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.benlevingroup.com&quot;&gt;Don’t know who Ben is? Check out his website! &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This interview was conducted on Monday, April 11, 2016 at 9PM AZ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interview-transcript&quot;&gt;Interview transcript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;Anthony: This is Anthony from MakeWeirdMusic.com and I am here with Ben Levin. Unless it’s “Le-VIN…” Is it “LE-vin?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Ben: No, “LE-vin” is good. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: All right, cool. Ben Levin from &lt;a href=&quot;http://bentkneemusic.com&quot;&gt;Bent Knee &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Ben, I have been listening to your music in Bent Knee and your solo music. It’s pretty incredible stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I was wondering if you could introduce yourself. Tell us a little about yourself. Take as much time as you want and say as much as you feel is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: Okay. Hello, I am Ben Levin. I’m a musician. I make a lot of concept albums and really over-the-top music, but it’s always about little human things. I like telling stories with music and I like playing guitar. My favorite thing with music is making albums and writing then recording music. I think that’s the thing that is the most enjoyable aspect of life so far (outside of the love with humans thing, that’s pretty good too).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Let’s see… I am based in Boston and here I perform in a number of groups, mostly with the same people in those groups, but in different configurations. My pals who play in those groups and I have this collective called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.secretdogbrigade.com&quot;&gt;Secret Dog Brigade &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in which you find Bent Knee, &lt;a href=&quot;http://benlevingroup.com&quot;&gt;Ben Levin Group &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.secretdogbrigade.com/justice-cow/&quot;&gt;Justice Cow &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.secretdogbrigade.com/mr-gavins-meat-farm/&quot;&gt;Mr. Gavin’s Meat Farm &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.secretdogbrigade.com/that-one-eyed-kid/&quot;&gt;That One Eyed Kid &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, my solo stuff, and then &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.courtneyswain.com&quot;&gt;Courtney Swain &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (the singer from Bent Knee)’s solo stuff. And everyone else’s solo stuff as it comes up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I play in all those bands even though they’re mostly comprised of the same 8 or so people. It keeps me pretty busy and I teach music lessons on Skype. I have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/c/benlevin&quot;&gt;a YouTube channel &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and I make instructional videos as well as music videos. Private videos are just stupid running around and screaming. I’ve got about a dozen of those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Are those creatively done or are they more improvisational?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: Oh, that’s a good question. Well, they’re usually outtakes that I enjoy that I keep from when I’m trying to do something serious. Before I start filming an instructional video, when you’re making an instructional video or anything that you’re going to put on YouTube, I have no idea who I’m actually talking to and there’s so many ways to interpret a person, so I think &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;one of the safest ways to be inclusive when you’re making a video is to be happy just because, as long as you’re genuinely having fun, people can see that and at least they understand that you’re not resentful of the moment that you’re trying to bring them into&lt;/span&gt;. It’s more fun to be in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/7gwyVnft0OY&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, before I start recording, I’ll often be like HA-BLEE-DOO-LA-HOOGLAH-HEYGLUH-HOGLAH-HUNGAH! Or I’ll scream profanity or I’ll make up funny little phrases that are usually not too offensive, but it’s hard to think of one. They just kind of come. So, that gets caught on camera and then sometimes I think it’s funny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So it sets the mood?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: Yeah! And then I have a bunch of private videos that are old trailers for shows that I made when I was in college for concerts where I would be in college acting like a guy in college. Not that interesting to anyone except for my anymore. So, they’re there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Why so many bands at one time? What’s the purpose of having 8 separate groups with the same people?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: Well, that’s a great question. I know it’s kind of weird because it’s the same people. Everybody wants to be on our team, but everyone also wants to do their own thing. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;You can’t really sustainably hire people to play your music when you don’t make any money playing that music and you can’t have 8 bands succeed at once.&lt;/span&gt; Maybe someone could, but it seems like such a terrible gamble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, because there’s no way to get your music played by musicians and pay them, a better thing is to trade where it’s like I’ll play all of your songs, I’ll do whatever you want, and you play on my songs and you do whatever I want, and we’ll be in this band where we’ll collaborate, too. So everyone gets fulfilled in that way. Whoever’s got their own kind of path and music that they really want to try, gets a chance. And then, for Bent Knee in particular, it makes it so that when we’re in there, we’re much more easier to be democratic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;There’s a lot less conflict because we’ve all got some way of satisfying our own very nit-picky and control freak types of ideas.&lt;/span&gt; It creates a window for compromise. It’s sort of like an economy of creativity where I have the stuff I do absolutely by myself, it’s like life [inaudible]. I’ve done that a few times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Then I’ve got Ben Levin Group, which is music that I write, but ultimately I give an incredible amount of final say and power to everyone in the band, so it’s still pretty egocentric for me and pretty satisfying with “I can write the music and other people play it,” but there is a level of dependence, especially with the producer, Vince, who’s also in Bent Knee. He mixes all the Ben Levin Group stuff and produces it. It’s really a big, collaborative thing, even though it’s got my name on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And then Bent Knee is the ultimately democratic musical experience where everybody is equally involved in the music and the band is very familial in that way. There’s no leader. So, that’s the advantage of many bands with the same people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/9s7XwPw4Ie4&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: That’s great. How did you guys initially get together?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: We mostly met at &lt;a href=&quot;http://berklee.edu&quot;&gt;Berklee College of Music &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I’m in this band, That One-Eyed Kid, with someone I went to high school with. His name is Josh Friedman and he literally has one eye and that’s why the band’s called that. You’ll see him in a lot of my videos playing with me. I’ve been playing with him for a long time and then it made sense that when I went to college in Boston, I went to Berklee and he went to BU, and so we continued playing together and he’s been in Ben Levin Group since its second year. It formed in 2007 and he’s been in it since 2008 and we were in bands throughout high school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Everyone else I met through Berklee, pretty much. We all kind of started in Ben Levin Group to some capacity, like the violinist from Bent Knee, Chris and I met through Ben Levin Group. Courtney saw us at a Ben Levin Group show and then we started collaborating Bent Knee from that. Josh, the one-eyed kid guy, he’s in Ben Levin Group. Gavin, the drummer in Bent Knee, in Ben Levin Group. Just a lot of people. Everyone had something to do with the Ben Levin Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, that was sort of the beginning, but you can’t… Having the Ben Levin Group is like a composing studio group thing and it’s very important to me and it’s a very special space, but it’s very hard to do things by yourself or to always be in charge of everything. It was kind of against the grain for me to truly push that as far as it could because I wanted everyone to always–I wanted people to take on different jobs and help me manage the band and stuff, but I realized that can’t happen if it’s called Ben Levin Group and it’s just my music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I think it’s a maturity thing where you’re able to, at a certain age or a certain level of musical experience, be able to find just as much joy or maybe more in collaborating with others at an equal level than you do bossing them around.&lt;/span&gt; And the reason for that, I think, is when you’re in high school and you’re trying to be in a band with people and collaborate, you just fight all the time because everyone’s kind of an idiot. I’m not saying everyone in high school is an idiot, but you’re pretty bad at expressing yourself in a constructive way and being bold enough to say what you mean, but also sensitive enough to say in a constructive way and to take criticism–&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;collaborating in high school is incredibly hard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But then collaborating in college is only slightly easier. But then when you graduate from music school, a few years after you graduate, people start getting pretty good at music and pretty good at life, too. They start figuring out who they are for real and then you can start saying, “Hey, I have an idea for this, but this person always has great ideas and they might be better than mine and I actually want to hear them.” That’s why it took me so long to enter a fully collaborative project like Bent Knee and &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;it’s why Ben Levin Group was the first thing that happened because you’ve got a lot of hunger to make albums, but you don’t necessarily trust that everyone’s going to do a great job unless you tell them what to do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Right. &lt;a href=&quot;/interview/jeff-berlin&quot;&gt;I just interviewed Jeff Berlin&lt;/a&gt; a few weeks ago and he was talking a lot about music education and schools like Berklee. You ended up being a very creative person. Do you feel that your music education or the experience you had at Berklee ended up forming that or just educating it or opening/expanding horizons? All of the above? How did that experience help you as a musician?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: It helped me to be more creative and find my own voice because what happened was at Berklee, it’s sort of like an all-you-can-eat buffet of every kind of musical style, but there’s not enough time to really get 100% amazing authentic experience out of any one of them. So, unlike other music schools, where I think you can be completely focused on classical or jazz or one thing like that, and then become a true expert at that one field, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I think Berklee’s advantage is it gives people a chance to try everything and get pretty good at everything.&lt;/span&gt; There are people who get great at one thing there, too, but I think generally speaking, it’s a lot more of an experimental school to go to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;You try things out a lot. What that does is, because you’re surrounded by musicians and because you can try any kind of music you want at any time any semester, you get burned out on–well, not burned out, but you go through the process of trying and forming opinions about directions very quickly. So, I think it might have taken me maybe twice as long to discover that I even cared about bluegrass if I hadn’t gone to a place that provides bluegrass and metal because I wouldn’t have gotten my metal kick properly fed. I really wanted to learn some metal, that was there. I wanted to learn some jazz, that was there. I wanted to learn some bluegrass and that was there. I wanted to learn Middle Eastern music and that was there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/KBZRhlrPnTQ&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And so this whole phase of just figuring out what I like and trying things was accelerated that way and I don’t think it ever truly ends, but what happens is I think &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;when you’re in music school you make music that’s about learning music.&lt;/span&gt; So, I’m interested in this style and I want to make music in this style and so you try it. People do this all the time. It’s like, “Oh, I really like Michael Jackson, I want to make pop like he does.” So, you try to make a bluegrass song and, “What if I try to mix bluegrass with jazz?” Everyone does that! Mix this and mix that and mix this and mix that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And then you just sorta do it and then, for me, I didn’t want my music to be about learning music anymore because I got through that. Then music started being about more of a dialogue with the audience and with expressing things that are true in my life rather than making kind of meta-music about the things I’m learning inspired by the things I’m learning. I’m more inspired by life lessons and–I’ve got an album called &lt;a href=&quot;https://benlevingroup.bandcamp.com/album/pulse-of-a-nation&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pulse of a Nation&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is the first time that transition took place where I went from making albums about trying things out to now making albums about my life. That was about the first time I broke up with a serious girlfriend, my grandma died, and these are normal things that happen to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;You end a first relationship, you–and if everything goes according to plan, your grandparents die before you and your parents die before you and it’s a horrible thing. It’s really hard, but everyone goes through it and &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;that’s a really potent place to start writing music, even if it’s instrumental music&lt;/span&gt;, it can very clearly be about that and maybe people don’t understand that it is, but they can feel that it means a lot to you. And so I think Berklee helped me get to that point where I could start writing music that was about myself eloquently and also in a way that didn’t only make sense to myself because I had a really big vocabulary of styles, but I wasn’t also just obsessed with showcasing styles. I kind of had gone through that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Can you tell us a little about your influences? Who were the major musicians throughout your musical formation in your life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: Sure, yeah. I started out listening to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent_(musical)&quot;&gt;Rent the musical &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; over and over again on CD player when I was in elementary school. The original Broadway cast recording and I listened to the first disc for, like, a year every night. And I listened to the second disc after that. I listened to that obsessively and I really liked the way the melodies were and everything sounded really cool. I’d been playing piano at the time and so I was starting to be interested in music a little bit when I was in elementary school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But, then when I was in high school, I started getting into bands like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_(band)&quot;&gt;Nirvana &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weezer&quot;&gt;Weezer &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and these really emotional rock bands like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_a_Down&quot;&gt;System of a Down &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and stuff. That made me interested in guitar because I had a friend who was playing those songs on guitar and I was like, “Wait, how long have you been playing?” I was like, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;“You can play professional music after six months?! That’s crazy!!”&lt;/span&gt; He was like, “Yeah, whatever.” So then I wanted to play professional music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I wanted to play the music I listened to because on piano I never got good at any of those things I was trying because it just wasn’t the music I was listening to. I didn’t think I could do it. That was the other thing. But, it clicked in my head. It was like, “Oh, I can do this!” The Nirvana tunes and the Weezer tunes, they didn’t seem that hard and I started learning them. And so I was hugely influenced by grunge music and music about feeling pathetic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And then I got into metal, particularly &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megadeth&quot;&gt;Megadeth &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for a while because that was my first exposure to that kind of guitar playing, like with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marty_Friedman&quot;&gt;Marty Friedman &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; doing so many things. Such a versatile sound palette within just the narrow world of lead playing. They sound as full and rich as a human voice. Got into &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Led_Zeppelin&quot;&gt;Led Zeppelin &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for similar reasons. Then I started being obsessed with &lt;a href=&quot;/interview/steve-vai&quot;&gt;Steve Vai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Satriani&quot;&gt;Joe Satriani &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yngwie_Malmsteen&quot;&gt;Yngwie Malmsteen &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; because I saw the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G3:_Live_in_Denver&quot;&gt;G3 Live in Denver DVD &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and that’s when I started thinking I might want to do music for a living because I was so freaked out by Steve Vai in a great way that I learned everything I could about him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I found out he went to music school, he went to Berklee, which I hadn’t heard of, and then I was talking to my parents and I was like, “I think I want to go to music school. I could learn guitar in school.” And they were like, “Yeah, that’d be great.” And I was like, “Wait! So… college could be great! College could be really fun! Having a job could be guitar!” That was a lot from Steve Vai because &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Steve Vai, his life as far as his career goes, as far as the story of his career, is incredibly optimistic. It’s a really positive story.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I’m sure he’s had all kinds of hardship in his personal life, like everyone does, but his career arc is wonderful. It’s like, if you want to see if it’s possible, look at that guy. He went to music school, ends up in &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/frank-zappa&quot;&gt;Frank Zappa&lt;/a&gt;’s band, and then before you know it, he’s in all these big stadium gigs. But then, his greatest music is what got the most attention. He started a solo career that was really crazy and creative and that was like what I wanted to be doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I started making albums on my own in high school. I made four albums or five albums, four that I actually released and they were horrible. Total garbage.&lt;/span&gt; I did that all day every day when I wasn’t at school, so I don’t know if I got &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)&quot;&gt;10,000 hours &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from that, but that was enough time to make a lot of mistakes. I just made a lot of horrible music and then when I was in college, I made three or four, and since then I’ve made ten more. It’s my favorite thing to do! So, Steve Vai had a big role in that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And then, after college, I got really big into Sufjan Stevens and I got really big into &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Cave&quot;&gt;Nick Cave &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar&quot;&gt;Kendrick Lamar &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is my newest obsession. There’s the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tune-Yards&quot;&gt;Tune-Yards &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and I like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanza_Spalding&quot;&gt;Esperanza Spalding &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;’s new album a lot. You know, my thing shifted and I don’t listen to guitarists anymore, but that was a big thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I would say that Steve Vai had the most influence over my life up to the end of college and then &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufjan_Stevens&quot;&gt;Sufjan Stevens &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has had the most influence since then. I love the way he can make songs that are completely magical and enthralling and they’re about subjects I wouldn’t otherwise care about, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois_(Sufjan_Stevens_album)&quot;&gt;a whole album about the state of Illinois &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I’m from St. Louis, Missouri and Illinois never seemed that interesting and I never bothered to go there. Then he makes that whole state seem like a fascinating character, and it is. It’s a whole state. So much happens in a place and he shows the magic in that, which I think is incredible. And he did that for rodeos and he did that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_(album)&quot;&gt;for Michigan state &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and he did that for artists and he did that for, well it wasn’t that hard to do, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie_%26_Lowell&quot;&gt;this story of his relationship with his mom &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, he makes that very tangible. So, that’s kind of what I’m trying to do as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: One thing I found so interesting about your latest solo release is the looseness of time. It’s almost like the album is in a dream state where it’s like there are several drum patterns going on in slightly different tempos and you’re singing or rapping kind of in your own world, but it all comes together, it all falls apart, it all comes together. How did you get into that? Your musical influences up until you mentioned Kendrick Lamar and Sufjan Stevens are pretty straightforward music. They’re unique and interesting, but not so experimental in that sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: I think my process is whatever I’m listening to now in the time when I’m making the album. I just rip it right out and then I screw it up because I don’t have any experience with it and so the way that some hip hop is behind the beat, like particularly the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%27Angelo&quot;&gt;D’Angelo &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; record or any of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_Dilla&quot;&gt;J Dilla &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; disciples, and certain tracks on Kendrick’s album like that–Kendrick’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Pimp_a_Butterfly&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;To Pimp a Butterfly&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the greatest concept album I’ve ever heard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z-48u_uWMHY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I think it’s just the most amazingly executed album I’ve ever heard. It raised the bar on albums for me tremendously. It really flipped my life.&lt;/span&gt; And it’s only been about a year since I first heard it, but it &lt;em&gt;flipped&lt;/em&gt; my whole perspective on time and on what a concept album can do. It was one of the first hip hop albums that I &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt;. There are albums I think are really great, but this is an album that I can’t think of any album I love more than it and I think is necessary to use what you like about it in your own music. It’s necessary to have that love for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, the timing, the way they’re behind the beat is very nuanced. It’s the result of a lot of time playing, the music that came before the music they’re playing, there’s a lot of background and subtlety to how that “behind the beat” goes. But when you’re just now finding out about it and pointing at it like a straight line, like, “I’m gonna go behind the beat. NOW.” That creates a much more sort of caricature version of “behind the beat.” I think that by itself would be pretty stupid and pretty intangible, but I mixed it with all the stuff I know well from all the music I’ve already made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, there’s this certain cohesiveness I find. I’m pleased with it and I haven’t heard–not that many people have heard it in the first place–but I haven’t heard anyone complain about that. Actually, your coworker was pretty thrown off by it, but I think it eventually makes sense what it’s for because there’s microtonal melodies–&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtonal_music&quot;&gt;microtonal music &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is melodies where there’s notes between the notes and they use “out of tune-ness” in a standard definition of what “in tune” is and they bend that and, man, it sounds cool when you do it well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;The same is true in timing. You know how there’s only so many beats? [Beatboxes.] And then it’s like, [beatboxes]. And then it’s like [beatboxes]. And there’s [beatboxes]. These beats just keep popping up, but they always feel different when there’s different humans playing it. So, every human drummer has a different [beatboxes]. Every human drummer has a different one of those. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;So each time we hear a different human playing it, it is a different beat and for that reason, that inconsistency we get so much fresh energy from different songs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/DkM0Zlsmmg?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;That’s why the same chords can work over and over. It’s always going to be a different sound because it’s different people. So I was exploring that hard, microtonal beats thing. How far can you go out before it sounds “wrong?” I think whenever it went so far out that it sounded wrong, I’d try to make those moments very forcefully disturbing so that I’m using the “wrongness” and any time it felt like it was really in, I’d try to complement it with something beautiful. That’s how that went down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: A lot of software now on computers is very grid-oriented. It doesn’t leave a lot of room for those unknown territories. How do you assemble these kinds of rhythmic shifts and microtonal adjustments in whatever software you’re using when it’s not really a feature that Apple’s gonna build into Logic Pro or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: Yeah, well there’s some stuff that’s really mathematical. Mostly I play the beats in and that’s how I do it. I’m just not that good, so they’re sloppy. A tip for you musicians: If you make something sloppy and then you loop it in a quantized manner so the loop always starts perfectly on the 1, then it is not sloppy anymore. If you take the out of time thing and loop it perfectly, you feel that pulse, you feel that return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;So, you can play beats in for, like, 15 minutes and then listen to spots that really stand out, cut those and loop those spots.&lt;/span&gt; That’s a great start for some really organic, but in-time-out-of-time stuff. That’s something I do that’s pretty feel-oriented. I’ll just play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But then there’s also other tricks, like if you quantize to the quintuplet instead of the triplet or the eighth note and you don’t quantize at 100%, the notes don’t know where to go because you usually are playing or typing them on the triplets or on the 16th, so you’re evenly dividing things by 3s or by 4s or by 2s, but when you quantize to quintuplets, they sort of shift closer to the 5, which could be closer to the early 2 or the late 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;You can write in hi-hat parts and cymbal parts that are hard “out.” They’re &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; quantized to the quintuplet, but not all the way. They’re just not followable by themselves, but then you give a really on-time kick and snare, a perfectly executed kick and snare, and the next thing you have is a loose and dance-able groove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zUfoX275lOs?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I just think that some people learn music through analytical thought and some people need to jam it and need to hear it and some people need both. Everyone needs a little bit of both for sure, but some people are skewed for sure to the “I need to understand it from an analytical basis” and other people are more skewed to “I just need to absorb it from hearing it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;For me, I think, when I can think about something analytically, then I can actually make it organic because I’m not thinking while I’m doing it anymore. Once I understand the pattern, then I practice the pattern and then it’s no longer thoughtful and then I can skew the pattern in slight ways based on what’s happening around me. And other folks, if they learn the pattern, all they can do is remember the pattern, and think about the patterns inhibiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, I don’t know how a guy like Kendrick Lamar, or like some drummers I’ve played with who just have a really great instinct for the perfect “outness.” I don’t know exactly how they come to know that “outness.” Or if they think of it as “outness” as much as they think of it as how they like beats and that’s it. I know Kendrick Lamar’s a superb musician, so I imagine to some extent, even if it’s not how he does it, he’s probably able to analyze it to some extent. You know, When the snare and kick are really tight, but the bass is really lazy, then you’ve got an awesome thing there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I don’t know how much other musicians think about it as these formulas the way I do. I will say I’m not authentic with it in that I haven’t learned a lot of the grooves that these grooves are coming from in their original context. I’m just doing my own caricature impression of what I’ve heard from this album that changed my life, basically. Yeah, so, that’s how I was thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Guitar is your primary instrument. Correct?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: [Nods.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: There’s not much overt guitar on the album. Is that a constraint you set for yourself?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I think guitar is a widely overused instrument.&lt;/span&gt; I think there’s a pop culture and sexiness to it that was a big reason why so many people started using it and playing it. It’s a super versatile instrument, so if you’re going to play an instrument, that’s one of the best instruments to pick up. There’s lots of stuff to do as a beginner, there’s lots of cool stuff to learn, lots of resources. And then it’s a rabbit hole that goes forever, just like any other instrument, but the initial phase is really rewarding, unlike violin where the starting phase of learning violin is torture. It doesn’t even involve a violin. It’s just practicing bowing in the air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;The first phase of guitar is incredibly satisfying. You can play chords. I can show anyone, little kids, adults, anyone, to play 3 chords in a half hour lesson. They’re not hard to play. These are perfectly executed one-finger chords and they’re chords. There’s no way to say, “Well, that’s just a beginner chord.” It’s a chord. It’s totally legitimate and if you put it through distortion, 8-year-old boys have a life-changing moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Oxk9LGixbmM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Guitar is incredibly prominent as a social thing as a fun instrument to learn. And then everyone who starts a band has them. But, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I don’t think they’re treated equally with all the other instruments when people are writing for that reason.&lt;/span&gt; I think it’s skewed and I think it shows up just because they’re around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So then you have a lot of bands with two guitarists in it and there’s no reason why there’s two. The net result of there being two guitarists is that you can’t ever hear anything else. Just like there’s drummers who are always riding on the crash cymbal, which totally cuts out the vocals (if there are vocals)… It’s not like these people are consciously deciding to cut the vocals out, they’re just playing this instrument this way and they play it because they’re around and that’s what they’ve got.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I don’t think that’s a bad thing, but when I’m writing music, I’m thinking about instruments pretty democratically. The guitar shows up the amount I think that sound should show up. I’m definitely limited by the fact that I can’t just jump into the studio whenever I want and record a real string quartet or record a live drum and bass section any time I want, but I can do it pretty often because out here in Boston, I know musicians who I can do things for them and they can do things for me and get that trading kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I know those musicians and also there’s a recording studio that’s a non-profit called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.therecordco.org&quot;&gt;The Record Co &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that we do a lot of our recording at where they give a rate that allows me to experiment. So I’m still limited in that I can’t do it all the time, but I’m not as limited as I think I would be in some other scenarios. I just kind of lucked out with Berklee, it was a really lucky thing for me. I was lucky that I could go. I was lucky that when I was there, I actually met the people who I’m playing with now and that they stayed in Boston. And I’m lucky that the record company exists at all and that they are available to me. I’m lucky that everyone in my bands want to go spend a day in a recording studio even though they’ve got lots of work to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But, that was not your question, the question was about my limit of the guitar. But, rambling! That’s one of my strengths! I’m quite good at filling space. And you know what? Filling space, that’s another thing &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I’m really paranoid about filling space with the guitar. It takes up an incredible amount of range.&lt;/span&gt; It takes up a hefty amount of low end, and then an absurd amount of mid, and then if you’re going to mix piano and guitar and the guitarist is going blah blah blah blah blah, there’s gotta be a really compelling reason for those two instruments to be together in that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;There are lots of compelling reasons for that, but they just aren’t as common as, say, drums, bass, and one other thing. Drums and bass will be way more prominent in most of my music because I like beats. There’s more often than not a need for beats. There’s less often a need for a giant space-taking chord machine, which is guitar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Sounds like you think very texturally and sonically, not so much in terms of arrangements like, “Oh, I should have the guitar strumming here and I should have the bass doing this here.” It’s more like filling frequencies and painting kind of musical landscapes. Is that a good characterization?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: I think about arranging or voicing a chord. If you play a power chord on the guitar, it’s just two notes, but the way they are and the way they sound makes a huge sound, even if it’s a clean guitar. Even if it’s an acoustic guitar. The overtones are so deep and everything is so powerful with just those two notes. And most of the same lessons you get from that power chord you can apply to where the bass player is playing on his fretboard and where it lines up on the kick drum because one good thump on the kick drum with one good low F that’s sort of muted can be all the low end you need for the next two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But, similarly, if you take that same kick and line it up with a low F on an electric guitar, you’re in a totally different situation in terms of what else can be in the low end and you’ve still created that low thumpy F. And you can voice your whole arrangement like you would voice one chord on an instrument. So I think of it that way and I also think of it–because I’ve made a lot of crappy albums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I’ve made an astounding amount of crappy albums for my age because people are a lot more careful. I think they make better albums in terms of the number–usually people are too scared to make the investment to make a second crappy album after they’ve made the first one, so it’s usually people who hit a pretty good sound on their first one who make second ones. I mean, that’s not necessarily true, but &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I just get the feeling that people strike out less than me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/XXJryD1HMLA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I like everything since I made &lt;a href=&quot;https://benlevingroup.bandcamp.com/album/pulse-of-a-nation&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pulse of a Nation&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2009, but before that, stuff you can’t really find for the most part, some of it’s still there, but it’s pretty much garbage and a big part of the things I hear that are problems are just poor voicing of instruments. It’s just like, if you have four-part counterpart going on, you have four different things going on, I never really asked &lt;em&gt;why?&lt;/em&gt;. I just thought, “Wouldn’t it be neat to have four things happen at once?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I’m not saying you should question all those ideas, you should definitely try them. But once you do it, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;the reason why it’s there should be that it sounds good, not necessarily that you really wanted something with four parts in it.&lt;/span&gt; And that’s kinda where my mind went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I know Bach does it and I like Bach. He’s interesting. There’s this kind of, “I’m like Bach,” part of your brain that was more dominant before &lt;em&gt;Pulse of a Nation&lt;/em&gt; and then in my most recent work, I’m almost never thinking that way. I think that’s an evolutionary thing. I’ll look back to now and notice a lot of mistakes, but I just can’t notice them yet. I don’t know what mistakes I’m making, but I’m definitely making mistakes. I just can’t point to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s easy to point to, even in &lt;em&gt;Pulse of a Nation&lt;/em&gt; and beyond, these albums I like, I can still point to section by section and say how they could be better and change them. A lot of my music doesn’t sound good live from that time, but it works on a recording because you can cheat, you can double, and you can cut through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: It sounded like a lot of your time is spent teaching guitar lessons on Skype. Is that primarily how you make a living now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: Yeah, that’s basically all the money I’ve made since college. I’m hoping that Bent Knee makes money. I think if I were to spell out my ideal income structure, it would be: &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;make a lot of money from making music and then teach for free and teach sort of philanthropically&lt;/span&gt; where I would like to find people who definitely should go to Berklee or somewhere like that, would get a lot out of it, but can’t because the way things are right now–it’s like taking on more than $200,000 in student loans and then it’s really hard to take the kind of risks necessary to have a music career if you’re in that situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/xZBi-DNO36A?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s still possible, it can be done, I’ve seen it, but it’s unfair because you definitely get an amazing one-of-a-kind experience at Berklee, but I know if you could just get in a music community and have someone guide you through what Berklee &lt;em&gt;would have&lt;/em&gt; been like, if you got on mentor you pay once a week and you can get in with the community and it’s not the same thing as going there at all, but it’s a different way to get probably the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I know somebody who didn’t go to college at all who’s one of the people I play with all the time, he’s just as good and knowledgable as me and my Berklee pals. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;He’s self-taught. He was lucky he knew the right questions. He figured out what the right questions were and lots of questions and then he found people who could answer because they see his passion and they answer him.&lt;/span&gt; But, it looks like it’s going to be the other way around for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It looks like I’m going to be making a ton of music and, hopefully, continuing to grow in terms of how many people care about it. But, it could be a linear curve, or it could be an exponential curve. If it were a linear curve to my fan-reaching to how many people care over time, we’re talking at least another decade until that’s lucrative and then in that decade, there might not be an industry for just making your own albums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It might be people are making music for VR and they’re making it for video games and they’re making it for meditation and they’re making it for movies and they’re making it… tons of money making music, but I don’t know for sure that making your own albums will always be a source of income. Right now, even if it exists, you shouldn’t put all your chips in that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Touring is the alternative way to make money. If you’re an original band, you can do festivals and get paid a lot, so there’s money out there, but touring is not sustainable. Having gone on 16 tours that were all in a minivan and all sleeping on the ground and all that stuff, I imagine it’d be easier to tour for longer if you were in a nicer accommodation than what we do, but it is not a long-term sustainable income source if you want a family and if you want to be able to get sick and not have it ruin your career. Not have it bankrupt you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Now that’s not going to stop me from doing it, but I’m just saying that I shouldn’t expect that to be my–I should push that as hard as far as I can because of the music and then I should also anticipate other ways that I can turn that into money and I think one of them is: &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I want to be a famous musician because if I’m a famous musician, I can teach more people. I can reach people in large numbers. Colleges will give me a stage. I’ll be able to do clinics and you can make enough money that way. You can make a living. I think that’d be a beautiful way to do it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I think that for the original music I make is where, morally speaking, people should pay and then for education, we should all pass down the sacred art of music. But, I think that paying teachers is essential and I’m really glad people do pay for education in that the more education you can get online for free, the more people are realizing the value of one-on-one interaction and I’m getting all kinds of students who I think showed up on YouTube searching for lessons expecting to not pay for lessons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;They’re expecting to get everything from YouTube and they found something that really inspired them on my channel and then they want to actually study with me. I think that’s telling of how I’m giving so much for free and it’s my best effort at explaining things, but they still want to sign up, so I don’t think there’s going to be an end for people getting paid for teaching. I wouldn’t want there to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/BwdUAdc2VcE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But I’m just saying that if I could have things my way, I would just not have to worry about money with teaching and just do it maybe a little differently. I like my students, though. They’re the people who want to self educate, but ended up paying even though they can’t all afford it as often. They can’t do weekly lessons, some of them, and I really admire that hunger. You were going to get a free lesson and then you decided you got so much out of learning something that you wanted to pay and you weren’t even ever prepared to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I think that’s pretty amazing. I don’t know. I’m happy with things. I just want to make more money so I can do the other things that are important in life. I want a certain level of–I want to be able to help other people by not always needing to depend on my health being perfect and my stuff not being stolen. There’s emergencies and stuff that’s gonna be horrible, it’s gonna shatter things, I wanna have some money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I love your passion for all of these things. I think it’s really admirable and it’s wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: Same to you! I’m really impressed with what you’re doing. Your site looks beautiful and your stuff just comes across as like you really have a huge heart for it and it comes from this deep respect for music. It’s fun to hear and see it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Thanks a lot! That’s really nice of you! I really appreciate that. I have to say, and I think I emailed you about this, I was listening to your latest album and it was so personal that I had to stop listening to it. It was this crazy trip I was driving to Denver overnight, my wife was stuck in a blizzard on her way to the airport and the airport shut down and all this stuff, but on the way there on this 14-hour overnight drive from Phoenix, I was listening and some of the stuff you’re talking about is so personal and relatable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;I just recently delivered a presentation about Make Weird Music to a pretty large audience and I was so wracked by my nerves because it was so personal and I thought, “How did Ben release this music that’s so intimate and so deep and personal in a way that’s almost uncomfortable?” I really related to a lot of the things you were saying about the woman stuck in the infirmary, the old-people home, and the dignity of her humanity. Some of the lyrics in &lt;em&gt;Porn Sucks&lt;/em&gt;–it’s pretty funny, but also you’re like, “Wow, there’s some really insightful stuff.” Tell me about what it takes for you to go to that depth and really bare it all for the sake of music. Is that a struggle for you? Did you really have to overcome anything to get to that point?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: It’s cool. Thanks for asking me that. I’m really glad that the songs connected in that way. Those are really important issues to me. Especially ageism. It’s a word that doesn’t get thrown around that much. It’s sort of like fat jokes. People aren’t that sensitive to how fat people feel about fat jokes–not to get on you about the Suge Knight thing [referring to a joke I shared before we started filming], he’s kind of a dick–but I’m just saying particularly with elderly people. I mean, this is where we’re going. This is us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Elderly people–we &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; elderly people. If we assume everybody dies, then we’re already dead in that that’s like the majority of history as far as we know is going to be us dead.&lt;/span&gt; It’s this blip of life. Same is true about the elderly. I think it’s just really sad how they have to take a back seat on life in society. It’s also just really sad how aging looks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s very hard to cope with that reality. It’s very important to me. I think the reason why I write about things so bluntly and the reason why I’m able to do it is because I trust that if I do it in that kind of format, it’s the best chance I have at people seeing it as their own lens of it. Like, seeing it through their own lens rather than through mine because music just makes the human more relatable because &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I’m just a character in your stereo and you can only assume who I am. You’re really imposing yourself into your idea of me and for that reason, you can understand me better.&lt;/span&gt; You can empathize with what I’m saying. It’s the perfect medium for empathy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I don’t force enough details on you to make you see my story, I just give you enough for you to remember your story and then compare and contrast it to what I’ve given. I kind of feel like that’s my best way of being accepted in these confessions, or whatever they are. With anything that I feel that if I get it out clearly, if I can really say what I feel, other people probably feel that in some way in some part of their mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Like about the porn stuff, I think most people look at porn and I think within a demographic–I don’t know the stats of it–but I think that people look at porn a lot. I also think that when most people finish looking at porn, they don’t like it. I think once a man, particularly because I’m a man, I know how it feels once you ejaculate, you want to turn that thing off as fast as possible and it’s like, suddenly you’re just disgusted with it and it’s just this presence in your room that you’re ashamed of. You go to great discomfort to turn it off as fast as you can. And it’s not like you’re afraid you’re going to get caught of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s because the idea and the sight of it is appalling after you’re done and I think that’s a real telling sign and I think other people can relate to that feeling. I’m just kind of assuming that’s how other people feel when they’re in that position. I don’t know what is or what that’s doing. I have to explore it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I think a good way to explore a thing like that is to publicly describe it the best you can and then see what other people think.&lt;/span&gt; And so, you know, people disagree with me on that song and a lot of people agree. I’m still not completely sure what to make of the porn industry because I know there’s so much wrong with it, but people should have a right to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, I don’t really have my mind set on a lot of these things and I just want to–&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;questions and music go really well together.&lt;/span&gt; I think answers in music kind of–I can’t think of too many things I would want to write that are telling people the way things are. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Hip hop’s a good medium for telling people the way things are. That’s part of why I love &lt;em&gt;To Pimp a Butterfly&lt;/em&gt; is because every track on Kendrick’s album there kind of contradicts the previous one.&lt;/span&gt; He’ll tell you the way things are, but then he’ll tell you the opposite in the next track. I think that’s a much more human dialogue kind of feeling than an album–you know, it’s an album where I think you can empathize and see where he’s coming from better at the end of it whereas other albums I’ve heard about racism in America, things like that, social inequality, make me feel sort of alienated like I can never understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;This one didn’t make me feel like I can totally understand, but it made me feel like I can understand where Kendrick’s coming from a little better. It’s like one guy closer to being able to empathize with someone else. If an artist can–I think it’s just a great medium for contradictory statements and for questions and believing both sides and leaving things up in the air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/2B-Oe6bnDAE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I totally agree. There’s an album called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_the_Corner_to_the_Block&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Corner to the Block&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by the band &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic&quot;&gt;Galactic &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and every song has a different rapper. I always just liked the drum parts and there are some good hooks and stuff, but, literally, five years after I bought the album I started listening to the lyrics and I was like, “Oh my goodness! This stuff is profound!” As a guitar player, as a Steve Vai fan, as a Zappa fan, lyrics were always like, “Whatever. They kind of decorate the landscape.” But on this stuff, it’s so deep and so when I was listening to your album, which Andy Alt introduced me to you as some sort of guy who won a Steve Vai guitar competition and I heard your music and I’m like, “What does this guy have to do with Steve Vai?” Yeah, but the lyrics are such an opportunity that I don’t think I will ever breach, but I was very curious if there’s a struggle for you or if it’s just like, “No, this is my venue and this is how I do it and I’m much more comfortable doing this than having a conversation about it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: Yeah, I think it makes it easier to have a conversation about it when you know somebody’s heard the song because it’s harder to judge someone when they’re really opening up. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;We’re so afraid of being judged when we open up and become vulnerable but I think as the receiver of that opening up, past a certain age it’s really hard to punch that wound or see someone be that vulnerable and take advantage of it and push them.&lt;/span&gt; But people out there do that and it’s a risk certainly to open up like that, but it’s better to do it, I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Do your parents hear this music and go, “Wow Ben. I never expected this from you?” As a father myself, I’m like, “What if my kids released music like this?” You know? It’s pretty out there and it’s very–it makes a statement. It is not benign music and it’s jarring and disjointed at times in a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; way. I don’t mean that in a negative way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: Yeah yeah. I appreciate those adjectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: But like you said, you exploit the moments where things don’t work and it really does become an uncomfortable experience at times. And listening to the lyrics, it’s even more uncomfortable. Have people close to you, like your parents or a significant other or siblings or anything, had strong reactions to what you do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bjy4xUrHsHQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: Well, my parents are amazingly understanding. Not just understanding, but if I make something in a song, then they take it really seriously and so, I have an album called &lt;a href=&quot;https://benlevingroup.bandcamp.com/album/sea-stories&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sea Stories&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about a sex addict and he’s telling his story to his daughter and she ultimately accepts him for who he is. It’s kind of in the Nick Cave style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s really influenced by the Nick Cave album, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_the_Sky_Away&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Push the Sky Away&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He’s got albums like: “She was a light, I was a match, I was the light that could fire up her snatch.” Lines like that. But, he makes them work. I think that’s really amazing. In &lt;em&gt;Sea Stories&lt;/em&gt;, I have a song called &lt;em&gt;Constellations&lt;/em&gt; and the chorus is like, “Where does Orion keep his belt when he’s humping all those whores. If I was made in God’s image, does he have a thing for whores?” They’ve heard me do this for a while, these kinds of ultra-jarring lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I have an album called &lt;a href=&quot;https://benlevingroup.bandcamp.com/album/freak-machine&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Freak Machine&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and that was the first time I did that kind of thing. The whole thing is sung by Courtney, the girl from Bent Knee who sings. She sings, “My heart says no but my cock says yes” in the first song and she says it with all her might. My mom was like, “Can’t you say, ‘My heart says no but my &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt; says yes?’” That was the only time I think it ever came up that way, but they immediately, once they heard the finished thing, they understood why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/5t0ex229Pkk&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I think they love music too and they love books and they’re in the science and medicine field, so they’re not making music, but they love all that stuff and they understand that’s what part of music’s for. I don’t get crap from them, but this one music video I made for &lt;em&gt;Freak Machine&lt;/em&gt;, in the climax, my pal who stars in it shits out a rainbow and he gets smothered with a pillow that’s a monkey’s head. There’s a bunch of orgy stuff. There’s tons of blood. It’s really gruesome. It’s appropriately gruesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s the right video for that song, but I know a guy who went up to me one time and he was avoiding eye contact with me. I went up to him and I said, “Hi,” because I knew him and I liked him. He was really shy to talk to me and I figured out through the conversation after talking for a while that &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;he saw that video and didn’t understand the story behind it at all and just thought that I was this messed up kind of mean, evil person who would impose this on people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;That was weird because once I told him what it was about–it’s about a guy who shoots himself in the head and he experiences his greatest humiliations and realizes what he’s done as he’s going. It’s about a character so extreme that I hoped other people would be able to look at him and think, “Hey, at least I’m not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; messed up.” It was supposed to cheer some of my friends up who were really lonely. So when I explained the video like that, he was nice to me again and friendly again. That’s only happened that one time, really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Sometimes you give people your best and then they reject you.&lt;/span&gt; I think that’s just a necessary piece of taking much-needed risks. Like you talking in front of all those people and sharing what you’re doing and sharing your heart is really valuable because there’s probably a lot of people who want to know how you’re doing what you’re doing. You’ll give them the courage or the little boost they need to go and do what they want to do. And if people are doing what they want to do, that’s great! You can deny them all of your own greatness at their expense because of the few people who reject your best. Or even if it’s lots of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;One thing I always try to remind myself with making weird music is that if I make weird music, or music that is very specific and maybe not widely appealing but you have to have this certain set of interests to like it, the people who like it feel included in an often-exclusionary social world.&lt;/span&gt; If you’re the guy who gets beaten up in middle school, you hang out with the other guys who get beaten up and that makes it better. If you’re the only person who likes prog, then you go find prog hangouts and they get really close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;The prog community is really close. The metal community is really close. The hip hop community is really close. A lot of underground music scenes are really strong because people combine. So if you’re making super weird music, there’s this chance that you can reach these people who will really love it who, otherwise, no one is really making music for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;When I made &lt;a href=&quot;https://benlevingroup.bandcamp.com/album/life-and-back&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Life and Back&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, before I put it out, I didn’t think anyone would actually like it. It was the first time I ever thought that. I thought people were going to make fun of my rapping and they’re going to think it’s too far and people are going to react like they did with the &lt;em&gt;Freak Machine&lt;/em&gt; video and they’re going to give me crap. It’s actually been more well-received and talked about to me more than most of the things that I do besides Bent Knee. Bent Knee always gets lots of attention because it’s six people working all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I’m glad you picked it up and I have a chance to talk to anybody about it. When I put it out, though, I thought there might be some guy who’s day-to-day ritual is he sits at home and let’s say he’s got diabetes or something. That sucks. Or he has some condition that he can’t run outside and he’s alone, but the one thing he really likes to do is listen to music and this album can be one of the albums that really makes his day worth having.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;That’s always possible and you’d never know if that were the case because: what are the odds of the guy contacting you? Usually that doesn’t happen and you have no idea how many people are actually–maybe the number of views on YouTube or whatever, but &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;you don’t really know how many people in the world are really affected by what you’re doing on the internet. You don’t want to deny those people anything.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Oh yeah. One thing I love about your album is it’s easy to get lost in and I don’t understand it. I don’t mean thematically. I mean you just do so much stuff on there that makes me think about what I do as a musician and it’s so interesting. It’s so thought-provoking musically. It’s really cool to see someone tip-toe-ing to the edge, but it’s not something like several people I’ve talked to–Like Mattias Eklundh was just saying, “I want to be on the right side of weird.” I think you’re on the edge of the right side of weird. It’s not Rock in Opposition or Henry Cow or something like that, it’s its own music and it still fits within those bounds of “this is really creative and really interesting.” But it’s “outside” enough that makes me think it’s another world that I don’t understand and it’s probably part of the roots in hip hop and my exposure to hip hop is too limited, but there’s only so many hours and so many albums. But I can’t wait to check out some of the albums you’ve mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: I just say Kendrick Lamar’s &lt;em&gt;To Pimp a Butterfly&lt;/em&gt; and then &lt;em&gt;Case Closed&lt;/em&gt;. There’s obviously tons more amazing hip hop, but I just think that is the greatest expression of what I like about it and I want to use what I like. Hear where that all comes from for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Well, I thank you so much for your time. It’s really generous to give me so much of your time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: No problem. I appreciate it. It’s really fun for me and I’m glad that music matters to you. I’d love to be able to say that I can put out an album and I know for sure that a lot of people will care, but I never really know for sure. It’s nice when anyone cares. It’s especially nice when someone who cares so much about music cares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: That’s great, man. I can’t wait to talk to you and Bent Knee about the new album. I have so many thoughts and ideas about where you got influences. I could be totally off, but it’s what I hear when I listen to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: You’ll like them. They’re pretty silly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Thank you, Ben!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;B: Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;
