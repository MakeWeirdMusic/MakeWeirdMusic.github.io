&lt;h2 id=&quot;transcription&quot;&gt;Transcription&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several years ago, I was building a Lotus Super 7 replica using a wrecked Mazda Miata donor car and a body kit. After my wife and I had our second child, I had to sell the car due to lack of time. That’s when I said to my wife, “By the time I’m 40, I want to have a home studio and a Lotus Super 7.” Her response was, “You can choose one.” It was a tough choice, but I eventually went with the studio. And in early 2018 at the age of 36, I bit the bullet, got a home equity loan, and got started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my studio and this is the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building a home studio is easily one of the best and most fulfilling things I’ve ever done. Sometimes I sit in here and gaze with childlike wonder over how much I love this private 280-square-foot creative oasis. Part of me knows it’s because of all the literal blood, sweat, tears, and money my friends and I put into it. Part of me knows it’s because I’ve built a place where I can find peace. Part of me knows it’s the ikea effect on a pretty large scale. But the most interesting aspect is what it represents: freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many musicians, I’ve dreamt for years about moving my gear out of a cramped bedroom and into a proper, dedicated creative space. It all started as a teenager when my dad and I built a small studio in my old bedroom using an Alesis ADAT XT, a PowerPC Mac tower with an A/V card, a cheap 8-track Mackie mixer, a CD burner, and a CD stomper. We would track directly to the ADAT, run each output through the Mackie, and print to the stereo inputs on the Mac’s AV card. From there we put the audio files into a CD-burning app called Toast and we were able to get our music into people’s ears quickly and easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We mixed and recorded several albums there, including his musical interpretations of the Mesopotamian story The Epic of Gilgamesh and the Navajo story Big Star Way. I also recorded  my first two “albums” Hansel Vs. Gretel and Mytopia there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a teenager, I saved every dollar I could to buy music gear, including a Johnson Millennium amplifier, several instruments, strings, ADAT SVHS tapes, blank CDs, and CD label stickers. It was an incredible, hands-on learning experience for several years. Then in 2002 I got an internship with Steve Vai and learned how things are done in the big leagues. My dad and I went all-in on Pro Tools after that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I moved out and got married, I still kept a bedroom studio, complete with Tupperware containers full of cables, hard drives, CD spools, and instruments. When my wife and I had kids, I got rid of my amplifiers and got a digital drum kit, which allowed me to record at any hour without waking a sleeping baby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, when I started MWM 5 years ago in 2014, the recording studio also became a video production studio and required a ton more gear, including lights, cameras, tripods, and a backdrop. The site grew and grew, as did my collection of gear, until I just couldn’t fit in a 110 square foot room anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late 2017, after a couple years of discussion, we bit the bullet and decided to build something new in the backyard. We set a budget of about $25K, got a home equity loan, and I worked with my neighbor who runs a construction company. He and I got a design together and spent several months refining and getting through the permit approval process until we finally broke ground in May 2018. We went through every idea from an upgraded Tuff Shed to prefab kits to structural insulated panels to storage containers to tiny houses. I spent hours and hours and hours researching this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live in Arizona where it gets very hot in the summers and fairly chilly in the winters. I also live next to a main road with lots of traffic, so insulation was a major concern. We decided on 2x6 16” on center construction for the walls with R-19 fiberglass batts. We did 2x12” 16” on center for the roof with R-38 fiberglass. I wanted a southwestern-style building with a single sloped roof so I could have a square wall to film against in the back of the building. I wanted to walk into the building and have a rising ceiling to give the illusion of more height and it worked out great. This also had drainage advantages to handle Arizona’s flash-flood rains that could drop several inches of rain in just a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of drainage, we also had to design new drainage flows for the areas surrounding the building. We put in a French drainage system and graded the dirt so water would flow into the French drains. We also added gutters on my house to help with the drainage. The last thing I needed was any chance of flooding or risk to the foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My neighbor and I designed the inside with two zones in mind. The front half would be the entry zone with computing, socializing, and slumber functions. I work from home a lot, we like to have company over, and we frequently have touring musicians looking for a place to stay for a night. The back half of the studio would be the video production zone where I could film and keep gear set up without constantly tearing down and reassembling when I wanted to film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another major consideration was electricity. In the old bedroom studio, I tripped our circuit breaker in the summer pretty regularly because of all the electricity I needed to film at night with lights, computers, and a dedicated air conditioner. That room shared a circuit with our kitchen appliances, so if I drew too much power and my wife used the microwave, it was bad for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a lot of grand ideas in mind when designing this thing. I wanted tons of shelving, everything on wheels, a ramp system outside the house to make it easy to transport rolling gear, and more, but a lot of this was pure fantasy for someone who’d never built something of this scale before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had an in-ground hot tub in the backyard with its own 160-amp circuit and subpanel. We used all that amperage for a dedicated HVAC mini split system and two 15-amp circuits inside the studio. I knew I would primarily use LED lighting and camera gear, so the 30 amps would be overkill, but better safe than sorry. I made sure there were plenty of outlets in the design, so we put in floor outlets, ceiling outlets, and lots of four-gang outlets on the walls. Altogether, I believe there are 52 outlets in the building, as opposed to the 6 outlets I had in the bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We faced several weeks of delays in the permit approval process. We ripped out the hot tub, my neighbor’s company poured a slab, and we framed it very quickly. I spent weeks putting up OSB and plywood sheathing waking up early before the scalding Arizona summer heat would begin. I usually started at 6, would have some meetings from 730 until 8, then I would work more until 9. If I could work through lunch, I would. Then I would work from 5pm until dinner and sometimes after dinner until about 9pm or sometimes later, like until midnight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hours were grueling, but I was incentivized to finish as soon as possible. The quicker I finished, the quicker I could start working out there. I barely published any MWM videos during that time. Plus it was so hot that I just wanted to be done with the project. I almost passed out several times nailing down plywood sheathing on the roof in direct sun that was easily 120 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My kids helped out a lot too and learned on the job. They used a skillsaw, measured wood, and helped out with the fire blocking pieces protecting the roof from risk of fire. They also helped a lot with installing electric wiring and outlets. It was fantastic even though we were all so so hot out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t articulate how difficult and painful the framing process was for me. I hit my thumb so many times that it bled internally under my fingernail. I had dried blood in my thumbnail for at least 4 months. I dropped hundreds of nails when they would bounce out of the OSB sheathing. It was so infuriating that I had emotional breakdowns at least once a week that ended with me smashing 2x12” scraps into pieces with a hammer. I’ve never been so angry at my mistakes as I was in this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the framing was complete, I hired a contractor to install a membrane roof and “dry in” the building. This was a major milestone because I could then leave tools in the building without worrying about weather. Many beers were had to celebrate and enjoy this milestone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another friend helped me with all the electric work and the ceiling lights. I hired a contractor to install the high voltage wiring and subpanel inside the building. He also helped me get my wiring up to code. I learned how to wire outlets and switches on YouTube and used the pigtail method on every outlet, even when it was unnecessary. I loved doing pigtails, cutting and stripping wire, capping everything, and preparing the building for live power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the electric was done, I bought some windows off a friend who was remodeling his home. Then I had another couple of friends help me install them and the doors. They also helped with the insulation installation. This was a very grueling process because our framing wasn’t exact and required a lot of unnecessary cutting of the fiberglass batting. We spent several days working on that. It was painful. Really painful and we worked past midnight for several days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part of the insulation installation was that I could bring my portable air conditioner into the building. Between the windows and the insulated walls, I could keep the room in the 80s as opposed to the 90s or 100s in the weeks prior. This was amazing, although the air conditioner kept filling up with water and I had to drain it almost every hour during the rain season. It was a pain and I eventually just let the water drain onto the floor so I wouldn’t have to drain it manually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step was drywall, which was a bit of a fiasco because I wanted the ⅝” longest sheets possible for the ceiling. I ordered 12-foot sheets from Home Depot and my friend and I installed them with a lift. These sheets are REALLY REALLY heavy. This was easily the most frustrating part of the construction because we kept measuring and cutting incorrectly. We had to buy replacement sheets and it was a huge mess. I still can’t get all the gypsum dust off the floor. I will never do drywall installation on a ceiling again, especially with 12-foot sheets that weigh more than 100 pounds each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make it easier, I bought a tool called a rotozip and it was the greatest tool I’d ever used. The best $80 spent on the whole project, without a doubt. If you are doing anything with drywall, get a rotozip. You will not regret it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned everything about drywall installation on YouTube. I also learned that drywall installation isn’t easy, especially the mud, tape, and texture process. I installed all the drywall on the walls by myself and did not want to deal with the mud and tape. So I hired a local crew and they did a fantastic job. Absolutely fantastic. They made all my flaws disappear. It was stunning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the texture was finished, I started painting the inside and the room came to life. I also hired a crew to put exterior insulation and smooth finish stucco on. This process took a couple of weeks because it’s many coats of concrete and the process requires curing. It was also raining a lot during this time, so it took much longer than I expected for this to get finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all this I was able to hire a guy to install the HVAC system. He did a great job, but the first unit he installed was defective. He also went on a 3-week vacation during all this and I had work travel so it was a real headache coordinating with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of headaches and coordination, dealing with the permit approval process was not easy either. Wow, did I learn a lot through that. Every major step required an inspection and there are only two inspectors for my area. To put this into context, my county has been the fastest growing county in the United States for many years. We have more new construction and building permits than anywhere else in America. And my city of several hundred thousand people only has two inspectors. Those guys visited more than a dozen sites per day and I had to schedule days or weeks in advance. This is a real problem when you’re trying to get something done quickly! Especially when one of them goes on vacation for a couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, it took about four months for the building to be totally usable. By August 2018, I had a “studio opening” party and hired the band Evil Genius to come play. It was an awesome concert and there’s footage of that show on our channel. In March 2019 we finished the installation of the exterior patio, window and door trim, and baseboards. The studio is finally complete (except I have to paint the trim and baseboards). The only thing that remains is metal cap flashing on the parapet wall, and if you know what that means, then you’ll know it’s relatively trivial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost all the tools I used for this project were borrowed from friends and family. Even though I probably built 50-60% of this building, I could not have done it without the guidance, contributions, and talents of many friends. Seriously, I owe it to all of them because I am not a particularly handy person. I have a master’s degree in technology, so most of my expertise is in computer stuff. I learned a ton from them and from YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project helped me to learn about things like crickets and scuppers, UFER grounds, termite treatments and orange tags, pigtails, j-bolts, z-hangers, strong ties, fireblocking, 20 ounce hammers, rotozips, mud rings, and more. I went to Home Depot and Lowe’s 3-10 times per week. I taught my kids how to use power tools. I learned how to best hammer a nail through OSB on a 2x6 frame. I learned how to fail inspections and install windows. I know where every screw and nail and beam are in this building. There is literally still dried blood on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve never felt so free and empowered in my life. This building has taught me that I can do anything I set my mind to. And now I have my own little slice of heaven. It’s not perfect and there are definitely some things I would do differently if I could do it again, but man what an experience. In a day and age where my hands are primarily on computer keyboards, glass touch screens, or guitar strings, to get my hands dirty and bloody was just awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for numbers, here are the basics: the building cost me $25,000, so about $80-100 per square foot, but the real estate market is selling at $150 per square foot and higher in my area. It increased the value of my home significantly. Other people in my neighborhood spent $50K doing similar projects in their yard. The outdoor flagstone patio work was another $10,000, but that can be done much cheaper with concrete or stone pavers. We could have done a lot of things cheaper too, but I didn’t want to compromise much on quality. This is a once-in-a-lifetime type project for me, so we wanted to do it right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re thinking of doing something similar, I want to encourage you to bite the bullet. It’s good for you and it’s good for the world. We need more people who have hands-on experience instead of armchair expertise. More people creating their own destinies instead of waiting for life to happen to them. More people producing than consuming. More doers and fewer intellectual yet idiots. Feel free to reach out with more questions and please share your own studio projects if you’ve made one yourself. Even though I thought this project would be boring for people, there sure has been a lot of enthusiasm so thank you for all your support! You inspired me to finish and share! So thanks for listening to all this. I plan on sharing more about the studio in the future. If you have suggestions of what you’d like to know, let me know in the comments. If you would have chosen the Lotus Super 7 instead of the studio, I’d also like to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Learn San Lorenzo by Pat Metheny and Lyle Mays</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-this-song&quot;&gt;Why This Song?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://patmetheny.com&quot;&gt;Pat Metheny&lt;/a&gt; is an incredible composer and guitarist. I absolutely love a lot of his work (some I definitely don’t!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was asked if I would perform this song with my friend Jonathan Sindelman for his opening act when MWM brought &lt;a href=&quot;/concert/nik-baertsch&quot;&gt;Nik Bärtsch&lt;/a&gt; to Arizona in March 2019. Learning a Pat song sounded fun and interesting. Little did I know what I was getting myself into!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ad&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/san-lorenzo/83913842?i=83913844&quot;&gt;Purchase Pat Metheny’s San Lorenzo on Apple Music &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-apple&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not an easy song to learn. First of all, you need a 12-string electric guitar. Second, you need to play in a non-standard tuning (shouldn’t be a surprise to Pat fans). Third, the non-standard tuning requires a set of custom strings that are all plain steel, except for one. Crazy! Here are the details on the tuning, courtesy of YouTube commenter David Kean:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low to high!&lt;br /&gt;
Eb3 .021w/Bb3 .013   5th&lt;br /&gt;
F3 .018 /C4 .012   5th&lt;br /&gt;
Ab3 .015 /Eb4 .010   5th&lt;br /&gt;
Bb3 .013 /F4 .009   5th&lt;br /&gt;
C4 .012  /G4 .008    5th&lt;br /&gt;
F4 .009/F4 .009   Unison&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no good video of this song on YouTube, so I had to figure it all out by ear. The sheet music wasn’t of much help, either, because the tuning is non-standard, so learning how to read the sheet music in this tuning was like learning a new instrument. While I know I am not playing what Pat plays, this is a good “fake” playthrough that’ll accompany the track well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;video&quot;&gt;Video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the instructional video for this piece.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sara Groves Concert</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Sara Groves is an out-of-the-box thinker in the contemporary Christian music genre. She’s deep and insightful. &lt;a href=&quot;/interview/sara-groves&quot;&gt;Check out our interview with Sara&lt;/a&gt; to find out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We brought Sara to &lt;a href=&quot;http://stilwellpianos.com&quot;&gt;Stilwell Pianos&lt;/a&gt; in Mesa, AZ on January 19, 2019 for a special small show. The footage on this page is from that evening. We are honored and proud to release it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The songs in this video are deeply moving and beautifully performed. While they’re not particularly “weird” and Sara is an outlier on the site, there is still very, very much to enjoy. I’d like to encourage viewers to keep an open mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the 6th episode of Failure to Fracture, a series that highlights my now-20-year struggle to play the hardest song I’ve ever encountered: “Fracture” by King Crimson. Robert Fripp, the composer and guitarist on the track, writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dgmlive.com/diaries/Robert%20Fripp/RF_diary_2016_Nov_30&quot;&gt;“Fracture is impossible to play.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, no wonder! I guess I’ve spent the last 20 years of my life unnecessarily angering my wife with metronome ticks and non-stop atonal picking. 20 years staring at my hands in mirrors and on camera trying to identify minuscule extraneous movements to eliminate. 20 years losing hope in myself as a guitarist. I could have used this insight 20 years ago, Robert! But maybe there’s more to this story. Let’s see what else he writes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“it took a year to bring my practising up to speed, as it were; and four months directly and specifically on Fracture. my Wife had quite enough after a few weeks, so i had to lock the door to the Cellar; where i practice.” [Sounds familiar…]
“to keep Fracture-fit takes 80% of my time and attention. which is too much. and it’s almost improper that a man of 70 should be doing the high-wire every night;
when there’s a younger generation who might take it on!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does it mean when Robert claims “Fracture is impossible?” Clearly it’s “possible” because he has recorded it on more than one occasion and I’ve even seen him perform it. In fact there are recent live recordings of Fracture on King Crimson’s live Vienna and Mexico City releases. So, what’s he talking about?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a collection of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dgmlive.com/in-depth/guitar-craft-aphorisms&quot;&gt;Guitar Craft aphorisms&lt;/a&gt; that shed some light on this topic. If you’re like me and don’t know what an aphorism is, here’s a definition. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphorism&quot;&gt;According to Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, an aphorism is ”a concise, terse, laconic, and/or memorable expression of a general truth or principle often passed down via tradition. Aphorisms are distinct from axioms. Aphorisms generally originate from experience and custom, whereas axioms are self-evident truths and therefore require no additional proof.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, these expressions may only mean something to those who’ve pursued serious study in the ways of Guitar Craft. I do not include myself in this group because my formal study is quite limited. My mostly-self-guided practice gives me a little bit more insight. But because I’ve failed so expertly (and for so long) at playing Fracture, I have attained enough knowledge to allow me some understanding of the aphorisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Guitar Craft aphorisms state:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Begin with the possible and move gradually towards the impossible.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Desperate doesn’t mean hopeless. Hopeless doesn’t mean impossible. Impossible doesn’t mean unnecessary.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Efficiency: as little as possible and as much as is necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;One measure of possible and impossible is the probable.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If we are able to describe the characteristics of the level to which we aspire, our aspiration becomes possible.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;It is not possible for the musician to play music. But, it is possible for the musician to be played by music.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Perfection is impossible. But I may choose to serve perfection.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Sometimes the impossible is necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The artist is a bridge between the possible, the impossible and the actual.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The greater the seeming imperfection, the greater the possible transformation.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The necessary is possible. The optional is expensive. The arbitrary is unlikely.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We are asked to work honourably: honourably = what is possible + 10%; too hard = 1. Two steps beyond hard, rather than one. 2. When determination becomes “grim determination”. 3. When we lose a sense of ourselves.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We do what is possible and allow space for the impossible to enter.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this to say, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Fracture is impossible in the same way climbing Mount Everest is impossible or eating the 72 ounce steak in two hours is impossible.&lt;/span&gt; Fracture is an etude. An athletic feat. I find it fun, engaging, meditative, meaningful, challenging, torturous, and worthwhile all at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/P7R38s9x0Jo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to understand the distinction between impossible and possible. If I believe Fracture is truly impossible, I will fail miserably. This is true for anything difficult. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;If I believe Fracture is incrementally possible, I will have a different aim. I always have the choice between torture and joy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve Ball shared the following story about his first college math teacher, who said, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;“If a problem is too hard, no one will take it on. If a problem is too easy, no one will take it on.” Aspiring to learn and play Fracture is a ‘too hard’ problem that only one with confidence, determination and willingness to sacrifice all that is required can master the speed, precision, agility, mobility, tone and endurance required.&lt;/span&gt; Steve’s story doesn’t leave room for ignorant people like me who don’t know what they’re getting themselves into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My view toward the impossibility of Fracture has shifted over the years. In my youth, I was driven by ego and a misguided sense of personal value. Either Fracture was impossible to play or I was a failure as a guitarist. Now I know better and am driven by a means of knowing myself, discovering subtle flaws, and relating my hands to an instrument through the action of playing music. My 20-year effort toward playing Fracture is a measure of my available will to master the piece. It was just this week that I identified inefficiencies in my picking. I am still learning every time I pick up the guitar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;So yes, Fracture is impossible. This is by design. And it’s designed as a horrendously steep mountain that may only be scaled via persistent, focused, daily climbing, one small step at a time. The point is not to get to the top of the mountain because it rises into the clouds. The point is to keep moving up the mountain in small steps each day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those looking to understand more about this, there’s is a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fripp.com/frippvt/robert-frippvt-live/&quot;&gt;virtual training program available via Robert’s sister’s website, Fripp.com&lt;/a&gt;. Look for the Robert Fripp virtual training program. You can learn more about craft, mastery, and discipline on your own time directly from speeches by Robert. Let us know in the comments if you check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also suggest watching the documentary “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiro_Dreams_of_Sushi&quot;&gt;Jiro Dreams of Sushi&lt;/a&gt;” for analogous lessons in this journey to Fracture. I’ve watched the film several times and have taken many notes while watching. It’s an amazing film about mastery, repetition, and awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I want to thank the many people who’ve emailed and commented about this series. I can’t believe how many people are climbing this mountain with me around the world and have been paying attention to my efforts all these years. There’s plenty more to this series, so stay tuned. Leave a comment or send an email if you have ideas for the next episode.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Six Demon Bag by Man Man</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;video&quot;&gt;Video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/FS61hOaUILM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creatively-uninhibited-with-white-war-paint-all-over&quot;&gt;Creatively Uninhibited with White War Paint All Over&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend Rosemary was always on the cutting edge of new music. She frequently exposed me to stuff that I never would have heard of, like Kings of Convenience, American Football, Of Montreal, Badly Drawn Boy, and lots of other bands. One day in 2006 she sent me an mp3 of a song called “Engrish Bwudd” by a band called Man Man and I was completely stunned within the first few seconds of listening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/wurEDf8z9tc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was from an album called “Six Demon Bag” and it was like a wonderful, actually-enjoyable blend of Captain Beefheart, Tom Waits, Squirrel Nut Zippers, and circus music. I loved everything about it. The carnival-esque feel, the very-multi-layered vocals, the bouncy minor keys, the nonsensical lyrics, the strange percussion, and especially the live roomy sound of the record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole album was a treat to my ears and unlike anything I’d ever heard before. Truly unique, fun, and musical, which is a rare combination. Every single song on this album is great and seriously so fun to listen to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The band members had the greatest pseudonyms, too. The singer goes Honus Honus. The drummer is Pow Pow. The bassist is Sergei Sogay. Others include Blanco, Les Mizzle, G. Clinton Killingsworth, and San Bañon Pisto. Anyway, I caught them on tour and they were mind-blowing. It was a huge band, probably like 7 people, with a mountain of gear and the whole band wore all-white tennis clothing with white war paint on their faces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/dfmKW4BSw5w?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I saw them three times, each time in a successively larger venue with successively larger groups of hipster teenagers “dancing” rambunctiously right in front of the stage. Man Man always put on an excellent show, but the crowds spoiled it for me and I stopped going to see them. I’m just a cranky old man, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After buying “Six Demon Bag,” I bought their first album, “The Man in a Blue Turban with a Face.” It was also excellent, real creative but with less sophisticated songwriting. Then their third album, Rabbit Habbits came out, which is seriously entirely excellent. Great, great songwriting and totally uninhibited. Another excellent album that probably would have dropped my jaw just as quickly as Six Demon Bag did. The song “Harpoon Fever (Queequeg’s Playhouse)” is a real brain-twister. Probably my favorite on the album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z2rilJ-Wlr4?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following albums never really grabbed me, but I think it’s time to give them another chance. They actually released some new music in late 2018 and performed a few shows. Hopefully this is a sign of things to come! If you’re a fan of Man Man, let me know what I’m missing. If you check them out because of this video, let us know your thoughts in the video comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interview-transcript&quot;&gt;Interview Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Devin Townsend is an artist based in Vancouver, British Columbia in Canada and I am really honored to be here because you are the most requested person to be interviewed on the site and it’s so cool to finally be with you after listening to your music for probably 20 years. So thanks a lot for joining us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: Thanks man, it’s nice to be here. I appreciate being invited onto this, actually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: I appreciate it. So, for people who might be new to you, can you give a brief introduction to yourself and the kind of music you produce?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: Sure. My name’s Devin Townsend. I’m a 46-year-old Canadian musician. I guess my bread and butter has been hard rock and progressive heavy metal. I’ve got maybe about 30 records now through certain bands. I had Strapping Young Lad when I was younger, which was really heavy, and Devin Townsend Project had a whole gaggle of solo records of different styles and aesthetics. I’ve worked with a lot of people. My first thing was with Steve Vai in 1993 and I’ve worked with a lot of people since then. I’ve done a lot of productions for bands in varying degrees of success and I’ve toured and played for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Everywhere, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: Pretty much. Some places more than others. But it’s been a long and confusing career and I am happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: That’s awesome. So, even on your website you talk about how you have HevyDevy Records because you “make weird music.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: And you needed a place to release it. Those are your exact words. Can you talk a little about what makes you feel like your music is unique or different and why you might need a vehicle for you to release it on your own?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: The record label started inadvertently as I couldn’t convince the labels at the time that what I was doing was viable commercially, for one, but also for the level of capital I would need to pull off. So, because the Steve Vai record had done well in Japan, Sony Japan suggested that if I just incorporate a name of whatever the name was, it dubiously ended up being HevyDevy Records, then they would license the work. That’s how it started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;When I put together Strapping Young Lad and that ended up on the label Century Media, if I could make any claim to business acumen, it was that I insisted that the only thing they had rights to was Strapping. Then, everything else that I did, whether or not it was ambient or country or rock or orchestral—anything., I would have the rights to do that on HevyDevy records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Why do I think it’s weird? I don’t think it’s weird, I just think I’m told it’s weird, so I just preface most conversations with preemptively telling people that “you may not dig this” or “people are typically confused about this” or what have you. But I think for me, it’s musically I don’t think about what I do, I guess. I’ve never really thought about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I go by what I’m compelled to do and those compulsions tend to be very vision-based and super specific. So, I’ll do things because that year seems to have certain aesthetics that play into it, like I’m interested in green and I’m interested in this particular font. I’m interested in this particular sound and this frequency and a particular guitar sound, which leads me to another guitar pickup and then by the end of the year, all of these subliminal clues tend to triangulate to the point where there’s a really specific vibe that a name typically happens in the formative stages of those clues coming together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;By the end, I’m like, “Oh, I guess it’s Ki.” “Oh, I guess it’s Ziltoid.” “Oh, I guess it’s Empath.” And I’m sometimes like, “Oh that’s weird.” But I knew it had to be that way, I know it has to sound that way, but I’d be first in line to suggest that it’s strange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: One of the main reasons I wanted to talk to you is because of this book. You wrote a book on creativity. Can you give a little background on the book?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: I think part of the process that I have been working towards my own ability to actualize ideas is: how do you refine your creative spirit to the point where what your intention is is unclouded by any of the crap that you’ve put into your body or you ingest with media or other people’s music or whatever? That requires a lot of exploration, whether or not that means I’m a vegetarian. I’m a vegetarian for years and I’m like, “Well, why am I a vegetarian? Eat meat and figure it out.” Then I eat meat and it makes me feel the way that it did and then I’m vegetarian again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But it’s like I think that on a creative level a lot of what prevents me from being just a pure channel to what it is emotionally I’m trying to represent is my sense of self or my insecurities or my ego or whatever. I think that writing the book ultimately was an extension of being afraid of giving things away, whether or not it’s my guitar sound or my production process or what it is that I—what my reasons are personally, spiritually, whatever. I think I held on to those things for a long time because my insecurity is like, “Well, if other people know how I do what I do, then they’re going to be able to do it and I’m going to be out of a job and I’ll go broke and and…” Whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, I think a couple years ago when the suggestion to come up with the book on creativity came up around, there was a part of me that felt that if I was really forthcoming with the process, then there’s a certain part of the burden of protecting that, that you can forget it all. Like, “Here’s my guitar sounds.” “Here’s how I produce my vocals.” “Here’s how I do it all.” And then through it, I think what I recognized is that what makes what I do unique is the same thing that would make what you do unique or what you do unique or what anybody does unique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s got very little to do with your process and more to do with how that process interprets your trip, which no one else is going to be able to articulate. So more people that have it, the better music I think ultimately will become.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: There are a few interesting themes in your book. One I want to talk about is you talk quite a bit about the subconscious and you’re kind of discovering something that’s already there. And you almost make it sound like “it just happened to me. I didn’t make it. This is already there.” And even the terminology you use is often work-related in terms of perhaps an archaeological dig or you’re massaging something. I was curious if you think—why are there so many references to old things? What are you digging up? What are you excavating? What are you trying to bring to light? Is that stuff that’s been there your whole life? Did it already exist? Where are you coming from with that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: Well that has nothing to do with me. I think it has nothing to do with any artist. I’m often critical in the sense of artists who claim that the work that they do is anything other than just trying to do an accurate version of the manpower to honor the source than it has anything to do with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;As a person, I think I’m lost and simple. So, I can only hope that the moments that I’ve had in my life of spiritual significance—no religion, but spiritual significance—are such where I’m like, “Well, that’s the only thing that I want to represent. That’s the only thing I want to sing about. That’s the only thing I want to get right.” But it’s not that my version of that is, by any stretch of the imagination, “the version” of it. It’s just middle class white Canadian male named Devin. You have a glimpse of these things, as we all do, artistically and we’re like, “Oh, that. Well, through my filter and through my biases and my fears and my hangups and the fact that I liked Judas Priest when I was a kid, or Enya, or any of these things,” it’s that that comes through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And it is ancient. That’s primordial and I think that improvisation and artists who strive to represent these things with reverence, you have to be proactive in calling yourself out on your own bullshit. I think that for me, my reasons for doing that are not because if I do that, I’ll become more successful or I’ll become famous or what have you, it’s just that it seems like the source and those sorts of fundamental human experiences are worthy of that sort of self analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Do you feel like you just trip over it? You trip over it and it just happens to you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: Holy crap, yeah. Not only that, but I don’t understand it until I’m on it, so I often fear it, which is super counter-productive to the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: What specifically do you fear?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: I fear that I’m not capable of handling it. Right? I feel like unless I keep my attention rooted in something that’s fundamentally productive and fundamentally helpful, as opposed to destructive, then it’s going to be skewed and it’s going to be colored by my own ego in a way that misrepresents something that is larger than us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I struggle with insecurity because I don’t know what I’m doing and I don’t claim to be particularly adept at any aspect of what I do. The things that I like in life, you know like my family and I like food and I like sex. You know, the fundamental parts of life are all that I really feel that I can enjoy and there is a passion that is just so rooted in fear that the process becomes, “Okay well face your fears” on some level. If it’s vegetarianism or if it’s sex or if it’s peering into the void or if it’s any of these things, it’s…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;In the past, I had experimented with a lack of accountability with writing as part of the process of trying to actualize my own connection to creativity. I thought, “Well, maybe that’s an avenue to explore.” So this record, “Alien,” and “Infinity” and these things were all based in me going, “Well, I don’t care how people perceive this.” But then through that is a real sense of, “Well, it’s all connected.” Like, everybody’s interconnectedness is part and parcel of how you approach this. Your awareness of where your throw extends will ultimately affect how ably you are to articulate this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I struggle with it because it’s such a compulsion. It’s not like, “Oh I’ve got a good idea. I’ll write a record like this.” It’s just all signs start pointing to certain things, like Empath, this new project. Years ago, I was like, “Okay, well it’s got something to do with covers of those old new age things with the whales underneath and the universe up on the top and the font is something like Star Trek.” You know what I mean? It’s like all these things, the pieces start to fall into place and then by the end of it, I think I’ve recognized in the past by going down avenues that were in hindsight rooted in arrogance or selfishness that I thought that led me to that place, which was horrible for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I don’t want to represent that. It’s much to the chagrin who had something invested in that. Like people in bands that I was with, we were just on the cusp of success or what have you. The last band, The Devin Townsend Project, I was so afraid of the dark that is part of being human that I refused to acknowledge that it was a big part of what balances my creativity. As a result, that band started getting this reputation of being like, “Oh it’s a positive thing.” Then people would come to me like I had answers to some degree, like, “Oh, you know what to—“ You know? “Because you’re saying it, everything’s going to be okay.” I’m like, “But it isn’t!” You know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Then all of a sudden, I started looking down the trajectory of what that would become because the next stage for DTP was more success and more success. I’m like, “My God, I’m going to end up representing something that I’m not qualified to represent. I don’t have the fucking answers. Not even slightly.” And not only that, there seems to be very clearly a market for not only telling people, “Fuck the world” because to be able to rationalize that with a cool logo, there’s a lot of people that are willing to pay for that because it removes that need to say, “No, don’t fuck the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And conversely, saying “Everything’s going to be fine.” There’s a huge market for that because everything’s not, clearly, okay. People want that sort of reassurance and to have it as a slogan on a shirt, all these things, and so I started recognizing, I’m like, “Well again, your fear is preventing you from representing your truth. Your truth. Not the truth. Your truth. My truth is somewhere in the middle, as it should be. My truth is: everything’s clearly not alright, but I firmly believe that if you’re willing to work and recognize that even though there’s darkness everywhere, it’s up to us to find the joy in that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Even with the awareness of that, not blocking out the awareness that it is fundamentally chaos, with a certain type of internal discipline I think you can transmute that into something that is healthy and enjoyable. I’d like to be a step in the latter as opposed to the other. You know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: There are themes in the book, and we were discussing before filming, this notion of via negativa where you are cutting away at things instead of building something up. You use via negativa in a few ways. When you are talking about things not working out in the world, are you using your art to chip away at that? Or are you using art to shine a light on that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: Certainly not intentionally. That’s where sometimes I feel like the imposter syndrome on some level because if you get it right, or at least I feel if I get it right artistically, in hindsight it looks intentional. But it wasn’t. It was all based in just staring into the darkness. Take these things that present themselves purely as an interest and then just have them not irritate me anymore. When I have a piece of music come into my head, it’s finished when it doesn’t bug me. It’s not that it’s—when I start a piece of music, it’s not like the intention of this is going to be for this and that and this is how it’s going to help and this is how it’s going to—it’s got nothing to do with that and I think that’s why I spend so much time being self-deprecating as well because I’ll have these ideas that seem to be of a lot of depth and importance to me and my trip, yet I don’t understand them until they’re done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Can you give an example of something you didn’t understand until it was done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: All of it. All of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Something a little more tangible?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: Yeah. Empath. It’s taken me a year and a half to write it and I consciously went into writing heavy music again for this one, but juxtaposed by very mellow music. It’s the first time I’ve done it in one place. The fear of doing that for fear of people interpreting that or the ups and downs of it, psychologically being disturbing to people was such that I couldn’t trust that my intentions for it were not self-destructive. You know? On some level I was trying to sabotage myself because of the self-loathing or whatever that on some—because I don’t feel like… It’s not like I’m not in control of it, but because of the peripherals are so close, I don’t see it as it’s going. I was like, “Oh my God, what am I doing? What am I doing? What am I doing? This is terrible. This is terrible. This is terrible. It’s great. It’s great. It’s great. This is terrible. It’s terrible. It’s terrible.” But then once it was done and I listened to it, I’m like, “Oh it’s beautiful!” Like your intentions all along were to represent that life is not one thing. Life is all these things. And the last piece of music from the record, the last line is, “If you can’t shine for you, please shine for me.” It’s like, through the storm of the record, what was kind of guiding my hand like an infant was this sense that if you really want to contribute to music, to other people, other people’s art and other people’s frames of mind in a very destructive time, you can’t be oblivious to the fear. You can’t block it out under the assumption that it will simply go away. You have to face it. So by the end of the record, when I finally concluded that I was able to listen to it and say, “This is a positive statement.” It’s a very uneasy time and therefore, as somebody who’s empathetic to what’s going on just in his immediate environment, let alone the media and all the shit we’re bombarded with, of course it’s going to come out like that. Of course it’s going to come out like that. Unless you’re being dishonest, of course it’s going to come out like that. And your fear of other people interpreting it in the wrong way is based on the fact that you’re not a terrible person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: It’s interesting how you view—it seems like you live with this juxtaposition of order and chaos. An album is essentially order. The recording is ordered, everyone’s recorded, the mix is perfect, the master is perfect, but you’re pointing and saying, “There’s still the chaos.” You’re saying, “I don’t know what happens, I don’t know why this happens.” But you have a 5-step guide to creativity, you know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: I think the 5-step guide is based on very pragmatic, almost parental, advice because any advice that I have to people to—“wield” sounds too pompous, but to “handle” this type of process, is like—you know, “Don’t do drugs and stay in school!” You know? It’s really a lot more about when these moments of darkness and existential trauma comes into your life, it’s about practicing real fundamental parts of being a decent person so that your heart is bigger than your fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Do you feel that you’ve worked through a lot of this with your art? Do you feel like you’re a much healthier person of who you were, or do you feel like you have different issues?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: Different issues! I want to be healthy, for sure. I think that I’ve made a lot of inroads in my personal life where I couldn’t have gone into very self-destructive. For example, drugs are a very tender subject because a lot of the times the inspiration you get from cannabis or alcohol or LSD or ayahuasca or any of these things are such that it’s really enticing because you think on some level it removes fear and you’re able to just produce. However there’s a certain aspect of that that it feels like you’re taking it out of the bank. You know? You make a withdrawal that allows you to get a riff or something like this, but you pay for it in a psychological type of chaos that I think disallows you from being able to handle the ramifications of what it is that you’re producing. So, it’s a very fine line. I think that extends to coffee and exercise and all these things, but you’ve gotta live too. It’s not like you can be a monk in this world. If you’ve got kids and if you’ve got a job and you’ve got phones and you’ve got—you’re recycling, yet you’re drinking out of plastic bottles. All these things. I think what that comes down to in the same way, maybe some artistic avenues can lead you to dark places, I think the idea you’ve withdrawn everything from and being completely like, “I’m a pure vessel,” is also a type of hangup and I think what you’ve really got to do is foster some sort of sense of self-love that is rooted in, “Just give me a fucking break, man. Eat a piece of chocolate, dude.” You know what I mean? I think that that ultimately plays into the book as well because what works for one person is not going to work for everybody else. There’s some people I know that can do drugs all the time. Or drink alcohol. Or do any number of things that may not work for other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: It may not be working for them, either. You just think it does watching them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: Maybe, but I think that maybe it predisposes that there’s “one way.” I’m not sure that I subscribe to that. I think that there’s one way ultimately, but I think that there’s very much the idea that everybody has a certain level of evolution and then, for example, I could remove everything from my life. I can become a monk and I can do all these things that seem to be enticing. I just don’t know if I’m spiritually evolved enough for that to not be a waste of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: After seeing some of your performances, I’m not sure you’d be authentic to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: That’s just it! The whole purpose of the guide to creativity, if there is such a thing, is that you’ve gotta figure out who you are and what your parameters are and then honor that, but don’t lie to yourself about it. Sometimes the best thing that you may be able to do for yourself is have a glass of wine and watch Netflix for two days. You know? Maybe it isn’t. Maybe for somebody else, that would be super destructive. But I’m pretty far from enlightenment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: You say the first step is to figure out who you are. Would you say that these things you’re describing about yourself is what you’ve figured out about who you are or are they kind of something else?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: I’ve figured them out only because I’ve been so afraid of life. In trying to not be perpetually immobilized by fear, these things have kind of revealed themselves to me as opposed to any sort of benevolent, like, “I think that my role in life is to…” I’m shit scared all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Is the music a vehicle to process that? Or is it a way of blocking it out for you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: Music started as a loophole for me because we were raised in an environment where overt displays of emotion were viewed as distasteful, I think. I think that the downfall of that within my family is there’s a lot of people who have not a very highly evolved empathic, but moderate. And I’m in that category, so you can’t feel the need to understand emotions or to represent emotions with such primal ferocity without a loophole for it to come out if you’re in an environment where it’s not cultivated or else you’re going to go fucking crazy. For me, because music—I’ve always been, I guess synesthesic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: The neuroscientist would know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: I mean, numbers and colors and shapes and sounds and emotions are really connected, right? As a result of that, it could have been music, it could have been art. It didn’t really matter. Music was just a loophole. Because I was in a musical family, I could represent those sort of repressed things in a way that wasn’t going to get me in trouble and then when I found that it became a convenient place for me to put it, everything kind of got hardwired to that. And so now as I find myself, and this one could argue that I’m learning these lessons that I’ve imposed on myself are helping, or I’m just getting older. But music and its importance to me in terms of my identity is much less than it was. So now I find that, for example on Empath, a lot of the theme ended up again at the end being recognized as: what you’re trying to do is let these things come and not let them define you. Let them bubble to the surface and then let them go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Which is something you cover in the book where you say, “Don’t spiritualize or idolize the idea. Just commoditize it and record it, have a system for storing it, and you’ll get back to it later.” It’s not like, “Oh crap, if I don’t work on this, my life will fall apart.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: So if I can add a caveat to that: if you want to. I think as soon as you say you don’t or one method is or “this is how you do it,” I think it verges on the same problem I have with religion where it predisposes that whoever’s telling you these things knows. I will be the first to say, “I don’t know and what I thought I knew tends to morph from year to year.” When I was experimenting with eating meat again, I had all these people in my life that were hardcore vegan and they were hyper-critical of me. I was like, “Yeah, but I don’t know. I’ve been vegetarian for so long, I don’t even know why I’m vegetarian. I just need to know.” It was like, “Well you can’t.” I’m like, “But why? It just seems stupid.” And I mean, the truth is somewhere in the middle for me. I realize that by allowing myself the lack of judgment that goes into saying, “If you choose to try something, that makes you a terrible person. You’re going to hell.” Or whatever it is. I find that’s been really helpful creatively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: This book is kind of all about that, like this notion of everyone has their own truth and popular society may not be interested in yours. But if pleasure and artistic expression is the goal, you’re going to have to get over that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: Yeah. Yeah. I think it really comes down to: just be honest with yourself and it doesn’t matter if what you want is something that isn’t “right” to want. Maybe all you want to do is make a ton of money, but if that’s what’s going to make you happy, then you’d be foolish not to pursue that because maybe somewhere along the line you’ll find that in the path of that is what you needed to know. It’s like, “Oh, that isn’t going to make me happy. But I didn’t know it was not going to make me happy until I went there.” I think that it’s like Bart Simpson testing the electric muffin. He’s like, “Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.” I feel like to a certain extent, my process is like “I just need to try it to know.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Well now that you’re a millionaire, you know if that money isn’t that important to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: I’m a “thousandaire.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Right on. Me too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: I mean, I think money is a pain in the ass. I would love to have enough money to never have to say “no” to the guacamole, as they say. I know a bunch of people who have millions of people and they just seem like they have so many problems. I feel like I’ve got, in a lot of ways, more than I need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: I heard a great saying the other day. It’s a Chinese proverb/adage type thing. “No food, one problem. Lots of food, many problems.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: That makes sense. That makes sense. But I think, again, I think where the problems come there is thinking, “Well that’s what you have to do, then. So I’m going to get rid of everything and I’m going to get a white cloak and I’m going to tell my family that I’m the Buddha and I’m going to go off and…” But if you’re not spiritually in that place, all you’re doing is fucking yourself and everybody else that you care about. I think that’s a really important thing because during Infinity, I went down that path where I was like, “I’m going to get rid of everything and I’m going to go be a monk.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Is that why you’re naked on the cover?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: Totally. But it’s like, “But I’m not evolved enough for that.” It’s like I’m kind of stuck in the western view of what spirituality is to the point where I think there’s a way that you do it. You know? If I got more than one guitar, then I’m spiritually unevolved and I find that a lot of my problems with spiritualism or religion, but spiritualism in general, is people thinking that–for example, I know a lot of people who are vegetarian because that’s what spiritual people do. But then I know a lot of people that seem really spiritually evolved that eat meat. You know? So when you feel like you just have to have the uniform for what’s going to–you’re going to transcend the birth and death cycle, you’re going to go to heaven, whatever it is. You think, “Well as long as I’ve got these things, I say ‘namaste’ a lot and I do a lot of yoga and I still talk shit about my buddies when they’re not around.” I think ultimately, it’s like, “Man you’re wasting your time. Just figure out what you want to do. Burn around in a race car and eat ribs. If this is your one time around, then maybe that’s what you should be doing.” As opposed to just being frustrated with everything. Now, I think the other side of the coin now is the further down you go, certain things just don’t make sense anymore. Like for me, I love meat, but after a while it’s like, “Well that just doesn’t make sense for a number of reasons.” But I needed to know that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: I like Robert Fripp’s way. He has a couple of ways of thinking about this. First he says that Tai Chi shows the perfect form exists and it’s your job to align with that form. Whatever that form is, may be different for different people, but we need to build the discipline to be able to take that form. And then he calls King Crimson “a way of doing things.” And I always thought, “That is so irritating. What does that mean?” But just like you’re saying, it’s like, “This is how I process what I need to do. This is my way of doing things.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: I thought you were going to say, “Just like what you’re saying is irritating.” [Laughs.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah, can we move on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: Yeah, I’ll choke now. No, I get it, man. I think it’s like–I like my friends, I like my family, I don’t claim to know a lot, I like laughing, I like eating. I don’t know. I don’t know. And I know less every day. So I think that the creative thing frightens me just because I clearly do know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: You do!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: And that’s the thing where there’s a disconnect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: You can’t not know after 30 years of it, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DT: This is the problem! So because of the real disconnect between chaos and order that even exists within my creative mind, I constantly feel ill at ease about what I do and that prevents me from improvising in the way that I hope to one day. You know? I think that once I can make–and I think it comes down to insecurity. I spent so many years going, “Oh I’m an idiot. I don’t know.” You internalize that to the point where you clearly do know and it’s like, “Oh no I don’t.” [Inaudible.] “I don’t know.” Right? But maybe this whole mid-life thing, I mean 46 is pretty late to still be battling with this shit, but whatcha gonna do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interview-transcript&quot;&gt;Interview Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: I want to talk about this instrument briefly, too, because you just got it yesterday and it’s just gorgeous. What is this? Can you hold it up?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: Sure, so this is the prototype of this signature acoustic guitar that I’m working on with this Vancouver company, Prestige. I’ve got a very close relationships with the companies that I work with and I’m very loyal to the brands. Same thing that keeps me married for so long. I know what I want and then once I get it, that’s what I want. I don’t want to go look for something else. I’m good!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: One and done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: One and done. I started with Peavey and I had an idea for a guitar, but we couldn’t pull it off together for financial and just the logistics. Peavey is a company that has to sell things at a certain price point. We couldn’t produce it for what I wanted. So I went to Framus and they said, “We’ll do exactly what you want and you can take all the time you need.” So I came up with this guitar with them called the Storm Bender, which is exactly the guitar that I want. I got to design the body, I got to design the pickups, I got to design…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: This is new? The Storm Bender?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: I’ve been working on it for three years, but it was released last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Okay, I thought so. All right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: I took it on tour for two years and then refined it. Little things. Like, this cut here is bugging me, the pickup selector needs to be here as opposed to there, the tilt of the neck–because I want it to be a maple top with mahogany and I want it to be a set neck, but I want the cutaway to feel like a thru, but I want it to sound like a set, I want it to be thicker, I want it to be heavier, and when I lay it on the ground, I want the headstock to not touch the ground because I’m gonna step on it. You know what I mean? And they did it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: All the things you design a guitar for. [Laughs.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: The reason it is is it’s like, unless I can get it exactly like that, I’ll just use a guitar that is currently being produced. Some people are saying, “Okay, well, you’re doing a signature guitar so you can make money.” However, the Framus guitar, the list price on those are like 10 grand, so no one’s going to fucking buy it. So I made it because that’s what I want. I had talked to other companies and it was like, “Well if you do it cheaper, if you do it this way, then you’ll make money.” But I was like, “Yeah, but I want the guitar.” You know what I mean? [Laughs.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: You’re not born for this industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: No I’m not, but luckily my relationships with these people are such that I get what I need. And so I talked to Hans-Peter [Wilfer] at Framus and I was like, “There’s a Vancouver company called Prestige who I met in an elevator at NAMM and they’re just down the street from me and I’d like to do a signature acoustic with them.” I know that Framus does acoustics, but they’re willing to do the same way that you did the Storm Bender. They’re willing to do exactly what I want for an acoustic guitar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So this guitar here, long story long, is the prototype of it. Don’t have a name for it yet and this isn’t, obviously, exactly right yet, but I’m doing a bunch of acoustic touring this year to sort of not only get out there again, but also use it as an opportunity to do Q&amp;amp;As and sort of talk about the process so that when I do start touring again in November, it’s prefaced. So what I did with this was I wanted a certain thing, like I wanted a folk music type of guitar, like Gordon Lightfoot and all these sorts of things that I grew up with, which is a dreadnought shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But little things, like I like the dreadnought shape, but I do like to play up high and so I wanted a cutaway and I wanted the tourified top, which is baked so basically it removed a lot of the moisture and speeds up the aging process. I wanted the ebony fretboard, I wanted these certain type of tuners, and there’s now this guitar. Even as I’m playing it, there’s a few things about it that immediately I know we’re going to change, but they as well have now given me a year. Just like, “Okay, take it on tour and don’t hold back. Tell us exactly what you mean.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I’m thinking first off I’d like this cut a little more, I’d like this heel to not be as pointy, I might want to change the radius from a 14 to a 12, but it allows me by the end of it to have the acoustic guitar. It’s not at that point, “Well I’ll go into my selection of acoustic guitars and take the one that’s best for the song.” It’s like, “No. That one.” Because my reasons for efficiency in what my instruments are is because the process requires me to move super fucking quick, so I don’t want to think about whether or not this is going to work. It’s gotta be right, it’s gotta be in tune. The Evertune, that’s perfect for me because it’s like I’m always in tune.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: This guitar is beautiful. It sounds great. It feels great. I love the texture on the top, too. Like, the feel, the smell, everything. I just loved it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: And it’s indicative of my Vancouver-ness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: With the maple leaves?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: Yeah that’s a little thing. We were talking about this. When they release the actual guitar, each one of them–we had this kind of a cool idea. They’re going to have a little tab that sticks up out of the sound hole that I’m going to do a letter, so each one of them is going to have its own letter. So when you pull it, it’ll be like, “Okay, well that’s this one.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Your little love note to that guitar itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: Yeah. But I think it’s important, too, because the relationship to an instrument is where the songs are. I worked with ESP, I worked with Peavey, both of which were really great and generous companies to me. But what their objectives were were a lot more based in the commercial side of things where, “If we do it like this, we can make a decent instrument and we can make money.” But for me, I’m like, “I don’t need a lot of money. I just need my place, I need my kid to go to school, and I need the tools for me to do my job. I don’t want more tools than what I need. I don’t want more plugins than what I need. I just want the fastest way for me to do my thing so I can go on vacation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah, that’s awesome. Thanks for sharing that. I want to say thank you for playing at the concert at NAMM. I’m a sponsor of the concert with Julie and Rodney Cord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: Oh they’re really nice people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: They’re great people it means a lot to all of us who have worked on or in some way contributed to this show. So I appreciate you doing that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: Absolutely. I hope people come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: I think it’s going to be awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: It’s the first–well, I guess the second now because I’ve got the CBC thing, but the first opportunity I’ll have to sort of represent this new phase of my life-slash-career by just doing acoustic on stage with the Fractal [Axe FX II]. I think like attracts like ultimately. Again, I think that’s why intention’s so important because I think you gotta know whether you’re full of shit and it’s really easy, at least for me, to convince myself that I’m not when I actually am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: That’s how we go through every single day, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: Right! I’m like, “Oh that’s what I meant! That’s totally what I should be doing!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: I should be making more, I should be doing more, I should be weighing less…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: That’s the thing. Just even to finish off that statement. When we were talking about the difference between being a monk and being a father in western Canada, you may have to sacrifice some of your spiritual aspirations just for the fact that you live here. This is what your curriculum is. This is where you’re at. It’s like, I’m not just going to ditch the family because, “Well this way I’ll be able to ascend spiritually.” I’m like, “Get out of here. I’ve got a kid and I’ve got fucking braces,” and your wife’s like, “What happened to the fucking banana boy over there?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: And everyone hates you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: I’m okay with that! [Laughs.] But, I think it’s like you commit to something and you’ve gotta see it through in the most–you know, find a compromise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: That’s right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: That’s what I’m hoping to do with my creative versus my paranoid mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: I’ll be looking for you at NAMM with a banana.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: Haha, Peter caught me twice with a banana…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: I saw you with a banana at NAMM a couple years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: Really?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah, we walked right by each other. It was pretty funny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: Maybe I’ve got such a…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: It’s a thing! It’s a meme!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: [Inaudible.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: All right, I’ve got some quick questions before you go. Who are your favorite female artists?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: Musically?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Whatever. A lot of the music that we discuss on the site is male-dominant. Metal, very male dominant. So I want to hear–actually this question comes from someone who submitted the question. So, we want to hear your favorite female artists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: I don’t know if I think about it like that. I mean–sexism is so dumb. It’s like–I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: We can cut it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: It’s all right. I think it’s a good question. I listen to this ambient artist, Meg Bowles, all last year. I know nothing about her, but I assume because her name is Meg, she’s a female. I struggle with male artists in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Do you listen to much? Are you listening to anything now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: It’s all ambient music. I don’t know what it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: The guy falling asleep on the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: Just [makes a note]. But I don’t know who does it or what the name of it is. I just put on Spotify ambient stuff and just–you know I’m looking for watercolors in the background rather than something that pulls me in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Right. Very interesting. Do you have a most surprising song of your own?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: That I’ve written?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: That you’ve written. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: I don’t think anything that I’ve written surprises me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Will there be an Ocean Machine 2?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: I doubt it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Oh, you mentioned Vai is playing on this new record, too. Someone wanted to know what’s next with you and [Steve] Vai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: Steve contacted me. Okay, going back in time, I did vocals on his last record on that last song and he really enjoyed that. So I suggested, because he doesn’t really jam, and I do but not as much as I should. I said, “Oh we should just try writing something. I’ve got a ton of riffs. I’ll send you a riff that I’m not totally married to. You do something to it and send it back. I’ll do something to it and send it back. And we’ll kind of do a chain mail.” And we ended up writing a song called Star Chasm that is a good start. It’s really interesting, but admittedly it sounds like two people who are tag-teaming in terms of writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: And that’s on Empath?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: No it was going to be, but I think it deserves to be something that we pursue together. So we’ve discussed writing together, however long that may take. Five years, ten years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Excellent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: It’s a good start. And then I sent him–This last song on Empath is called Singularity and it’s 22 minutes long and it’s not nearly as full of shit as that sounds. Actually I think I can say this and I don’t know how it came up, but he asked to hear it, so I sent it to him and he was really taken by it and asked to do a solo on it. It was originally going to be Vernon Reid, who I had met, who’s really a cool guy, but we just couldn’t seem to make that happen. It’s a complicated solo at the end that I was just too lazy or whatever and figuring out what could make it work. Steve offered to do it and he did and he put a brilliant solo at the end of it. I’ve known this guy for thirty years and every now and then I’m like, “Oh Steve Vai’s on my record.” It’s still really cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah. He has an effect. It’s him more than us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: I think the name, too. I just remember being so taken by him as a teen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Same here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: Yeah?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: It’s still that. But, yeah, he did a great solo on it. I really appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: When we talk on the phone, I get butterflies in the stomach, like when I call him or see his name on the phone, I’m like, “Hahhhhh.” [Laughs.] And it’s like, “Oh yeah, I’ve known this guy for twenty-some years.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: Yeah, I think it’s interesting how we’ve all grown together in a lot of ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: He’d be the first to admit that he’s grown in a lot of ways too. He remains one of the most generous people that I’ve worked with in this industry. He’s done more for me than anybody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: I might even say the same about him for myself. He changed my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: Yeah, me too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: So the album comes out when?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: March 27.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Thanks so much for taking the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: Thank you, man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: I really appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: You’re more than welcome, man. Thank you for the interview. It’s been a pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Let’s go get some lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: Yeah! Where we going to eat?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Devin Townsend</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-interviews&quot;&gt;Other Interviews&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ad&quot;&gt;Looking for the interview segment about Devin’s creativity book? &lt;a href=&quot;/interview/devin-townsend/creativity&quot;&gt;Here it is!&lt;/a&gt; Or the interview segment about his new signature acoustic guitar, Steve Vai, X-JAMM, and more? &lt;a href=&quot;/interview/devin-townsend/guitar-vai-x-jamm&quot;&gt;Here it is!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chaos-and-order&quot;&gt;Chaos and Order&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devin Townsend is a bit of a conundrum. After 30 albums and decades of producing music, he still says he doesn’t know what he’s doing. He’s written a book on creativity, which is the impetus for this interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This interview is broken into a few segments. The first one we’re releasing is about his new album, &lt;em&gt;Empath&lt;/em&gt;, which will be released on March 29, 2019. I had the distinct honor and privilege of driving around in Devin’s car for about an hour and listening to nearly the whole thing, discussing with him the highs and lows of the record, themes and stories, and more. It was an unforgettable experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interview-transcript&quot;&gt;Interview Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: You’ve said some pretty superlative things on Twitter about Empath, but then you’ve also taken it back. “Well it’s just an album, it’s just music, it’s just…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: Both sides of me having a conversation. Okay, well what do I feel about Empath? I feel that–what I feel about it I don’t want to say. I feel like it’s brilliant. I feel like it’s–I feel like it represents me taking my life apart, laying it out, analyzing it, and letting it go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Let me tell you what Mike Keneally said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Because I emailed him and he said, “Devin is a unique creator in my experience.” This is not to embarrass you, by the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: No that’s all right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: “The speed with which he works and the totality of his vision and the uniqueness of the results, he is a genius in my estimation. Empath is a truly amazing record and one of the most rewarding projects I’ve ever been involved in.” Morgan [Agren] told me it was an incredible project. The people in it see the genius and I think that’s worth repeating, even if you don’t want to say it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: I mean, when you tell me these things about these people, my first thought is of them as people and how much I like them. I think my favorite thing about both Mike and Morgan is that I forget that they play music. And that when we have hang time, it’s nice. I think my biggest problem with it is I don’t like being the focus of that because I feel that all I’m doing is trying to honor something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, when they say these things about the record or when people say these things about the record, my hope is that people ultimately know that it’s not me, it’s the process. And the process is perfect, but I’m not perfect and the record’s not perfect. But what we’re trying to achieve is something that is perfect and maybe that’s why art exists because it’ll never be perfect. There’s always things to write about, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And I work super fast, but I also feel that’s because when you’re listening for it, it’s an immense amount of information and unless you’re focused, you’re going to miss it. So it’s just about your process has to be super fast and super efficient and you have to exercise and you have to meditate and you have to do these things because otherwise I think you end up internalizing it that this is you, as opposed to the collective unconscious where you’re just dipping your ladle into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Again, I think the intention is you’re dipping your ladle into it because you think it’s beautiful and you think that ultimately it can help. And I really appreciate that Mike says that and I really appreciate that Morgan says these things, but I’m super uncomfortable with it. It’s not that I don’t have an ego, because clearly my ego is enormous, but it’s just–when I sent the record out to the label, they used all these superlatives about it and I just didn’t know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I was just like, “I don’t want to respond. I don’t want to hear it.” At first, I was just like, “Oh I hope they like it. I hope they like it.” But then when they really liked it, I was like, “Oh my God, I don’t want to think about it.” So, clearly just by this interview you can see that my hangups as a dude are what makes the whole thing such a Gong Show, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Well that’s why we’re here and I’m not so-and-so from X magazine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: Well that’s it! I appreciate that as well because what I was always afraid of was it was going to get popular and I was going to become a representative for this sort of thing that I don’t understand. I try and surround myself with people that understand and respect me and respect the process and, you know, want to watch Rick and Morty with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;In that way, I can do this. I can totally function. If there’s not a huge amount of importance placed on it. Sometimes I’ll have people listen to the stuff and they feel something about it is over the top and I’m just like, “Oh my God, I don’t want to be here for that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: What I think is interesting is we were talking beforehand about Morgan. You just needed to let him do his thing. Why don’t you tell that story?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: Well, because of the music I tend to be privy to, if I could put it that way, is a very specific vision, like super singular in a lot of ways, there’s room in there for someone’s color to make it unique. But, within that there’s fundamentals to the song. Maybe 60-75% of the song that has to be a certain way. It’s like, “That hit has to be there or else that won’t work. And this here has to go like this or else that won’t work.” But past that, what you do with the cymbals, what you do with the fills, all you. But those 60-75% of things are really complicated a lot of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So with Morgan, because I spent a lot of time with Morgan, we’ve done a lot of playing, we did the Casualties of Cool project, I get along with his family, and we have a good social thing, I asked him to do it because he’s Morgan. He’s an amazing drummer and a beautiful person, I wanted that energy. But he hasn’t had to learn music since probably Zappa or Fred [Thordendal] or any of these things that he had done, so he was turning himself inside out trying to learn this stuff. He’s sending me texts like, “Man, I’ve been working on this for hours and I’ve got four bars. It just doesn’t sink in.” Right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: He’s not a chart kind of guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: No! But when you let him be Morgan, there’s no one as good. So, I watched him and he’s like, “I really wanted to do this right,” and everything. He’s playing it and I’m thinking, “Man, what you’re doing doesn’t sound like Morgan to me. It sounds like you with a leash on.” So I was like, “Oh my God, the deadline for this record is coming up and there’s so much to learn and I can’t leave this to chance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So I said to him, “Let’s do a Skype call.” And I said, “Well what if I got two other drummers? One guy who does death metal who’s the best I can find for the CD. He’s a good dude. And one guy does progressive heavy metal. He’s willing to chart it and play it exactly with the cymbals any way we want.” And Morgan’s like, “Thank God. Sounds great.” And I said, “Okay, but I still want you on there, so let’s figure out how to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So I gave it some thought and every drummer had a different process that on the documentary I think it’s easier to hear that there. But with Morgan, at least, when he showed up, what I did was I took each song that I wanted him to do–So maybe he had four or five songs and then parts. Like the first song is Anup [Sastry] and then Sam [Paulicelli] and then Morgan and then Sam and then Anup and it’s all Frankenstein’d together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So what I did with all Morgan’s parts was I took the song and I took each riff that I wanted him to do and he was like, “Do you want me to learn it ahead of time?” And I was like, “Well actually, no. I don’t want you to learn anything. Nothing at all.” And he showed up kind of confused like, “Well what do you want me to play?” I had taken each song and taken each riff and then I looped each riff for 20 minutes in this massive long section and I just sat in front of him and, without telling him what the riff was, I had an iPad and I put on the iPad a picture of what I wanted to achieve. If you look up YouTube, there’s four-hour sunsets…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: That’s where you taped it to his kick drum, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: Yeah. I said, “This is what it’s supposed to feel like.” And I just asked Nali, I said, “Press record.” And then usually three or four minutes in, Morgan was playing phenomenal things. And I was like, “Okay, next riff.” And then I just chopped it up and then put it together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: That’s awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: And it was great because at the end of it, he’s playing things that not only no one else would think of, but he wouldn’t remember if we had to do that for a week of rehearsals. It helps I got his first take of it and his crazy little embellishments. We had a great time. It was super easy and I didn’t have to work, which is awesome because I like getting it right, but I don’t like working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: Even at the recording, Mike who loves working–I had written all these crazy little guitar things that I played once and then I forgot because I was like, “Oh that’s too hard. I don’t want to play that shit.” But Mike would say, “Well what is that part?” And I was like, “I don’t know.” He’s like, “Well let me figure it out!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And then Mike would figure it out and he’d learn these riffs and then I’d be like, “Well the idea is for the bass player to do that.” And he’d say, “Well okay, maybe you can come in here while the bass player’s learning.” And I was like, “That sounds terrible.” I was like, “Why don’t you–because you learned that bit–why don’t you show him how to play it?” And he was all about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So he ended up taking Nathan [Navarro] and showing him all these parts, and the whole time, Anup, Sam, both those guys learned those guys learned their parts. I had Anup come over to Vancouver and I showed him exactly. And Sam, I gave him all the MIDI so that he knew it exactly. So the whole recording, Anup and Sam were in there with the engineers and they were so intent on getting it right that I knew that the parts were good and I didn’t have to do that. And Mark and Mike were so conscientious about getting these super intricate parts, like, exactly that he went to go with an engineer and he’d sit and I watched TV for two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It was great! Because when I came in, everybody was so dedicated to getting it right and I had told them ahead of time, “This is what it is. Here’s a demo. The demos are super-specific. These are the notes. This is exactly how I want it to sound.” But I don’t want to do that. It’s really difficult. [Laughs.] You know what I mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: What brought Mike in? Had you worked with Mike before?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: He called me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: This was just a–off the cuff?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: He called me a couple years ago. He’s like, “I’m not doing anything. We’ve never met. We should try and do something together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: That’s what’s so great about Mike. I love that guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: Yeah! Yeah! Same. He came to Vancouver and we wrote a bunch of crazy shit that arguably doesn’t have a lot of place anywhere, which is separate from all of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Oh! It’s not on the record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: No, it’s like eight songs of just, like, explosive creative wank. You know what I mean? It’s like, a lot of fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: They sell pills for that. [Laughs.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: Oh God. When are we gonna endorse ‘em? You know what I mean? ECW.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Explosive Creative Wank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: It’s a good name for a band, actually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: You should make that happen. I could see that happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;DT: ECW? Okay.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Western Culture by Henry Cow</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;video&quot;&gt;Video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/tGDyCCQzCmw?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;worst-album-ever&quot;&gt;Worst album ever?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to jam screwdrivers into my ears the first time I listened to Henry Cow’s album Western Culture. I remember hearing the first 10 seconds, then my jaw dropping and my eyes bulging out of my face. It was the worst music I’d ever heard. But like a good road rage video on YouTube, I couldn’t turn it off. This was a different kind of “music” and I just didn’t understand it. My gut told me there was more going on than I could appreciate but my ears told me to turn it off immediately, as my wife continues to do every time she hears Henry Cow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only exposure to the band was through their song “Nirvana for Mice,” which is fairly accessible and melodic. I knew they were a weird band and that their mascot was a knitted sock on the cover of several of their records. What I didn’t know is that they were out of their minds, fiercely rebellious, and deep, deep into music theory. My good friend Jake, who has a music degree, explained a bit of what Henry Cow was doing and that knowledge was the key to unlocking my true appreciation for this album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western Culture contains two pieces of music with several movements. The first piece, History and Prospects, is a brutal beating of various atonal motifs ending with a hypnotic and nauseating dirge. The second piece, Day by Day, is more like Chinese water torture complemented by one of the most incredible piano solos I’ve ever heard. I’ve listened to this solo several times and I legitimately cannot figure out how a human played it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This album was a jaw-dropper for me in three ways: 1. Because it has the most courageous opening minute of any album I’ve ever heard. 2. Because learning how to listen to this album permanently changed the way I listen to music. 3. It helped me to realize that sometimes music isn’t “good” or “bad,” but something I understand or something I don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve never heard Henry Cow before, I recommend reading the very thorough Wikipedia page about their history and their approach to music. It’s enlightening, encouraging, and thought-provoking. They were a group of women and men with skin in the game. They did everything they could to avoid routine music performance. They changed how they approached their instruments. They kicked members out in the middle of touring just to shake things up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, this album is very listenable to me now. I actually really love it. A lot of it is singable if you can pick out the different motifs. If you’ve never heard it, take 40 minutes and listen with a very open mind. If you’ve heard it and hated it, ask a friend with a music degree to help you hear what you aren’t hearing. It’s not an easy album and it will enrich your life.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>O Holy Night in 5/4 by Anthony Garone</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;video&quot;&gt;Video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/OZOT7gVohwQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love weird music and I love &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; Christmas music, but most of it is just garbage. Uninteresting, “happy,” bland music that’s too much about commercial interests. In my mind, the story of Christmas has been wayyy over-glossed and has almost nothing to do with a baby being born 2,000 years ago in the middle east in a barn in the desert. So, I like to rearrange Christmas songs to reflect my view of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ad&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buy “O Holy Night” as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/o-holy-night-feat-jon-lang-sarah-garone-rob-m%C3%BCller/948367454?i=948367461&quot;&gt;digital download on iTunes &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fab fa-itunes&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife is singing on this one and is the “star” of the show, but the instrumentation turned out so much better than I hoped when I wrote and released this arrangement in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;credits&quot;&gt;Credits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sarah Garone: Lead vocals&lt;/li&gt;
