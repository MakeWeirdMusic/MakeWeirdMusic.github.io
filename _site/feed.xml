        <title>Aye-Aye Monster by Mike Keneally and Andy West</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;mike-keneally-house-concert&quot;&gt;Mike Keneally House Concert&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November 2016, Mike kindly played a house concert in my dining room, which was great fun. It took me several months to finally get around to editing some of the footage and this song was one of the highlights of the evening. Mike and Andy did several songs together and Mike did several other songs on his own. More of this concert will be released throughout 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, enjoy this first release from the concert titled “Aye-Aye Monster” from the 1995 release of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keneally.com/music/discography-mike-keneally/the-mistakes/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mistakes&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://store.keneally.com/products/ex-2303d&quot;&gt;buy a digital copy from keneally.com &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Weasel Shake by Robbie Seahag Mangano</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;weasel-shake&quot;&gt;Weasel Shake&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2017, I went to New York on a business trip and bumped into Robbie Seahag (more on that in a later video), whose name you may recall from our rooftop recording of &lt;a href=&quot;/learn/33-in-buffalo&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;33 in Buffalo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; off his sold-out album, &lt;em&gt;Full Moon Fever&lt;/em&gt;. As I accidentally stumbled upon his residence, he quickly taught me another song from &lt;em&gt;Full Moon Fever&lt;/em&gt; and we recorded this fun video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;video&quot;&gt;Video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/5z2d9EdBF_4?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ad&quot;&gt;You should check out Robbie’s new album, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bumbleweenie.com&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bumbleweenie&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and buy one of his donation packages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;video-stuff&quot;&gt;Video Stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robbie graciously offered to do some wonderful animation to make this video stand out from the rest. I’m proud to feature this song on the site and to have participated in this recording. Thank you, Robbie!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for some really fun, funny, and ridiculous content from my day with Robbie. Gonna make your cheeks hurt. I had a headache from laughing so hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bumbleweenie&quot;&gt;Bumbleweenie&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a commercial for Robbie’s amazing new album, &lt;em&gt;Bumbleweenie&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Another Groan by Nick Prol</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;video&quot;&gt;Video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/9PSlHJzPyzw?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nick-prol-amp-the-proletarians&quot;&gt;Nick Prol &amp;amp; The Proletarians&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick Prol is an artist and musician based in Tucson, Arizona. He’s a super cool dude and has amassed an incredible roster. He is working on a new album with his band, Nick Prol &amp;amp; The Proletarians. Here’s some information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fproletariansmusic%2Fvideos%2F1256978847712376%2F&amp;amp;show_text=0&amp;amp;width=560&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; style=&quot;border:none;overflow:hidden&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The album is being produced by the one and only &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ianbeabout&quot;&gt;Ian Beabout &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and features artists like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._Stevie_Moore&quot;&gt;R. Stevie Moore &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Crow&quot;&gt;Rob Crow &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinback&quot;&gt;Pinback &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymme_Jones&quot;&gt;Thymme Jones &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheer-Accident&quot;&gt;Cheer-Accident &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), and members of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleepytime_Gorilla_Museum&quot;&gt;Sleepytime Gorilla Museum &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knifeworld&quot;&gt;Knifeworld &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Chiefs_3&quot;&gt;Secret Chiefs 3 &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking_Plague&quot;&gt;Thinking Plague &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bent_Knee&quot;&gt;Bent Knee &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a veritable “who’s who” of weird music!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shamelessly begged Nick to let me participate in some way and he offered a guitar solo opportunity. He asked for something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Belew&quot;&gt;Adrian Belew &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/king-crimson&quot;&gt;King Crimson&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discipline_(King_Crimson_album)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discipline&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; era. I threw in a little &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Frith&quot;&gt;Fred Frith &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for good measure and captured the solo you see and hear above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I’d like to note: I’ve never let myself “go” like I did with this solo. It’s the first time you’ll ever see me &lt;em&gt;move&lt;/em&gt; while playing the guitar. My wife once called me “an impenetrable monolith,” which I’d say also describes my guitar playing. It was a lot of fun recording this and I was highly surprised to see the video afterward.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Failure to Fracture, Ep. 4</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;episode-4-overzealous-precision&quot;&gt;Episode 4: Overzealous Precision&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After learning about the technique Robert Fripp uses to play &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;FraKctured&lt;/em&gt;, I became somewhat obsessed with following the technique religiously. Then I realized that the technique is a starting point and not a mandate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/fracture/id978457922?i=978458012&quot;&gt;Purchase King Crimson’s &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt; on iTunes &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://store.nexternal.com/dgm/starless-and-bible-black-c228.aspx&quot;&gt;Or, purchase the album on Robert Fripp’s website &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;video&quot;&gt;Video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the video to accompany this episode of &lt;em&gt;Failure to Fracture&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/1enMm81dexg?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-failure-to-fracture&quot;&gt;What is &lt;em&gt;Failure to Fracture&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/learn/fracture&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Failure to Fracture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a video series I’ve put together about all the things that have stood in the way of my successfully playing the song &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/king-crimson&quot;&gt;King Crimson&lt;/a&gt; despite years and years of study, practice, writing, and making videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;episode-list&quot;&gt;Episode List&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/learn/fracture&quot;&gt;Episode 0: Introduction&lt;/a&gt; (includes notation/tablature)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/learn/fracture/stress&quot;&gt;Episode 1: Stress and Tension&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/learn/fracture/picks&quot;&gt;Episode 2: Picking Picks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/learn/fracture/inefficient-picking&quot;&gt;Episode 3: Inefficient Picking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/learn/fracture/overzealous-precision&quot;&gt;Episode 4: Overzealous Precision&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;too-precise&quot;&gt;Too Precise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After hours and hours of practicing the technique learned at my Guitar Circle introductory course in February 2015, I became a bit too zealous in following the “rules” of right-hand picking and “release and return.” Particularly during the “death picking” section of &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt;’s moto perpetuo section. That’s the part with all the string skipping. Well, the part where the string-skipping spans multiple strings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have tried playing the piece, you’ll know what I’m talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, to pick a note, you should move the pick to it via the elbow and move the pick through the string via the wrist. So, to play a note on the 5th string, then the 3rd string, then the 2nd string, then the 3rd string, and over and over again, it requires 4 movements of the elbow to bring the pick to each string before striking the pick through the string. All this during a barrage of 16th notes at 130 beats per minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not gonna happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I changed my approach to think of the space between the strings and where the pick could be moved through the string via pickstrokes from the wrist. Again, these motions have their origins &lt;em&gt;between&lt;/em&gt; strings. So, to play…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;|-----------------------------------------|
|-----6---6-------6---6-------6-------6---|
|---6---6---6---6---6---6---6---6---6---6-|
|-------------3-----------5-------6-------|
|-4---------------------------------------|
|-----------------------------------------|
  X Y         X Y         X Y     X Y

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By following the presumed “rules” (i.e. rules I’d made up using my own assumptions, not specifically taught in the introductory course), I would move my elbow to bring the pick to every string, which really wasn’t realistic. By forgetting the rules and sticking the the spirit of the technique, as I understood it after dozens of hours of practice, I would only move my elbow for the notes marked with X or Y in the tablature above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the duration of Y, I would keep my hand positioned so that the pick would remain between the 2nd and 3rd strings in an idle origin state. This gave me an opportunity to focus on just a few motions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Moving from position X to Y&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Moving my wrist to hit the notes while in position Y&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Moving from position Y to position X&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the notes for position X are always downstrokes, a simple repetitive pattern is easily established. The hardest part is moving to the right strings in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch the video in case this isn’t clear from the writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here are some gifs of the master playing &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/0FP5kyPiyKE?t=10m29s&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moving Force&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is basically a piece built around the death picking section from the moto, but in Fripp’s New Standard Tuning.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Patrick Grant</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Patrick Grant is a composer based in New York City. He founded the musical group, &lt;a href=&quot;http://tiltedaxes.com&quot;&gt;Tilted Axes &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and has worked with with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cage&quot;&gt;John Cage &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Robert Fripp and the Orchestra of Crafty Guitarists, Billy Joel, and Quincy Jones. I met Patrick in Mexico while I attended the Guitar Circle introductory course. He was attending the Ochestra of Crafty Guitarists preparation course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love this interview and Patrick offers so much wisdom and insight. Lots of great stuff in here, so make sure you read/listen/watch the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/steve-ball&quot;&gt;Steve Ball&lt;/a&gt; for pushing me in Patrick’s direction!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.patrickgrant.com&quot;&gt;Check out Patrick’s website! &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interview-transcript&quot;&gt;Interview Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Hi, this is Anthony with MakeWeirdMusic.com and we have a special guest with us from New York City. His name’s Patrick Grant and he’s a composer. Thank you for joining us, Patrick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PG: Thank you for having me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah, no problem. It’s my privilege to have you on here and I really appreciate you taking the time this early morning to chat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PG: We’ll see how you feel about that a little later…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: [Laughs] So, I know you’ve been working in music for 30 years now and you’ve got a lot going on now. A lot of momentum in your career. Can you talk about some of the projects you’ve got going on right now and some of the highlights that you care to share with us?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PG: Sure! I was born in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit&quot;&gt;Detroit &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I was making music there. No child prodigy by any means. I was always interested in visual art, but I made this shift to music when I was around 11 years old because it just seemed to be another way of creating universes within which to dwell, which is probably a good way for a first-born child to go when you have no other playmates. You just create these universes. But anyway, I’ll be jumping ahead many years here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I moved to New York in 1985 to continue schooling at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juilliard_School&quot;&gt;Juilliard School &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to finish there as well as to play in bands because I was also interested in rock and pop music, which is a real Detroit thing to have a foot in both worlds. I continued to have a foot in both worlds ever since. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;If I had three feet, I’d be sticking that in a third world, too.&lt;/span&gt; It seems that every five years or so, I take my work into a different direction, but it’s all part of the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;One of the things that really got me going here in New York City was the opportunity to work with theater companies. They always need composers. Avant garde theater companies were creating original work as well as having an opportunity to put on concerts and perform in art galleries because that always attracted me as an idea. I still produce a lot of shows myself, so I’ve always had that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Gang&quot;&gt;Little Rascals &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “Hey guys, let’s put on a show” kind of feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I like the fact that a lot of the composers I admired–&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cage&quot;&gt;John Cage &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Glass&quot;&gt;Philip Glass &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;–at the time in the 1980s, they drew a lot of inspiration and resource from the art world here in New York City. So, that was a way for me to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Along the way, I found myself creating music for theater and dance, working with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamelan&quot;&gt;gamelan &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, writing a lot of electronic music. For a while, I was known mostly as being a keyboardist, but when I decided to try out with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Fripp&quot;&gt;Robert Fripp &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Craft&quot;&gt;Guitar Circle &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and get back into my guitar playing, I created this project, Tilted Axes: Music for Mobile Electric Guitars that has most people now thinking of me as a guitarist or working with electric guitars more than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/sQ78iTKSFkA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Generally, I feel that when people feel a little too comfortable in terms of what I am, it’s time to shake things up. Maybe that’s what lies ahead for me in 2017. Time to shake things up again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: That’s great. That’s how you and I met–we were at the Guitar Circle course in Mexico. You were in the Orchestra of Crafty Guitarists Preparation course and I was in the Introduction course. That’s how I found out about you, just playing guitar. Obviously, you’ve done much more than guitar. I absolutely love on the Tilted Axes CD how much you blend a lot of the Guitar Circle-oriented material, or just some of the kind of thematic concepts from that style of music, into a kind of a rock-oriented context or groove-oriented. I really appreciate that about your album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PG: Yeah, well, I would say that one of the things that drew me to the Guitar Circle was I was working with large–I had just started re-examining large ensembles a year or two prior to joining the Guitar Circle or even really knowing about the Guitar Circle and created the Tilted Axes project. What drew me so much to the group was its similarity to my work with the Indonesian gamelan and creating music in circles and how working within a circle inspires music that’s created by geometric and visual patterns, which I’d done a lot of before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/_0-_3pcwC-Q?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Yeah, I definitely have absorbed some of the techniques from the Circle, but I also say at the same time, I’ve also admired how the Circle has absorbed other techniques from the gamelan itself, which doesn’t seem surprising because when I look at a lot of their work–or, I’m happy to say “our work” in the Circle over those number of years–&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;there’s just a lot of parallels there in terms of how music can be made in circulations, in terms of breaking up music made in a circle into different patterns of 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, 6s, even 9s and have it all work out equally well in terms of 360-degree music.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, I definitely have incorporated or synthesized a lot of stuff. That’s probably something I got from working with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Living_Theatre&quot;&gt;The Living Theatre &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The Living Theatre is–if one doesn’t know, they should definitely look it up because one of the things that attracted me to working with them is they have a long history, but they’re also the venue upon which composers like John Cage and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Harrison&quot;&gt;Lou Harrison &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were able to peruse their first concerts in the 1950s and 1960s and they would always give a lot of trust to their composers to really create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Being a composer for them also meant that I had a space to work within. So, there was a parallel there in terms of working with and synthesizing a lot of different elements. In fact, Living Theatre is probably most known for and have been credited with being synthesists in that whatever’s going on in their environment, not just as individuals, but in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeitgeist&quot;&gt;zeitgeist &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, finding a way of pulling everything together under a larger umbrella and showing the bigger picture. The Tilted Axes picture was definitely a part of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;There’s a lot of different kinds of music I was working with that appeared on that album as well as a lot of guitar stuff that, as you said, yeah I did. In terms of becoming “groovified” in terms of the greater good come together in what I hope is a cohesive album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: I think it’s a fantastic record. &lt;em&gt;The Kneadle Variations&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Coda&lt;/em&gt;… I laughed for minutes, not because there was anything comical but just because I love what you did. It brought such joy to my heart hearing those pieces reinterpreted in that style. It was great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PG: Yeah, those were two themes. One’s a very famous Guitar Craft theme, &lt;em&gt;Eye of the Needle&lt;/em&gt;, by Robert Fripp. This other one was just a riff, a way of breaking up rhythm that had a lot of resonance with what &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Béla_Bartók&quot;&gt;Bartok &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; does in terms of what he gets from folk music that I just put a blues scale into. Then with &lt;em&gt;Eye of the Needle&lt;/em&gt;, I was playing that–at least its core riff being the same fingering, but played in standard tuning as opposed to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_standard_tuning&quot;&gt;New Standard Tuning &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;–which, in one position, it’s all whole tones. In another position it’s all pentatonic. And then writing melodies that pulled it all together. Robert was very generous in saying, “Go for it,” because I think he knew it wasn’t a goof but it was really a sincere experiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Right! It’s great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PG: Thanks! I was definitely very happy to have his support of that with a bit of a wink and a nudge, but I think he’s glad how it turned out as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: That’s cool. Can you tell us about some of your other musical releases that might be available for purchase or listening online or outside of a theater?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PG: Sure. I have been self-releasing and they’re available–four other albums. One shows a period of time about, jeez, in the late 1990s when I was doing a lot of work combining my love of gamelan with chamber ensembles, so I was playing a lot of keyboards that might have been tuned according to the gamelan. Or, I’d be using pure just intonation tunings mixed in with violas and guitars and–I think there’s one piece on there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/m7Vua_1xhSU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;A lot of music for film. I did music for a horror film that, for a while, was the essence of what was called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7Vua_1xhSU&quot;&gt;Patrick Grant Group &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It was 13 musicians and that in itself was a mini-orchestra using three keyboardists as its foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;That I got from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._D._Q._Bach&quot;&gt;PDQ Bach &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when I was a kid. He wrote this opera, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.schickele.com/composition/monksaria.htm&quot;&gt;Hansel and Gretel and Ted and Alice: An Opera in One Unnatural Act &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I was impressed because they had a piano, they had a harpsichord, and they had a calliope and the sound of those three keyboards was a perfect mini-orchestra. So, I’ve always used three keyboards in my ensemble augmented with violin, cello, trombone, electric guitar, flute, clarinet, and two percussion. So, a lot of work in that time period. &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/7351293&quot;&gt;You’ll find that work out there &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Then the work for gamelan proper, some of the scores that I’ve written for theatrical visionary, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Wilson_(director)&quot;&gt;Robert Wilson &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, most famous for his creation &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_on_the_Beach&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Einstein on the Beach&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with Philip Glass. For me, that was a huge influence in terms of what could be done on the stage and in terms of how music could be used and the creation of non-narrative narrative, which was fantastic. Bob Wilson said to me, “Patrick, everybody always asks me: &lt;em&gt;*What is Einstein on the Beach&lt;/em&gt; about?” I’d just tell him, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variation_(music)&quot;&gt;Themes and variations &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Themes and variations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/dKEXZ0YCNkI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;As a musician, that’s all I needed to hear.&lt;/span&gt; I thought, “That’s the story.” And that’s how we can create a lot of narratives. Themes and variations. So, I decided to try something different this year and I put together the Tilted Axes: Music for Mobile Electric Guitars album and it did better than I expected. I was happy that the public and the press really responded to it. There’s all kinds of music blogs out there I never knew existed who wrote some nice things about it, but also larger organizations like the Boston Globe, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wsj.com/articles/tilted-axes-music-for-mobile-electric-guitars-by-patrick-grant-and-rushing-past-willow-by-nick-zoulek-reviews-1476827463&quot;&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://teamrock.com/review/2016-10-29/review-roundup-this-months-best-new-progressive-music-releases&quot;&gt;Prog &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the UK, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-kompanek/on-the-culture-front-musi_b_13807228.html?&quot;&gt;the Huffington Post &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;… They really were able to see what I was doing, I felt, in terms of “it’s not a rock album, it’s not a classical album.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;If you look beyond the veneer of, “Hey, electric guitars,” there’s actually composition elements happening there that I’m happy people were listening to. So, now the trick is, how do I follow that up? The good news is: there is a plan and that plan is that I have a number of tracks that I’m finishing now and a number of tracks that have just been sitting around for the last year waiting for a reason that showcase the other kinds of music that I do that I’m working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I would say, compositionally, whether you like it or not, it sounds like me or it sounds like what I was influenced by or working with that week. I’d say it’s mostly, for a lack of a better word, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_music&quot;&gt;chamber music &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.” A lot of music for ensembles. There will be some electric guitar, percussion, and bass, but also violins, and cellos, and wind instruments, and some singing. One of the “hits” is this one piece that uses this very, very old public domain recording of one of those &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithsonian_Folkways&quot;&gt;Smithsonian Folkways recordings &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that were made down in Louisiana that I added elements to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/j1PxYB0wqSE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, I figured that, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;while I have people’s ears, let’s put out some other stuff to balance that&lt;/span&gt; out because on its heels, the album after that is the next Tilted Axes music, which is gonna be a little bit more thorny and convoluted than the first album. The first album dealt with themes and variations of different kinds of genres that one would associate with electric guitar. The punk ones, the blues ones, bass ones, even some that border on jazz to some level or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I would say that I’m trying to showcase what I can do in a contemporary classical way with the next album, and the Tilted album that we’re already working on, is going to be a sort of mix of the two in that the composition forms might be a little bit–I wouldn’t say “longer,” but I’d say “broader” or “more convoluted” because one of the reasons why the Tilted Axes album was so long was there was a big body of material, but I wanted to put it out on one album, so it’s 75 minutes long, but it’s almost a one-act theater piece in itself from beginning to end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Still, the pieces are more or less, with a few exceptions, sort of based in 4/4 and the reason of that is because, since this began as procession music, when Tilted Axes began 5 years ago for an event called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.makemusicny.org/winter/&quot;&gt;Make Music Winter &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as a public parade–I like to call them “processions” because, as it’s written in the album note, “What is the difference between a parade and a procession? Intention.” &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;It’s amazing how just putting it that way into the minds of the players, everyone all of a sudden shapes up a little bit, stands up a little bit straighter, and projects a different kind of vibe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;A lot of that music had to be in 4/4 because that is the tradition of being a biped and playing music that is mobile, going back to all kinds of marching bands, processions, going back a lot further than that… I have found out that, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;while it’s possible to play in 7/4 or 13/4 when we’re moving around, it is more challenging.&lt;/span&gt; This album’s not going to be concentrating on that as much as I want to create music that might not be as mobile, but can be used in a fashion–I like to say I’m concentrating on music for planetariums because for me, that’s sort of the dream gig because most museums have planetariums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;We have had a number of Tilted Axes events where we were mobile inside of a museum. There’s plenty of room to move, you can be inspired by the art, and for me, as a producer, I don’t have to worry about the weather. That was always a huge concern because, when you go through all this effort and it’s a one-day or two-day event and if you have the weather go bad on you–but I never have to worry about this inside of big museums. And most big museums do have planetariums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zAmv0-eeoYI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I have written a number of theater works and chamber works that are based upon elements from science&lt;/span&gt;, whether it’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.patrickgrant.com/genome.htm&quot;&gt;the human genome &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/patrickgrant22&quot;&gt;CD Baby &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)–I actually had a piece called &lt;a href=&quot;http://patrickgrant.com/BigBang.htm&quot;&gt;Big Bang &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; before &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory&quot;&gt;the hugely popular CBS sitcom &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; came on the air and pretty much killed that title for anybody else. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;That was actually created, like a lot of this work, in collaboration with scientists. That’s very important for me, too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Whether it seems that these pieces are whimsical, because I’m doing my poetic interpretation of these scientific things, still as it’s presented, the science has to be correct and accurate. That’s very important to me. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;You can bust me on a whole number of things: “Why did you use that chord?” “Why did you decide to use that rhythm?” But you can’t bust me on the science.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And I’ve found a lot of inspiration in my gamelan works and other pieces in structural models found in science. That was another phase I went through. I was finding structures and forms in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory&quot;&gt;chaos theory &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Music that is self-similar and self-described, where it may be finding one measure of the music, in a way, becomes the DNA for a larger piece. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;It’s just a matter of scaling it to different discrete levels, moving at different speeds. But that kind of stuff really interests me and is the stuff that gets me motivated.&lt;/span&gt; But, first and foremost, if you’re just a casual listener or a deep listener, it’d be nice that there’s a level or layer there that you could find worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: You’ve mentioned gamelan music quite a bit and, for people that are unfamiliar, I thought it might be helpful for you to define what that is. Part of our mission is to educate people and to expand their horizons with music, but also you’ve mentioned in other interviews that music is such a social event and in this day and age where you’ve got people like me who sit in a bedroom recording interviews and guitar things on my own…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PG: Am I in your bedroom?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Not MY bedroom, but a bedroom in my house. [Laughs] It’s just interesting to me that I grew up just playing an instrument not thinking of it as such a social thing, but music to you is clearly very social and almost all of your work is for a group, mostly large groups it sounds like. At least, large compared to normal band sizes of 3-5 pieces. So could you talk about gamelan and your concept of music as a social event?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/-6YWAZwI9Sk?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PG: First of all, I’ve been talking about gamelan. “Gamelan” is the Indonesian word for “orchestra.” If you’re saying “gamelan,” you might as well be saying “the Indonesian ensemble.” Their indigenous ensemble, whether it’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java&quot;&gt;Java &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bali&quot;&gt;Bali &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is made up of a series of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallophone&quot;&gt;metallophones &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or as I tell people, “Like xylophones, except all the keys are made of bronze.” It has a really nice metallic ring and shimmer to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;These are all arranged from tiny little ones that play in very high octaves of 5-note scales. There are some with 7, but that’s getting a little too “inside baseball.” Pretty much one octave per instrument. So as you go down in octaves, the instruments get progressively bigger and bigger until you get to the very lowest octaves and you have, maybe, huge slabs of bronze that are playing these low notes and then the foundation that holds it all together are huge, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gong#Nipple_gong&quot;&gt;button-faced gongs &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that–not to be confused with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gong#Chau_gong_.28Tam-tam.29&quot;&gt;Chinese tam tam &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that you see at the beginning of old movies. These are gongs that are tuned to specific pitches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;A lot of the music centers around some kind of a tonal center. So they have all these instruments. Sometimes 30-40 players playing these and they’re held together by two drummers playing something that I guess would look like congas held across the lap on the side. What makes this ensemble sound musically interesting to me is that all the instruments are played in pairs. The reason for that is that if they have two little ones, then two next size, two of those… the players playing in pairs are able to produce very blindingly fast passages by–I guess the western word is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hocket&quot;&gt;hocketing &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where they each divide up a melody, so if they want to play something that’s 16th notes, one player might be [playing one pattern and the other filling in the gaps].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/rp2yRpC2AR4?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;When you put the two together, it becomes a great thing to listen to having two ears because you hear this melody broken up. To complicate matters even more is that these two guys also have another two guys playing their same parts. They are tuned a couple of cents, depending on the village. Some villages like a large number of cents apart. Some a smaller number of cents. But &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;when you have those two bars that hit at the same time, the same pitch, and they’re off a number of cents, there will be a vibrato that happens between the two.&lt;/span&gt; So instead of just having a dull ringing tone, they’ll actually produce a shimmer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;A lot of gamelan aficianados feel that–well, some villages feel like, “Oh, we’re more rock and roll than you because we like a wider vibrato, so we tune ours 15 cents apart.” Other people say, “Oh no, that’s too brutal.” There’s all kinds of different styles, like any other kind of music. There’s many different uses for it, but one of the things that I found attractive and lent my ear to listen to it was it was one of the–along with West African drumming, which similarly concentrates on patterns that fit together in a hocketing kind of fashion–that attracted composer &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Reich&quot;&gt;Steve Reich &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;He was attracted to Indonesian gamelan, too, because a lot of the rhythms can only be described as very bebop sounding when you go to the island of Bali, which is interesting in that they’ve had this long tradition of creating the music in Java. But then in the 1920s when the Dutch–and a lot of Dutch artists have taken advantage of it being a colony and hanging out there for inspiration–but a lot of the Balinese gamelan music was really a 20th century creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;They actually, in the way that people used to chop old cars and turn them into hot rods, they pretty much melted down the Javanese gamelan and rebuilt it for speed. At the same time that some people were having a problem in the western world that classical musical instruments were being bastardized by being used to play jazz in the 1920s, and those rhythms were “barbaric” and “not for lofty purposes…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;The exact same thing was happening in Indonesian in terms of the beautiful court instruments of the Javanese gamelan were being melted down and were now being played by those “barbaric” Balinese as a kind of “moron music.” That’s what jazz was being derided as in the 1920s. But to pull that whole thing together and to put an umbrella over it all is that this music doesn’t exist in an abstract fashion in these societies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/HfrOSJRCsfM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Whether it’s the courts of Java or the more ceremonial use in Bali, they’re always for a specific purpose and they’re still not, like a lot of West African music, they’re still not divided from the dance. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;There’s not “the dance,” there’s not “the music.” They’re one and the same thing.&lt;/span&gt; That division has not been made yet. If it was the afternoon ceremony doing an offering for the gods, there’s a specific song and dance for that. If there’s a special ceremony for the full moon–which full moon? Well, we’ve got a ceremony and a dance for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And there’s more social ceremonies that would always have their village gamelan and their dancers dance for weddings and feasts and all these other things that every society has used to mark their calendar. So, that’s the one thing that interests me very music was that the music had a purpose in every society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;When I first went to Bali–I’ve been there three times to study the work–was that as you pass through the different villages, you can hear each village having its own gamelan perform its evening music or taking part in some kind of ceremony. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;It’s for real and that’s why I liked it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And they have their own tuning system, which I found very interesting, too. They’re using 5-note scales, but they’re not at all tuned like the 5 black keys on our piano. They may be technically pentatonic scales, because they use five notes, but they break up the octave very differently. So when you do hear it, all of a sudden, there’s no such thing as “harmony.” A lot of it is “horizontal” movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Anyways, this obviously was hugely impactful upon what I wanted to do. When I studied those rhythms and studied how those things were put together, I did join &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamelan_Son_of_Lion&quot;&gt;Gamelan Son of Lion &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a new music gamelan that’s been around since the 1970s here in New York City and it gave a chance for young composers to write for these ensembles and experiment, but I was also interested in using those kinds of rhythms and non-standard tunings with my electronic keyboard ensemble because I felt like I owned that more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I didn’t want to be grabbing someone’s music, but I was happy to learn about how the rhythms could interact and apply that to a lot of the other music I’d been using. A lot of that still carries forth when needed in everything I do today. A lot of that can be heard on this last Tilted Axes album. Here and there, it’s there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZXJWO2FQ16c?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: As Steve Reich’s Music for 18 Musicians is one of my favorite albums of all time, you’ve also mentioned it in a couple of places…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PG: Yeah, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;a friend gave that to me when I was 14 and that’s maybe too young.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: But, I would imagine these kinds of ensembles that have had such an impact on you have greatly informed your composition style. In going to Juilliard, did you study orchestration or something or write pieces for larger ensembles or is that just something that you felt personally inclined to do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PG: I always say, “I went to Juilliard,” but I never claimed to have finished Juilliard. So anyone who says I’m a Juilliard graduate is putting out a fiction that I never put out. But, I did go to Juilliard for two years but I never finished because I had to work here and I did that by working for a classical music publisher, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edition_Peters&quot;&gt;C F Peters &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who also published John Cage’s work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So that’s how I was able to meet with the people who were working with John Cage and work within that circle, but I was taking private composition lessons when I was 15 because that’s all I was doing. I was just trying to–even if I didn’t know what I was doing, I still had a facility for writing music and I thought I was drawing pictures sometimes. The patterns were there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/vFYdNMXJOsE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But, how orchestration really came about for me–not having an orchestra–was having electronic keyboards and synthesizers. It seems that the way our ears work and the way physics works that you can find any possible sound-making device and you can pigeonhole it into, “Well, is it string-like? Is it percussion? Is it brass? Or is it a woodwind sound?” That pretty much covers the spectrum of how sound is made. But, working a lot with orchestral scores and working a lot with composer composers contributed a lot to just understanding orchestration and how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;One of the things that was useful was moving to New York City and just knowing a lot of people really doing it.&lt;/span&gt; It’s like, “Read this book because everybody here read it and that’s how we’re doing it.” That becomes a whole little culture in itself, but a lot of that… I did grow up playing violin and viola and playing in an orchestra, so I had a pretty good idea for how these instruments work and I was writing for these instruments since I was a kid, so–it didn’t happen overnight, but that was definitely part of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But getting back to what you’re saying, I’ve always liked the idea of music for ceremony. Working with The Living Theatre who was influenced by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre_of_Cruelty&quot;&gt;Artaud Theater &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as ritual, John Cage himself would say that every performance is a form of theater. I take it as seriously as that. So, I’ve been able to apply that and of course my love of Indonesian music. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;It’s not just a gig for me. It is a kind of a ceremony.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/nBFnK82yyOI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Even the smallest performance should be taken that way. I think that whether it’s expressed to the public or not that this is the reason behind the performance, it comes through. Even &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Byrne&quot;&gt;David Byrne &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Heads&quot;&gt;Talking Heads &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; wrote a book called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Music_Works&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;How Music Works&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and it’s got some good sections. The one section that I think he writes near the beginning reinforces what I’m saying is that he’s coming out of playing &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBGB&quot;&gt;CBGB &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;’s in the late 1970s, but &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;any music that ever seems to work has to come out of some kind of a scene. If there’s no scene, the music doesn’t go very far.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So maybe his work has come out of a scene, but I think that’s a form of a ceremony. You look at something like CBGB’s in the 1970s, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;it was like a church in a way. It was a ritual. People knew how to dress for it. People knew how to act for it. There was a whole code that went along with those serious performances.&lt;/span&gt; That had its code as well as performances in Indonesia as well as at a rave in Amsterdam has its code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, yeah, whether you want to call it ceremonies or scenes, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;it’s important and that’s one of the things I like about producing the shows is: you are creating a scene.&lt;/span&gt; If you’re going to do that, it’s good to know what all your forbears did before you. Not just in terms of their successes, but a lot of times in terms of their failures, too, because you don’t want to fail when you don’t have to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;But if you don’t try, you’ll never know. You can’t be afraid to fail&lt;/span&gt; because I can’t say that everything I’ve done has worked, but you can dust yourself off and learn something from that and move on. I’m happy to say it seems like there’s been enough things that we’ve done that when we synthesize and pull things together, it’s been having a decent impact on a large number of people. So, despite 2016 being such a year of extremes, there has been good parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Absolutely. And to wrap things up, can you tell us where to find your music and where to find more information about you and your projects?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/njifOZB74A8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PG: Yeah. I’ll take this as an opportunity to tell you that as a result of my interest in chaos theory and such, the name of my production company has been Strange Music. So, you’ve got the “weird music,” I’ve got the “strange music.” I used to put on concerts and say, “Strange Music Presents.” When I was with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_Music,_Inc.&quot;&gt;BMI &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Strange Music was the name of my publishing company. Now it’s Peppergreen Media with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Society_of_Composers,_Authors_and_Publishers&quot;&gt;ASCAP &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But still, my larger company, the one I file with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Sam&quot;&gt;Uncle Sam &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; every year, that’s Strange Music, Inc. The reason why is because I was finding–a number of reasons! First of all, the word “strange” contains my last name, “Grant.” Also, I was thinking of the strange attractors that were found in chaos theory in terms of patterns that are created out of seemingly random events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Also influenced very much by a Samuel Butler quote that John Cage was particularly influenced by, and that is, “The only things that we truly hate are the unfamiliar things.” Especially when you apply that towards music, a lot of people–they want to be pacified. They don’t want to be challenged, you know? I remember that even albums like Steve Reich’s 18 Musicians…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I mean, I was 14 years old and I can’t say that I &lt;em&gt;liked&lt;/em&gt; it the first time I heard it, but &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;like most things I really end up liking, I get challenged, I don’t like it at first, but you keep on coming back like, “Oh, let me listen to it again to be sure that it really sucks.” As it turns out, it grows on you because it ends up changing your mind. It’s that laziness that a lot of people are battling with when they’re challenged.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/kIAtNak16KU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, anyways, that’s the name of my company. All websites lead to Rome. Or, at least, all websites lead to the same place, so if you go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://strangemusic.com&quot;&gt;strangemusic.com &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, that’s the same as &lt;a href=&quot;http://patrickgrant.com&quot;&gt;patrickgrant.com &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is the same as &lt;a href=&quot;http://tiltedaxes.com&quot;&gt;tiltedaxes.com &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. So, that’s one way of centralizing things because I find that after a 30-year career, people stumble upon my work or are looking to get from my work different things. So, there’s different ways of putting it out there. So, that’s pretty much information central for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;If you go there, you’ll see that we have our own podcast called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stringsandthingsshow.com&quot;&gt;Strings and Things podcast &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and that we have Facebook fan pages and all the usual stuff you’d expect to find. But, it needs a revamping, but all the information is current. And I have to say, speaking of such, you really do a fantastic job at Make Weird Music. Your stuff looks great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Oh, thanks a lot! I appreciate that. It’s really nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PG: I notice those things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Thank you, Patrick. There is so much more I want to talk to you about, so if you wouldn’t mind, I’d like to have a follow-up conversation with you in a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PG: Sure!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Plenty to think about from this and plenty of places to diverge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PG: Oh, absolutely. But, thanks for letting me spout off. I hope I was helpful. One thing I did have to say, being thorough, but not too thorough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Oh, it’s perfect. Thank you so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;PG: Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Steve Vai&#39;s EVO &amp; Mad Hatter Terminator Kit</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;video&quot;&gt;Video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETPKHwA7AY&quot;&gt;Here’s a video &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about the installation of the Mad Hatter SVST-HSH Terminator Kit in EVO:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thanks&quot;&gt;Thanks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Russell Muller for joining me on some of this escapade and engineering the A/V stuff for the installation video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;preface&quot;&gt;Preface&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kinda promised myself I wouldn’t make this a sentimental/nostalgic post, but the content means so much to me that I’d feel inauthentic doing otherwise. &lt;a href=&quot;/interview/steve-vai&quot;&gt;Steve Vai&lt;/a&gt;’s guitar, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evo_(guitar)&quot;&gt;EVO &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, can be heard on on some of my favorite music of all time. I was &lt;em&gt;obsessed&lt;/em&gt; with the guitar as a teenager when I found out about the guitar in 1995. Seriously, I carried &lt;a href=&quot;http://ibanezrules.com/catalogs/us/1995/index.htm&quot;&gt;the 1995 Ibanez Guitars catalog &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; everywhere I went in junior high and drew pictures of EVO in all my art classes (and other classes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EVO was all I would talk about with my friends and family at that time. In 1997, my grandmother, parents, and I pooled our money together and bought my Ibanez Jem7vwh, new in box. I’ve had that guitar ever since. That was 20 years ago now!! Sheesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, you may remember &lt;a href=&quot;/gear/mad-hatter&quot;&gt;my interview with “Electric Ed” Heisler&lt;/a&gt;, owner of &lt;a href=&quot;http://madhatterguitarproducts.com&quot;&gt;Mad Hatter Guitar Products &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I told Steve about Ed’s patent-pending potentiometer designs and what a difference it made in my Jem. Steve immediately said, “Would you install it in EVO?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, um… We did!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a little nerve-wracking leaving the venue with one of the most valuable guitars on the planet. I joked with Ed that I would rather Steve handed us a bag with 1 million dollars cash because cash is replaceable. I think Ed double-checked his homeowner’s insurance after he brought EVO home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;installation&quot;&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[You really should just watch the video to see what we did.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Ed installed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://madhatterguitarproducts.com/collections/terminator-single-volume-kits/products/copy-of-single-volume-single-tone-complete-kit-with-a-5-way-selector-switch-for-humbucker-single-humbucker-svst-hsh&quot;&gt;Mad Hatter Terminator SVST-HSH System &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, he took note of the existing wiring configuration. Steve was using a push-pull volume pot configuration with a 331K (.0033 microfarad) ceramic capacitor modification that rolled off some of the low end frequencies when engaged. Also, his tone pot had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guitarelectronics.com/product/TCO033/Orange-Drop-022-Microfarad-Tone-Capacitors-for-Guitar-Bass.html&quot;&gt;Vishay orange drop .022 microfarad tone capacitor &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ed customized a &lt;a href=&quot;https://madhatterguitarproducts.com/pages/yin-yang-push-pull-pot-mods&quot;&gt;Mad Hatter Yin Yang 500K push pull volume pot &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by placing the ceramic capacitor in parallel with the pot. He installed the Vishay capacitor on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://madhatterguitarproducts.com/products/mad-hatter-universal-cts-dual-value-potentiometer-with-stss-tone-lead&quot;&gt;Mad Hatter Killer Tone dual-value pot &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and wired it to 500K. He replaced Steve’s output jack with a new Mad Hatter Switchcraft output jack and replaced the existing 5-way CRL selector switch with the Mad Hatter Terminator 5-way CRL selector switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Terminator system design is solderless, so Ed connected everything to the appropriate terminals using the Mad Hatter Little Ass Screwdriver and gently tugged on all the wires once installed in the terminals to ensure secure attachment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before restringing the guitar, he used the Little Ass Screwdriver to ensure the pickups and switch configuration were working as expected. Once it passed inspection, we restrung the guitar and demo’d the new hardware. It sounded great to our ears, but only one set of ears truly mattered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ed and I brought the guitar to Steve’s studio about a week later and he loved the upgrade. He said, “It’s like EVO has a bigger set of lungs,” and specifically commented on an increase of clarity in the mid-range frequencies. Thomas Nordegg, Steve’s guitar tech, was also very happy with the tone. Ed and I were both smiling for hours afterward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, this was a huge deal for me because Steve’s music, instruments, and friendship have played a significant part in my life. To play a small part in the history of this incredible instrument is an indescribable honor. And it was awesome to get to hang out so much with Ed, learn even more about his awesome products, and get to know him better on a road trip to LA. He exposed me to some cool weird music I’ll be sharing at some point, too!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mike Keneally Talks To Andy West</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-context&quot;&gt;Some Context&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This conversation took place in my dining room on Sunday, November 13, 2016. It was the day after Mike and Andy performed a concert in that same dining room. I just thought it’d be cool if the two of them sat down and talked to each other on film since they’re old friends who hadn’t played together in years. It was a cool conversation!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/interview/mike-keneally&quot;&gt;Check out our interview with Mike Keneally!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/interview/andy-west&quot;&gt;And our interview with Andy West!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Julie works with Mike in all sorts of ways and BMP is a great company worth supporting. Check them out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interview-transcript&quot;&gt;Interview Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;Andy West: So Mike, I was listening to the radio on the way over here, and um, it was kind of a, uh…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Mike Keneally: They played a bunch of my stuff, didn’t they? [Laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: [Laughs] Yeah, exactly! It was fascinating, but there was a lot of this doom and gloom scenario about science and this kind of stuff, but you know, overlaid with this sense of hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Right, in terms of how technology can actually help us instead of hurt us. So, my question is: as someone who’s been a lifelong musician and in the business for so long, how do you… not a business question, but how do you see music evolving? Because it’s really struck me recently as I kind of continue to sort of look backwards and forwards at the same time, particularly with YouTube, you know, you can go see the videos of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelonius_Monk&quot;&gt;Monk &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and all the classic guys that are just extreme, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: Right. [Chuckles]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: And then, here we are now. So, do you ever think about or do you have any sense of kind of an evolutionary sort of thing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: I don’t have a shape or a pattern in my head. I do think about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: It’s fascinating to think about. But, I don’t know. I mean, you framed that by starting by talking about technology, and I recognize definite luddite tendencies in myself, you know, when I compare things that are happening now compared to… I mean, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I tend to idealize the early seventies as a period where musicianship was really fresh&lt;/span&gt;. The influences were still new enough so that the way they were being processed and recontextualized was really fresh feeling, and audio technology was just at a point in history in the early seventies that it produced a sound that seems amazingly good to me and a lot of other people. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I think there’s a reason why a lot of people intrinsically are so affectionate for the music of that era, and obviously a lot of it has a lot to do with what people were playing, but a lot of it also has to do with the way it sounded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: Just this really full and warm–and it’s very clichéd to use the word ‘warm’ when describing analog sound and analog technology, but most clichés have more than a grain of truth to them. I think that as digital recording technology started to take hold in the eighties, that it caused some kind of mass hypnosis, and many musicians with great ears that have been proven to have great ears got seduced and hypnotized a little bit by the clarity of digital. And &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;you listen to that stuff now and it’s almost unconscionable what was done to music&lt;/span&gt;. [Laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: [Laughs] Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: And that was accompanied by people starting to ratchet up compression in order to make things louder. So obviously everybody recognizes that the earliest digital recordings, especially in pop music in the eighties, a lot of it sounded really strange. So I think a lot has been done to compensate for that since then. And newer digital recordings are warmer, but they do arguably feel less human than the stuff that we were in love with and &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I think that that humanity is lost now&lt;/span&gt;. I say all that being super grateful for the flexibility of digital recording and the availability of the tools. All that is fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: But, as with so many things, it’s hard not to mourn what’s been lost, you know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Well I wonder if people are looking for that through various forms of live performance and things where people actually can attend. There’s kind of a renaissance of certain sort of jazz styles that are not like a rebirth of an old thing, but kind of an approach I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: OK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: I don’t know if you’ve heard somebody like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vijay_Iyer&quot;&gt;Vijay Iyer &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or something like that where it’s just kind of piano jazz but not really a standard jazz form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: OK. Sure. Oh yeah, sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: So let’s hope that that’s kind of mediating that other kind of influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: Well, yeah. I mean, definitely it’s out there. As with anything, there’s going to be an equal and opposite reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: Which is why you’re going to see a huge rise in progressive activism over the next few years. But I love that format that you’re describing. My friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mitchell_(pianist)&quot;&gt;Matt Mitchell &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who’s a keyboardist and composes for small jazz groups, sounds nominally like jazz but it heads in directions that are unpredictable, and you can feel the acquired knowledge and the exposure to all kinds of culture and music over the last many decades. It gets soaked into it. People will hear the word ‘jazz,’ and they think it’s going to sound like &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: But it’s all over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: “It must swing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: It’s all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: You know, I’m hearing a lot of things with more straight time and interesting rhythmic kind of things with these sort of harmonic overlays or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: I love that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: I mean, that’s fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah, that’s kind of cool. The other thing I’ve noticed, and maybe you can comment on this is…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: I don’t mean to make you ask all the questions, but I’m enjoying this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Ok cool. We’ve all…you know, people who have…I don’t want to say ‘studied music’, but sort of watched the evolution of players and musicianship over time. So in that time period when you were talking about, to actually discover a great musician was something that happened almost by serendipity or through some kind of filtered process of editorializing. I remember the first time I ever heard of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahivishnu_Orchestra&quot;&gt;Mahavishnu Orchestra &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for example, was in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creem&quot;&gt;Creem Magazine &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: It’s amazing that that’s where you went, because that’s…when you said that I precisely went to the first time I saw Mahavishnu Orchestra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah, but now it’s YouTube, right? As a bass player, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I’ve sort of had to come to grips with the fact that I could go on YouTube and find a hundred people that are just monstrous players that have technique and abilities that you just couldn’t find thirty years ago. It just didn’t exist.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: Uh-huh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: And now it does. So there’s some some cause for that effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: But &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I’m wondering if it’s kind of like there’s a lot of noise out there, and there’s this very high level of musicianship along with the noise.&lt;/span&gt; So it requires a filtering mechanism of say, “This is something that I can actually connect with, or not.” And the only way that I’ve found to do it is through my own trial and error, literally just going through and listening to stuff. And maybe that’s part of the evolutionary process that needs to develop here or something, which is some way to sort of… I don’t know if ‘editorialize’ is the right word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: Well, you can only rely on your instincts, and you’ve only got a limited amount of time in a day. It’s so much stuff to process and filter, that you kind of have to. Everyone does it. You go by first instincts when you get a link that someone has forwarded to you, and it’s one of 30 links that you’ve been momentarily intrigued by that day. And you don’t have time to watch them all. You have to, and that’s informed by all kinds of prejudices and things that you have to decide. “Am I going to listen to this thing that probably sounds like something I’ve heard before, or am I going to go this direction that might be more challenging?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And knowing you, I’m sure you probably tend to go for the more challenging things if you have a limited amount of time. But, if you have the time, you might say, “I just want a cross-section of what’s going on.” Or there’s a million reasons why you might be tempted to click on a link and see what’s going on. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;And there’s so much that I don’t see. I made peace with that many many years ago.&lt;/span&gt; And if someone hands me a disc on the road or something, I accept it graciously always and with gratitude. “Thank you for sharing this work with me.” And, you know, but &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;there’s probably a little part of me that’s like apologizing in advance saying, “There’s a good chance I won’t hear this.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: You know, I don’t say that out loud ‘cause I don’t want to, I don’t want to corrupt the moment, or…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: And you may!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: Or negatively influence anything. I might very well listen to it. But I know that at the end of every tour I end up with a stack of stuff and not the time to listen to all of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: OK, so actually, this leads to a story that Anthony can edit out if he wants. But it’s how I met him. Did I tell you this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: OK. Um? Tell me again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: OK. So Anthony and I worked at the same company down here in the Phoenix area. And he came to my office one day kind of cold and said, “Excuse me, but are you Andy West the bass player?” Which happens maybe eight or ten times in my entire thirty year computer career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: Really?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah. [Laughs] Not very often, but you know, interestingly more in the last ten years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: That makes sense to me. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;It takes time for this stuff to soak through the water supply.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: But the point is he came in, and he said, “Oh, well, that’s great. You know I’m a musician, blah blah blah.” And he gave me a CD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: OK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: And he said, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ahab.garone.net&quot;&gt;“This is a CD I made with my dad.” &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; And I said something to the effect of, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;“Ah that’s great. Yeah, I’ll definitely listen to it. By the way, I hate almost everything.”&lt;/span&gt; [Laughs] You know, or something to this effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: [Laughs] That’s great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: “You know, don’t take it personal, but I’ll definitely listen to it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: [Laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: And I listened to this album, and it was…I had probably a year earlier reread &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby_Dick&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moby Dick&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; again. It’s kind of like one of these books that I go back to every now and again. And it turns out that this album was conceptualizing the story of &lt;em&gt;Moby Dick&lt;/em&gt;. [Laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: Mmm hmm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Written by his dad, and Anthony played all the parts, and produced it, and all this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: Too cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: And this was like one of the… I’m looking for an adjective here. I can’t find an adjective to describe how I felt about this music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: Wow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: It was really interesting. Of course I love the story. And the lyrics and the melodies were very unusual, and it turns out his dad was you know, proudly unschooled. [Laughs] Like he would say, “Don’t ever try and teach me how to read music” or something, you know, “because I’m afraid it will corrupt me.” You know, kind of a weird attitude but…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;He had a voice, and he wanted to preserve it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah! So it was like he was in the Amazon living in the forest and did not want to come out. [Laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: He liked it there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: So it was just a very interesting story because this album, it’s not like something I would coldly recommend to anybody because it’s very eclectic and weird. So I was like, “God, what do I do with this? &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I love this, but I’m not going to tell everyone like ‘go listen to this album’ because they’ll think I’m nuts.&lt;/span&gt;” [Laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: I’ve run into that and I’ve become involved in projects specifically because I thought that the music was was so amazing and how could the world not love this, you know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Mmm hmm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: Sometimes I get a little clouded about that just because I think something is so amazing. I don’t know if I ever feel frightened that people will question my own sanity by recommending something. [Laughs] But then I know, yeah, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;you don’t just tell anybody that they should go check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trout_Mask_Replica&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trout Mask Replica&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah, right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: You gotta read the room. [Laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah, well Trout Mask… Ok, so just to jump haphazardly to another topic, you know when we first met, and you mentioned this &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Backwards_Alphabet&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crazy Backwards Alphabet&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: Album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Right. That I did with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Kaiser&quot;&gt;Henry Kaiser &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: That’s a really good album. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;That album was a real complete statement. And I like that record a lot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah. It’s a pretty neat thing. Now, because of course &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;on the internet, you’ll see all kinds of people say things, just really horrible things, about this stuff.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: Oh, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Like, “What were they thinking?” You know, this kind of thing. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;But we were thinking all kinds of things and just sort of playing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: [Laughs] That’s a good answer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: [Laughs] But it was fascinating to me because of course &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/captain-beefheart&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beefheart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was not part of my past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: OK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: I was sort of into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allman_Brothers&quot;&gt;Allman Brothers &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Led_Zeppelin&quot;&gt;Led Zeppelin &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream_(band)&quot;&gt;Cream &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you know, that whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: Right on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: And &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mothers_of_Invention&quot;&gt;The Mothers &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; too, for sure. But not, like, beyond The Mothers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: It didn’t go far… yeah, yeah. Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah. So Henry had me playing all these Captain Beefheart songs that I had never heard. And also the approach to the songs was so different because &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;it was not grounded in the kind of musical education that I had, which was very precise and harmonically, cohesive, and all this kind of stuff. So, it was very eye opening to me…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: It’s ’cause they’re tone paintings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: In a different kind of way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah. So that was pretty cool, and…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: Well, what I enjoyed hearing you play that kind of stuff, not just the Beefheart stuff, but the sort of Beefheart-influenced, uh, “Henry stuff” and whatnot, is how perfectly matched your approach and tone was for that kind of music. Like, I listened to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockette_Morton&quot;&gt;Rockette Morton &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, his bass playing on Trout Mask, and I see a taste of lineage…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: A parallel universe! [Laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: Yeah, well just that. I see a link between your style and his style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Well that’s interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: And it’s something to do with the attack on the strings and the musicality of it and the solidity of the sound and all this stuff. When I heard you in the seventies with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dixie_Dregs&quot;&gt;The Dregs &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it was all about precision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: And The Magic Band, the Beefheart stuff, is about discipline, because they had to practice those songs a million times to get all these disparate events to line up in any kind of way. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;But it’s not about precision in the accepted sense.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: But in a way it is ‘cause you gotta drill that stuff endlessly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: It’s crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Well ok, so in line with the original evolutionary sort of commentary, do you hear anything that is, I mean… What could you comment on besides yourself–which we can go to another topic on; I want to talk about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keneally.com/music/discography-mike-keneally/scambot1/&quot;&gt;Scambot &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; before you leave. But, do you hear any trends? Or is it just kind of like isolated, “Wow, this is a really interesting approach that these folks are doing or this guy is doing?” I mean, do you hear any kind of overall trending?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: I’m so out of touch. I mean, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I regret the fact that I don’t make the time to listen to everything that crosses my path.&lt;/span&gt; I would find it im…I clearly do find it impossible to do so, but there’s so much that passes me by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: But I wouldn’t presume to indicate my awareness of a trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Well, ok, so…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: But I hear good things a lot. Something will come out, and it might be years after it’s current, but I hear relatively new music. Like, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Thunes&quot;&gt;Scott Thunes &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; gave me a recording of the band &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_Music&quot;&gt;Field Music &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; like eight years ago or something. And I really enjoyed it. And then I sort of didn’t think about them anymore. And then &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Minnemann&quot;&gt;Marco Minnemann &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; became obsessed with the band Field Music, and then started playing it on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Satriani&quot;&gt;Satriani &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I realized I was aware of them. I had even heard their music years ago, and I went, “Yeah, that’s really good.” But then when I heard it a couple years ago again, I was reminded it’s actually really brilliant. It’s exciting. It’s beautifully constructed pop music, that, you know, in its field, it definitely deserves to stand alongside &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XTC&quot;&gt;XTC &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the best of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Rundgren&quot;&gt;Rundgren &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and all that stuff. And &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I love super well-constructed, non-predictable pop music very much.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I love a chord progression that is just beautiful. You don’t see where it’s going, but when it arrives, you realize, “Oh, that was the perfect solution nailed.”&lt;/span&gt; That stuff is so much fun for me. And Field Music has that in spades. So that’s reasonably new music that’s brilliant, and always my response when I hear something great unexpectedly is to be, you know, a little shocked. [Laughs] And then to be super super grateful to be reminded that I can be a curmudgeon as much as I want. But I can never really have the whole picture of everything that’s happening, and there’s always great stuff going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Well maybe it’s part of this evolutionary thing I keep harping on. The fact that there is a lot, but you have to discover it. Maybe it becomes more of a–it’s like a localized thing, you know? If you go back to the reason music is important to people, or why people love music, there’s an emotional thing there. There’s a human connection kind of thing that’s going on, or there should be. Right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: Ideally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I guess there are people that have never experienced a profound feeling from listening to music, but that would be very sad to me. You know?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: Oh, it would be. And &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;it’s only occasionally that something hits me that makes me need to go on the old social network platforms and share it.&lt;/span&gt; But when I saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar&quot;&gt;Kendrick Lamar &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at the Grammys earlier this year… Did you see that performance?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Maybe the single greatest musical performance I’ve ever seen on television.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Oh my God, ok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: And so I saw this and had to spread the word. It’s like, if you think nothing’s going on, wait ‘til you hear this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: It’s amazing. Not just the content of the words, which is powerful and huge, but also the actual content of the performance, and the band playing which was… They’re just like deadly great. And the musical conception, which is really evolved, and it’s endemic of now, what’s happening in the the sort of intersection between hip hop and DJ culture and jazz and spoken word and activism and all the stuff that’s coming together in an insanely powerful way. And which, you know, will continue to do so. That’s just like, I…I…Kendrick Lamar at the Grammys. That’s all I can say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah. I’m going to have to go look at that. That’s awesome. Here in Phoenix there’s a–I mean, I’ve looked, and &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;there’s kind of a dearth of opportunity for people to hear live music.&lt;/span&gt; You know, it’s really spare. There’s a local club here that is set up as a non-profit called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thenash.org&quot;&gt;The Nash &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is about jazz. But it’s purely jazz. Do you know what I mean? They’re not going to be doing other stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: OK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Which I think is kind of unfortunate ‘cause I think that there’s room for other stuff. And kind of like a pure music venue where people don’t need to go to buy drinks or, you know, the stupid thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: That’s why Anthony’s going to open the MWM Club.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah! Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: He’s not in the room. OK, we can, we can divulge all of his clients now. [Laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: [Laughs] Yeah right. It’s uh, it’s going to be right here in the living room. Of course his wife has got something to say about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: [Laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: No, it’s cool though. But you know, I think in New York or Boston there seems to be more of–maybe it’s just the concentration of cities. LA, you know, has the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Baked_Potato&quot;&gt;Baked Potato &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I guess the other side of that is really that now you go to the issue of musicians and artists creating and how do they support themselves? And then that opportunities become–well, you have to be very creative about this, and &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;if live performance is the only thing that’s gonna really do it, that’s an issue. But yet, we still do.&lt;/span&gt; I mean, people still create stuff no matter what. They’re driven to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Maybe that’s really the filter. You know, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;the filter is, “What are your motivations? What are your reasons?” And if they’re strong enough in the pursuit of expression, it’ll happen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: You find a way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: Yep. If that was a question, you just answered it. [Laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: [Laughs] I guess so. I’m just sort of musing on it, you know, because…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: Well, it’s good to think about, and it’s definitely good to check yourself every once in a while. Does your drive remain strong? Check your motives. And just keep putting one foot in front of the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: And you know, people who…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: That’s why I keep asking us that. [Laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: [Laughs] I have to put in a plug here for pragmatism too because I know a lot of musicians, and myself included, who have sort of taken a path of providing for themselves and their family through other means, having a day job, whatever. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;And back in the day, that used to be a real sort of sign of failure or something.&lt;/span&gt; You know, not necessarily a sign of failure, but it was not a sign of success. Right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: [Laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: And now I feel like it’s great if people can figure out how to make it work. There’s a lot of ways to do this, but again it kind of goes back to your motivation. And then sometimes they can kind of merge into a commercial successful thing, and sometimes not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: Well, it’s your motivation and also your specific intent. And, if your desire is simply to make music and not necessarily be out on the road for months at a time…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: …then all of a sudden it becomes very practical and real smart to find a way to fund those activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: You know I definitely have. I got involved with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_of_Rock&quot;&gt;School of Rock &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2007 and that was my attempt for a year at doing precisely that, holding down a day job. And it just became un-unworkable because by the end of that year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dethklok&quot;&gt;Dethklok &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was touring, and then suddenly there was an impasse that couldn’t be breached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: There’s certainly no stigma attached to it now, and I think it’s obviously laudable and quite necessary in a lot of cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Well you know, it’s, it’s another means, although um, you know, people who have a family and a job, and want to do music…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: …it’s really, you know, it can be a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: Well it is. I absolutely admire anyone who has the psychic space to encompass all of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah. So, what else is on your mind? [Laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: Oh man. I’m just grappling with my schedule all the time, which is challenging, so I’m a little self-centered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: Right now. So as soon as you said that all, I saw was stuff I have to do. You know, and that’s not at the expense… I don’t want this to be a political conversation so, obviously the, the election is on my mind, as it is on everyone’s. And, just going to have to see what happens there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: But, I’m feeling good. I just did a lot of live playing. I was out touring with &lt;em&gt;Beer for Dolphins&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Beller&quot;&gt;Bryan Beller &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.killuglyradio.com/wiki/Joe_Travers&quot;&gt;Joe Travers &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and then we wound up on election night at The Baked Potato.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: With &lt;a href=&quot;http://rickmusallam.com&quot;&gt;Rick Musallum &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; joining us.  We were a trio up until that last show, and then we were a quartet which I saw as sort of crossing the threshold in Beer for Dolphins activity next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Oh really? Awesome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: I want it to be a quartet with Rick whenever it’s possible. But then, it goes into finances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: Touring just now on the east coast and in the South and in the Midwest was so much more feasible with three players than it would have been with four.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: Even in terms of van space and just all kinds of logistics. And I’m looking at the really scant amount of money that I maybe made on the tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: [Laughs] Oh man. I know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: But then I had–I say that only because it’s fresh and on my mind. It’s an answer to your question. So, in December I’m out on the road with Satriani, for the month in South America. And that covers my expenditure that I just put out on my tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: So that’s the balance of my career anyway. You know, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I’m lucky enough to have these mainstream touring gigs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: With people that you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: With people that I like, and actually really enjoy playing with. And it’s like, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;playing Satriani music is so different from playing my own. I gain so much from it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: It’s the way he approaches these concise song forms and how he, with very small gestures melodically, just paints this complete picture that everyone responds to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah! Right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: And that’s really thought-provoking for me because I’m always searching for that thing way out there, you know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: And then &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Joe finds something right here next to you, and when you hear it, you realize, “Well that’s the perfect thing for that moment.”&lt;/span&gt; And then you watch people’s response to it in the audience, and it’s fascinating to me. What would be endless recombinations of musical information and what you can do. It’s so much fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: [Laughs] I know. When I listen–so of course I have all of the Satriani stuff, and I’ve seen you guys play with him many times. Well several times at least, and I also have a similar reaction in the sense that I’m in the audience so I’m kind of experiencing the music, but I’m also experiencing the audience and kind of fascinated by the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: Mmm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Well, it’s like: what is it that these people are really responding to? They’re responding to something that’s not something that I would normally conceive of, nor would I normally expect them to respond to what I’m hearing in the way that they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: Mmm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: So it’s, it’s really cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: Yeah!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: You know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: Yeah. Well, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;the basic themes are generally quite simple so people grasp that immediately take it in. The treatment is endlessly varied.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: It’s like there are subtleties of articulation when he approaches the same melody in different parts of the song.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: He’s really attuned to the emotional arc of a piece of music which a lot of anti-guitar hero people might be surprised to even consider because they think it’s just about fireworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: And of course the fireworks are a huge part of it, and that’s one of the things that keeps the audience kind of catalyzed and into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: It’s just these sounds and occasionally flagrant displays of technique because it’s exciting. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;People respond viscerally to somebody who’s really good doing something really well.&lt;/span&gt; [Laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: [Laughs] If they happen to show up, they will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: Yeah, exactly. Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: And, and that’s the other thing about Joe. Because of the way he conceives things melodically, he puts out music that people embrace. And so, he still has a major label deal after all these years, and still is able to do touring at a nice level of comfort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: And believe me, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;as a musician who is very reliant on well-paying jobs in order to feed my addiction of making my own music, I’m so grateful.&lt;/span&gt; You know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: …That that there is something like the Satriani gig where we get to tour nicely and play for a lot of people playing instrumental music that’s not the most immediately conventional thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: And that he gives me, and Beller, and Marco a place to be ourselves within this framework. It’s not a completely orchestrated thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah I definitely notice that. And you feel that. And I think that’s super smart and appropriate. And you guys have something to add. [Laughs] Obviously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: And Joe enjoys it. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Joe enjoys the fact that we’re adding that and the audience enjoys the fact that Joe is enjoying it, and that we’re doing whatever we’re doing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: The chemistry in the Satriani band right now is really cool, and kudos to Joe for wanting it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: And accepting it so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: I agree. Oh, You want to wrap it? [Laughs] Okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: You got any requested topics, Mr. G?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;Anthony Garone: No, I think this is great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: Can we talk about the first three &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_(band)&quot;&gt;Chicago &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; albums? Were you into them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: [Laughs] You know, I think I was, but I think I was &lt;strong&gt;then&lt;/strong&gt;. [Laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: OK, when’s the last time you heard that stuff?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: Yeah? Check it out. Actually, I really like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_V&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chicago V&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The first five…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: They’re playing here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: Some version of Chicago?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah, some version of them is playing here. I mean, I’m sure they’re playing those songs and probably better than they did then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: I don’t know. I’m a real &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Kath&quot;&gt;Terry Kath &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; enthusiast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Oh, ok. All right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: And I’m also a real &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Seraphine&quot;&gt;Danny Seraphine &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; enthusiast, the drummer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: So there was, there’s a chemistry on the way those players sounded together on, for me, the first five records especially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: I saw them play at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_International_Pop_Festival_(1970)&quot;&gt;The Atlanta Pop Festival &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: Oh, well that’s cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: And they were great. And you know, horns seem to be making a comeback. [Laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: Well, I was just thinking about popular music that stretches the conventions and they popped into my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah. Nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: Those records–just to wax nostalgic for second about a time when &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Records&quot;&gt;Columbia Records &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; would fund the first three Chicago albums, which were double albums with all sorts of weird musical experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: With, you know, a million different genres and then just doing whatever they wanted. The fourth album was a live album that was four disks. [Laughs] You know, the four record set…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: [Laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: …with about eighteen pounds of posters in it. You know, they could do whatever wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah, right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: And &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;the marketplace was supporting that.&lt;/span&gt; And, I don’t know, I wouldn’t argue with anybody who doesn’t dig Chicago, but I have a real–obviously sentimental, but also I think somewhat logical–affection for them and that early Chicago stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: Cool. Well, it’s at least added to my YouTube list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: There ya go! Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: I’ll check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: [Laughs] Well, ok. We good?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: Thank you. Make weird music! [Everyone laughs.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AW: All right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MK: See ya.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Decay of Cities by Henry Cow</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;video&quot;&gt;Video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZvwNC4cmP5E?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;soundslice-notation-and-tablature&quot;&gt;Soundslice Notation and Tablature&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Living sheet music brought to you by &lt;a href=&quot;http://soundslice.com&quot;&gt;Soundslice &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Wanna know more? Check out &lt;a href=&quot;/gear/soundslice&quot;&gt;our interview with Soundslice co-creator, Adrian Holovaty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.soundslice.com/scores/61172/embed/&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://thegabrielconstruct.com&quot;&gt;Gabriel Lucas Riccio &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for his help with this transcription.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;context&quot;&gt;Context&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cow&quot;&gt;Henry Cow &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Culture_(album)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Western Culture&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is one of my favorite records, if not my absolute favorite record ever. It’s extremely challenging for the first several listens. Like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Bloom&quot;&gt;Harold Bloom &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;’s first attempts at reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cormac_McCarthy&quot;&gt;Cormac McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_Meridian&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blood Meridian&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where he threw the book across the room three times before he could finish it, this album was unlistenable noise to me for many years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I started to understand &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motif_(music)&quot;&gt;motivic composition &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I began to understand this record and appreciate its beauty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I’ve wanted to transcribe this piece for a long time and the idea had been eating away at me for the past few weeks, so here we are. There are lots of tricks to playing it, so make sure you listen to the original recording before you try playing through the transcription.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the feedback I got when I posted this video, there’s more demand for Henry Cow transcriptions than I ever thought imaginable. If you’d like to see more, let me know!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interview-transcript&quot;&gt;Interview Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Hi, this is Anthony with MakeWeirdMusic.com and I have &lt;a href=&quot;http://courtneyswain.com&quot;&gt;Courtney Swain &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with me, all the way from Rhode Island. Courtney, thank you for joining us today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CS: Hey Anthony, hello!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: I’d like for our audience to get to know who you are and a bit about your musical background, so would you mind introducing yourself and then telling us about some of the projects with which you’ve been associated?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CS: Sure. My name’s Courtney Swain, I live in Rhode Island right now and my main lead project is I do lead vocals and keyboards for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bent_Knee&quot;&gt;Bent Knee &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which is a Boston-based sort of art rock/experimental rock band. I also perform in &lt;a href=&quot;http://ben-levin.squarespace.com/&quot;&gt;Ben Levin Group &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;/interview/ben-levin&quot;&gt;Ben Levin was on Make Weird Music recently&lt;/a&gt;. He’s a wonderful guitarist and he also plays guitar in Bent Knee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I also have a solo project that I have mainly been pursuing as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPM_Challenge&quot;&gt;RPM Challenge &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; kind of capacity, where I go and record all my ideas in one month, sort of as a challenge to myself to just put it out there without judging and see what happens. So those are my main things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: And you sing and play keyboards. Anything else?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CS: No. I wish I played a guitar or something, but I don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: And how did you meet Ben?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CS: I was at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berklee_College_of_Music&quot;&gt;Berklee College of Music &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Boston at the same time that Ben was. Berklee has really changed over the last five or six years, they have a bunch of new buildings and a nice new cafeteria full of sunlight now but before, it used to be in this basement 2 floors below ground level. No one got service and it was really dank and everyone would just go there and talk to each other and it was sort of like a forced “meet people” - well, it wasn’t forced. Anyways, that’s where we met. Ben was a year ahead of me and his roommate was Vince [Welch] who is the producer of our bands and he kind of had a huge community of people and our group of bands sort of grew out of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: That’s cool. I know Ben’s in like, 20 bands or something, and I know you’re in several of them. Which acts are you in besides Bent Knee and Ben Levin Group?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CS: Those are the only two right now, actually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Oh, really?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nac_Wn9djNc&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CS: Yeah. I used to be in our drummer’s group, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mrgavinsmeatfarm.bandcamp.com/&quot;&gt;Mr Gavin’s Meat Farm &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and I also, for a hot second, was in our bassist’s group, &lt;a href=&quot;https://justicecow.bandcamp.com/&quot;&gt;Justice Cow &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but I’m very impatient and I can be sort of a bitch to work with and I sort of had to leave. This was four or five years ago and I don’t think there’s any bad blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: And you guys have been doing a lot of touring. You just toured Europe, you’ve done a bunch of U.S. shows. Can you tell us about your new album and what you’re promoting on the tour?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CS: Yep. We released our third full-length record from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cuneiformrecords.com/&quot;&gt;Cuneiform Records &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in May, that was our first album that came out through them. The album’s called &lt;a href=&quot;https://bentknee.bandcamp.com/album/say-so&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Say So&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and we were touring from the first weekend of May until the last weekend of September. We ended up playing, like, fifty-three shows across six countries and it was a lot of fun. We played about fifty shows last summer too, but that really was an arduous experience because we didn’t take any breaks, we never went back. There were times where we stopped on the road and we didn’t have shows for three days and it was a vacation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But, I think, when you spend that much time with people in such close quarters, you really just need time away from them so when we got back last year it was just like “ahh…” But this year we took breaks and we paced it much better so we did three separate tours instead of one huge tour. So it went much better. Bent Knee’s been doing really well. There’s been a lot of great things happening to the band and so it’s really exciting to go out and actually see people at our shows because it was not that long ago when we we were playing to like, three people - we still loved it but it’s even better when there’s like thirty people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah. The new album is just amazing. I was listening to most of it yesterday while driving around and my wife has heard some of it and she’s the biggest critic of the music that I listen to but one the thing that has stood out is your vocal capabilities. She’s a singer, too and she’s like “The singer of Bent Knee is such a great singer.” Can you tell us about your background and formation as a singer and piano player?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CS: Sure! I was a piano player for way longer than I was a singer. I started playing piano when I was in kindergarten, when I was four or five, and I studied classical all the way up to middle high school. And I used to practice an hour a day, not because I liked to but because my parents were very patient and made me do it. I sort of started singing–I grew up in Japan and when you’re in high school in Japan the two big social things you do is you go bowling and then you go to karaoke. I don’t know if that’s the same here, but–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: No, it’s not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/0hpU8Jwp5ic&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CS: That was a thing to do and so I started going to karaoke a lot and I really loved singing, and I felt like it was something where people were very encouraging and they were like “Yeah, this is something you can do!” and my brother had gone to–he’s six years older than me, he’d gone to an ivy league school and the experience was a lot to for him to deal with, and I was just thinking about going to a liberal arts school, too, but I was sort of got worried that I was going to be crushed by the academics, and it was just sort of like “Well, I’m only going to get one chance to go to college so I want to go to music school,” randomly because my mom suggested it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So I applied to Berklee after the audition cutoff for Tokyo. I emailed them and I was like “Hey, I know this is too late, like you’re coming to Tokyo in three weeks, will you let me audition?” and they were like “Yeah, whatever, sure.” So I went to Tokyo and I auditioned with singing to which all my relatives were like “What are you talking about? We went to all your stupid classical piano recitals for fifteen years and you’re not going to use any of those skills?” but I accompanied myself and &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I’m pretty sure I got into Berklee because I could play piano, I don’t think it was my singing that got me in&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And then, I got to Berklee and my first class, they were counting off, they were like “Alright, we’re gonna play this song.” and I didn’t know this was two and four. So I was like “Why do I keep coming in a beat before everyone else?” I’d be like [way off] and I was like “I don’t know anything!” and so it was like a real awakening for me because my parents didn’t listen to jazz or anything besides like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Led_Zeppelin&quot;&gt;Led Zeppelin &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream_(band)&quot;&gt;Cream &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creedence_Clearwater_Revival&quot;&gt;Creedence Clearwater Revival &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart&quot;&gt;Mozart &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach&quot;&gt;Bach &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven&quot;&gt;Beethoven &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, I was learning all this and I was trying to sing and learn to sing better and it was sort of a real downer. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I just kinda got really depressed at my ability to sing because I just had had no formal instruction.&lt;/span&gt; The only thing I had going for myself was that I had good pitch so I could sing everything in tune but my tone was not very good. I was not doing it in a healthy way and also I think Berklee’s voice department tends to gravitate towards supporting people who have a big R&amp;amp;B, kind of pop diva kind of voice and I really don’t have that yet. I also wasn’t really interested in having that type of tone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So I ended up just sort of feeling like an outcast but a large part of my development as a singer really came from working with Ben in a way because the reason Ben and I started collaborating was he wanted to do an improvised choir, sort of like what &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_McFerrin&quot;&gt;Bobby McFerrin &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was doing, essentially, with his singers. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;But Ben wanted to do with his guitar and a group of singers so he would be like, “Let’s sing in the color of blue.” And I was there with a couple of my friends and I was like “This guy is cool!” Like, I get it, you know?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And I felt like no one else did so I told him “Dude, you know, we should pursue this connection.” And then we started writing and in that process when we started recording I started sitting down with myself in a practice room with a microphone and I would record and then listen back and be like “No, this is not right, this is not right.” So I would just keep doing it until I thought it sounded exactly the way that I wanted it to. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;And I think that’s the real way that I learned how to sing and to really develop my style was through this feedback loop of need and what I wanted to sound like.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/TCfU_WkJ1KM&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: That’s great. And do you have other responsibilities in the band than just performing? Do you help write the songs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CS: Yeah! We all write together. Even the lyrics. So, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;someone will bring in a seed of a song and then we’ll pull it apart and re-expand it into like, this thing.&lt;/span&gt; And things come in at different degrees of doneness, so sometimes it will be an entire song with all verses, sometimes it’ll just be an idea, sometimes it will be a song with one verse. But there’s three that mostly contribute the songs. That’s Ben, our bass player Jessica, and myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, I try to write and bring in some stuff that will be good for the band. I also do a lot of e-mailing. The violin player Chris and I have been doing a lot of the admin side work which luckily, now that the band is gaining an audience is being offset a little bit with some outside help, which is great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Absolutely. Can you tell us about how much growth you’ve seen with this new album? I’m seeing it pop up all over Facebook and Twitter. I know I follow you guys, but it seems like you’re getting lots of rave reviews. Can you tell us where you were before this album and what do you think happened as a result of it and why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CS: Yeah, that’s a great question. I would actually take a step back further to talk about why this album happened, in a way, if that’s okay?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Go for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/sqx3xfVQXSo&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CS: I think, when we put out &lt;a href=&quot;https://bentknee.bandcamp.com/album/shiny-eyed-babies&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shiny Eyed Babies&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on November 11th in 2014, we were invited to do &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.converse-music.com/rubbertracks/&quot;&gt;Converse Rubber Track &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sessions at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.qdivision.com/&quot;&gt;Q Division &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Somerville, Massachussetts and so we recorded a version of &lt;em&gt;Leak Water&lt;/em&gt;. There’s a version on &lt;em&gt;Say So&lt;/em&gt;, which is the newer one but this was the first song that we had already finished off the new album back in 2014. So we tracked that and then we had this big meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shiny Eyed Babies&lt;/em&gt; was the first time we got a real press hit. We were actually gonna release it in July but &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Needle_Drop&quot;&gt;The Needle Drop &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Anthony Fantano, featured it and then we got this explosion of attention and we were like “Oh, this is what it means to get a press hit.” And so we were like, “Okay, let’s push the release back 4 months to see if we can get a PR company and get more buzz.” And &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;through the experience we sort of learned what it means to have a release timeline and to work with a publicist.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So when we sat down on November 11th, we were like “This is good, &lt;em&gt;Shiny Eyed Babies&lt;/em&gt;, great album, okay. What are we gonna do next?” And we laid out this timeline of when we wanted to have the music and what we wanted to accompany the release like music videos and a PR agency or a label, all this stuff. So it was very much kind of a planned, deadlined focus production as opposed to &lt;em&gt;Shiny Eyed Babies&lt;/em&gt; which took like, 2 or 3 years because we were learning to write with each other and there was no deadline. It was just like, it will be done when it will be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So we wrote really, really hard in the beginning of 2015. Vince and I were commuting up from Providence to Boston to rehearse and you know, we would be in Boston like 2 or 3 nights a week. Winter is exhausting in New England, too, just because there’s so little daylight and it just gets really dank and it was really hard to finish the album but we did and then we played 50 shows of that album, just trying it out in front of audiences to see if it works. And after we got really good at playing it, we went in and recorded it right after we got off of tour and we were so good at playing the songs that it took us one day to finish basics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/o7mERyfchWE&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So we got in the studio and they set up until like 11 or noon or 1, we got all the sounds. And by nine or ten we were done tracking all 10 songs. It was pretty crazy. And right around that time, this guy called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anil_Prasad&quot;&gt;Anil Prasad &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; who has a great online music blog called &lt;a href=&quot;http://innerviews.com&quot;&gt;Innerviews &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you probably know about it. But he found out about us and posted about us and people started hearing about us and Anil was like, “Why isn’t more stuff happening for you?” And &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;he connected the dots so that we were able to work with Cuneiform Records.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Cuneiform has been around for about 2 decades, maybe more. I forget. And they have a really close following of people who are really interested in what they do. They’re not a big label but &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;they’re a really honest label that is really built on relationships.&lt;/span&gt; So when we got signed to Cuneiform, even before we were anywhere close to releasing the album, we started seeing more people at our shows. People were just interested just because Cuneiform was interested. And for that I am really eternally grateful to Cuneiform because they were the first real big tastemakers that said, “Check this out, this is a band that people should be listening to.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So the baseline of how many people we see per show just went up wherever we went, even if we played a new place. And we’ve been playing our music really hard and we play a lot so one thing that we can always rely on is that we always play our music really well when we play live. And I think it’s served us well because those new people who came to see us because of Cuneiform were, I think, always really blown away by our performances. We have this running joke in the band that everyone’s always really nice to us after we play because &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;we are a really weird bunch of people and sometimes people have a bad day or something, but after we play, they’re like, “Hey, we like you guys!”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;With Cuneiform, the kind of baseline of people coming to our shows went up and we were also able to secure &lt;a href=&quot;http://girlieaction.com&quot;&gt;Girlie Action &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is a New York-based PR company that worked with us. They helped us put out our music videos and live videos to more people so that there was a bigger audience waiting for that stuff as it was being rolled out. I guess a big lesson we learned during &lt;em&gt;Shiny Eyed Babies&lt;/em&gt; is that &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;news and press really don’t care about an album once it’s out. They want to be the first people to know about it, so they want to do premieres, they want to premiere videos, but once your album is out, they just don’t want to touch it. They’re like, “It’s out. Anyone can listen to it. No big deal.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/9s7XwPw4Ie4&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But with Girlie Action, they have a lot of firepower and the biggest thing they got us was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wsj.com/articles/say-so-by-bent-knee-review-1464125585&quot;&gt;the Wall Street Journal feature &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We had a writeup in the Wall Street Journal and this was huge. It’s actually still huge as we are working with more people and as we are working towards our next album. I guess Jim Fusilli, the writer who did the article, is this guy who’s really well respected as a writer and a lot of people try to get him to “write this, please!” and he doesn’t. So people sort of turned heads at the fact that he wrote this piece on us. Again that was one of those things that kind of bumped our baseline of how many people are showing up to shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;The biggest thing that happened recently on the heels of &lt;em&gt;Say So&lt;/em&gt; and after all the touring was that we got an opening slot for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dillinger_Escape_Plan&quot;&gt;Dillinger Escape Plan &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;’s final tour. And &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; really bumped it to the next level. We’ve been seeing people from a different demographic, too, because this whole year we’ve sort of been receiving a lot of love from the prog community. They’re so wonderful and it’s funny because &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;every time we play a show, there’s always this one older person in the back and they all joke like, “Yeah, I’m the old guy in the back.” They’re so easy to spot and they’re so kind to us, but we, being young, never thought of ourselves as “prog.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s kind of a concern where we thought, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;“Are we going to get stuck in prog?”&lt;/span&gt; Then the Dillinger thing happened and it was perfect timing. So we’re seeing a lot of younger people. It’s interesting now going onto the Facebook page of Bent Knee. It’s a different experience because I have no idea who the people are that are talking about us. It’s not just our friends and our moms and dads and uncles and aunts. It’s actual people I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Fans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CS: Yeah yeah! They sort of treat us as such, too. When we put something out, they’re like, “Oh shit! New Bent Knee!” It’s really exciting that that’s happening. Yeah, so that’s sort of how it feels on this end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: So tell me a little about how growing up in Japan has influenced your songwriting and your musicianship and what that brought to your Berklee experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CS: Yeah, really interesting question. I think it’s hard to say what it really is because I don’t have the experience of not growing up in Japan. I don’t know what it would be like if I had not gone through that. I think it’s made things a lot more complicated, for better or for worse. When I listen to the first Bent Knee album–I’ve spoken English all my life. I was double schooled, so I went to Japanese public schools, but my dad was also home schooling me in English. So, it’s my second language and I speak it fluently, but it’s not quite native. When I first came to college, people were like, “What’s your accent?” And I never realized that I had an accent, so I was really wigged out by that question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Now, when I go back and listen to the first album, I sort of understand what people were talking about.&lt;/span&gt; I don’t finish my words. I don’t know if that makes sense, but when you listen to it, the vowels sort of drag on, but the consonants don’t come at the end at the right time. I think that’s because in Japanese, consonants get placed in a different place. When I went to Japan in February–my hearing is fine, I’m a musician but I have fine hearing, but I kept missing my friend’s words. I kept saying, “What’d you say? What’d you say?” I wasn’t hearing them. I just wasn’t used to listening to where their consonants were that I wasn’t focused on hearing those things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I had a real identity crisis growing up in Japan because there’s just no one who looks caucasian in my town. My dad, my brother, myself… And I knew maybe 5 or 6 other people who weren’t Japanese. But, I heavily identify as being Japanese inside. I’m really interested in Japanese history and I’m really interested in Japanese mannerisms and colloquialisms and sort of wit and humor. So, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;it was a real struggle feeling rejected from a culture that I felt like I’d really earned and I really identified with.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/BAmUFbE93Is&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;When I came to college, especially in collaborating so closely with other people, I really quickly learned that &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Japanese communication is not a very good communication style to have when you want to work within the arts and be really honest and forthcoming and brutal and also emotional with other people.&lt;/span&gt; There is an episode of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_American_Life&quot;&gt;This American Life &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/597/one-last-thing-before-i-go&quot;&gt;they were talking in this phone booth in Northern Japan &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where the tsunami hit and it’s not connected to anything. People just go there and talk to the deceased or the lost just to talk about it and in that piece, they did a really great job articulating how–I’ve never told my mom or my aunts that I love them. It’s just not something that you say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I don’t think I ever hugged my grandma. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;It doesn’t mean I didn’t love her or have an understanding that we were both there together, but that sounds really absurd to an American. It’s like, “WHAT? You never hugged your grandma?!”&lt;/span&gt; It’s that kind of disconnect where something I thought was so normal that I didn’t even think about or realize is just so far removed from what the social norm is in terms of communicating with people in the US. So, I really had to re-learn how to express myself at all. For a long time, I felt like I never had an opinion and I just was going with whatever everyone else’s opinion was. It’s a very Japanese groupthink kind of thing. Whatever is the predominant opinion, we’ll go with that. Bow and smile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I think that was the biggest thing for me in college and in music, just learning to communicate in a different culture. It’s the most difficult thing. It’s been difficult, but at the same time, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;it’s really helped the group establish ground rules and a deeper understanding for how we communicate with each other.&lt;/span&gt; And also the openness and honesty to be able to call each other out and to excel in being better friends and better people. Or at least that’s how I like to think about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: You said you didn’t have a whole lot of musical variety growing up, but Bent Knee is such a musically diverse band. I would imagine when you got to Berklee, you were exposed to all sorts of genres and bands and even instruments that you might not have had growing up the way you did. Has that been kind of a musical awakening or do you feel like you’re pretty firmly set in the roots you established in Japan and that’s what you bring to the songwriting and lyric writing experience?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/c16ya0MXXjE&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CS: I think I’ve definitely moved on from my roots. I think they’re still very important albums to me on an emotional level, but I always am surprised in a way when people talk about Bent Knee being so “jazzy.” Then I go and listen to songs like &lt;em&gt;Nakami&lt;/em&gt; from the new album. It’s like, “Okay, I get it,” but when I came to Berklee, I couldn’t improvise. I was a classical player so I couldn’t improvise on the piano. So I’ve had this infatuation for the last decade since I came to Berklee, like, “I want to play jazz.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;That was one of those things that really opened my eyes. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I think a lot of my musical awakening is really fueled by Ben, our guitar player, and Chris, our violin player. I’m not a very good music listener. I am at music performing.&lt;/span&gt; That’s what I love doing. I love performing music. I love writing music after that and then at the end, I like listening to music. That sounds really sad, but I just realize that especially with Bent Knee growing, there are people who are listening to Bent Knee because they love listening to music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I’ve never really had that experience where I’m just listening to music hungrily looking for something new. I get tired of my own playlists or my own albums all the time because the way I listen is I’ll find something new and I’ll listen to it until I just stop listening and then I won’t listen to music for a while. In times like that, and the way I find new music, is through Chris, who’s an avid music listener. He’s always, always listening to and reading NPR, he watches all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR_Music&quot;&gt;Tiny Desk Concerts &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He listens to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_Exploder&quot;&gt;Song Exploder &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a great podcast. Stuff like that. Through him, I have been exposed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Son_Lux&quot;&gt;Son Lux &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; whose &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Are_Rising&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;We Are Rising&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the RPM album he did, is really cool. That was a really big influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And then Ben also, whenever he gets into something, he really digs deep. His influences show very clearly on the music writing of Bent Knee. If Ben gets into something, it’s inevitable you’re going to know it really really well, whether you like it or not. You also get the whole commentary and discussion on what is really happening and what is the significance of a texture and what is the historical background of something. He ends up really breaking it down. So that’s where I get most of my musical awakening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;My biggest influences right now are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanza_Spalding&quot;&gt;Esperanza Spalding &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiona_Apple&quot;&gt;Fiona Apple &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I guess one influence that I haven’t been able to–not “get rid of” like it’s bad–but it still sticks with me is a Japanese artist named &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringo_Sheena&quot;&gt;Shena Ringo &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Her second album is really deep and really wonderful. When I listen–I went back and listened to it recently and I thought that when I listen to it, I don’t feel like I’ve moved that much because the different creative sampling and the darkness and the depth of the lyrics and the emotional delivery of what she’s doing doesn’t really seem like it’s that far, but at the same time, I think I was always trying to get there. Now I can actually do that, but in the past I don’t think I was able to make that quality of material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4BUfvoQjza4&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Have you ever crossed paths with Esperanza Spalding? She’s incredible, Berklee grad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CS: No, I have not. When I came to Berklee, everyone hated Esperanza Spalding. I shouldn’t generalize, but people were talking about her. I went to see her once and I was kind of like, “I don’t get it.” I think she was playing solo and I heard a lot of “doo-bee-dee-ba-doo-ba-doo-bah.” And I was like, “What?” I think maybe I was just in a bad place, but when she put out this new album, I was like, “Urrrggghhh.” I had sort of judged her without really listening to her music or really digging deep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily&#39;s_D%2BEvolution&quot;&gt;The &lt;em&gt;D+Evolution&lt;/em&gt; album &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CS: Yeah, I heard her on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wait_Wait..._Don%27t_Tell_Me!&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wait… Wait Don’t Tell Me!&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/2016/03/26/471846283/not-my-job-jazz-bassist-esperanza-spalding-gets-quizzed-on-bases&quot;&gt;She was hilarious &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and–what’s his name? &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Sagal&quot;&gt;Peter Sagal &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;–was like, “So you were the youngest professor at Berklee. What was that like?” She was just like, “Yeah, it was great. I just don’t think it was great for my students, though.” They were just like, “Do you want to teach?” and like any good musician, I was like, “Yes!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;You say yes to everything. When she said that, I was like, “That makes sense.” I have definitely, as a musician, walked into things that I’m way underqualified for just because someone offered it. I was like, “Yeah, I’m going to do this. I’m going to rock it.” I was so impressed that she just owned up to it and was so relaxed about it. Then I just went and listened to the album and was like, “WOW. This is crazy!” I haven’t gone through her back catalog, but I’m still really enjoying and savoring this &lt;em&gt;D+Evolution&lt;/em&gt; album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah, there are so many great songs on several of her previous albums. I do encourage you to invest in some of it. It’s extremely different from &lt;em&gt;Emily’s D+Evolution&lt;/em&gt;, but really good stuff. If I remember correctly, you were a key part of some of the music videos you guys have made recently, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CS: Yeah. I was involved heavily in the &lt;em&gt;Good Girl&lt;/em&gt; video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Do you have a photography or film background?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/KCSsuwHpYo8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CS: No, not at all. As Bent Knee, we tried to do a music video for our first album. We actually tried to do two. There is one out there called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCSsuwHpYo8&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Urban Circus&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; we did with a friend who was a film student. There’s another one that got canned because it just didn’t come out right. It was such an arduous and difficult process that we didn’t even really get to doing any music videos for &lt;em&gt;Shiny Eyed Babies&lt;/em&gt;. I think it was just because we tried to apply the same concept of writing music to writing a music video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;With writing music, the difference is that &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;we’re able to articulate and sort of make an example of our ideas really well so that it makes sense to each other what we’re trying to envision.&lt;/span&gt; A lot of times, if you say a musical idea, it sounds so stupid. So we have this rule in rehearsal where we always have to try everything. You just have to try it and you can’t just be like, “I hate it.” You have to try building up on it instead of slashing it down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;With music videos, I think the problem was when we discussed it together, no one could really articulate their ideas fully without relying on other videos or ideas or imagery.&lt;/span&gt; We just weren’t on the same page about what we wanted to do, but we would do the same thing we do with music where we just hodge-podge it together. “Okay, let’s start with Gavin’s idea here and then we’ll switch over to this idea here, which was Jessica’s. And then we’ll put Courtney’s idea here.” We were trying to create this Frankenstein and it just wasn’t working, you know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;When we were trying to do videos for &lt;em&gt;Say So&lt;/em&gt;, this was in December and January of 2016–my mom is a dancer and she has a non-profit type of dance and arts kind of organization in Fukuoka, Japan. I was going back in Japan in February. We always sort of joked about collaborating. As long as I can remember when I started playing piano, my mom would be like, “Oh, one day we’ll collaborate.” It was just this running joke and then I was like, “No, this is something I really want to do.” I had brought it up to her when we were thinking of doing a video for &lt;em&gt;In God We Trust&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Shiny Eyed Babies&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I’d just sent her an email a couple years back and she called me back on FaceTime and she was crying because she was so overwhelmed by the emotion of someone seeing her as a dancer and respecting her art. She’s not a lifelong dancer, she started later in her 30s and 40s, more as a health thing. Then she really got into it. She’s older now and she does more admin and organizational stuff than actual physical dancing. So, seeing that, it was kind of like, “Wow, this is really something that means a lot to my mom.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/FgUNBRFnYM8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So when I was going back to Japan, I really wanted to do a video with her and I thought &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgUNBRFnYM8&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Good Girl&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; would be great because I wasn’t sure how many resources we’d have when we’re back in Japan. I was trying to think of something that could really just rely on her dancing and not a lot of props. I just wrote the storyboard myself and I sent it to everyone for feedback. My approach was just like, “I’m going to make this. I’m going to make it the best I can and I’m going to hope everyone likes it. I don’t want to do the process we’ve been doing where we hodge podge ideas because I think I have a really good vision for this and I want to try making it a thing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, my mom being in the arts, she has some great connections. We were able to find a really good videographer who also did the editing, and also the lighting and stage tech guy who provided the lighting and the smoke machine, which makes everything better for the shoot. Yeah, we did it in Japan in this sort of empty gallery space that’s in the same building as my mom’s office and also sort of in the backyard of one of my mom’s best friends who has a house in the mountains. About that shoot, if you go look towards the end and you see my mom dancing in nature, she has this wig on backwards and she’s wearing barely nothing and it was February in the mountains with ice melt and she’s dancing in this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Myself and the two videographers are wearing these heavy coats and just walking around weeping at how cold our feet are because we’re in this water. Of course the first thing that happens when my mom starts dancing is she falls and slips right into the water. We’re like, “Oh shit!” But she was just in a different plane where she didn’t even feel cold. She was like, “It doesn’t bother me.” It also made me realize I have that thing, too, when I start performing, I have this switch that goes on and I just go to a different place. I realized, “Oh, this is where I get it from.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I could not get my mom to rehearse to save my life. She was just not there, but when we put her in the environment and we said, “Go, do your thing.”&lt;/span&gt; She was just there and it was such an amazing experience to see your parent really being a person and an artist as opposed to being a parent. To get to collaborate on that artist to artist level was a really extremely rewarding experience for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: That’s awesome. One final question: About that switch you just mentioned, the intensity switch, you’re such an intense live performer, when you’re singing, there’s nothing else in the world happening. Have you always been that way or is that something that Bent Knee has brought out of you in terms of singing and performing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CS: Yeah, I think–I don’t know. I guess for me, I haven’t really found a different way to perform. I really am a performer. I think that’s the thing that I do the best and the thing that I really love doing. Bent Knee material is becoming less cathartic. It’s not as brutal. I don’t think anything else will ever be quite as brutal as &lt;em&gt;Shiny Eyed Babies&lt;/em&gt;, save for some tragedy that I hope won’t happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shiny Eyed Babies&lt;/em&gt; we wrote just as we were graduating college. It was a really tumultuous time. We weren’t sure what was going to happen with our lives. We were working really hard on the band, but nothing was really happening yet. So, a lot of emotional stuff and I felt like it just had to be delivered that way. It wasn’t a conscious decision that I made. It’s just something that I’ve always done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Cool. Well, thank you so much for giving me about an hour of your time. I really appreciate that. I really hope you have a great birthday today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CS: Thank you so much. I really appreciate your really thoughtful questions. I’m sorry I’m such a rambler. I feel like you should have asked more questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: I told you: Everyone says that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;CS: I know! I know! You’re just such a great listener. That’s the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: It’s the cross I have to bear I guess. All right, thanks so much Courtney.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New Morgan Ågren Releases</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-releases&quot;&gt;New Releases&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2016, we did &lt;a href=&quot;/interview/morgan-agren&quot;&gt;a lengthy interview with Morgan Ågren&lt;/a&gt; and he mentioned a couple new releases to be released later in the year. Well, it’s December 2016 and the releases are–well, released. I thought it’d be cool to hear Morgan himself tell us about the new CDs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://morganagren.bandcamp.com/album/through-the-eyes-of-a-morgchestra&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Through the Eyes of a Morgchestra&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://morganagren.bandcamp.com/album/35th-anniversary-collection-2cd-25-hours&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mats/Morgan 35th Anniversary Collection&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;video&quot;&gt;Video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to Morgan for chatting with us again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;transcription&quot;&gt;Transcription&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Hi, this is Anthony with MakeWeirdMusic.com and I have with me today, all the way from Sweden, Morgan Ågren. Morgan, thank you so much for joining. I really appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MA: Well, it’s my pleasure. I saw some other people that you have online here, so it’s my pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: So you have two new releases out and I thought it’d be cool to hear in your own words what they are and what they mean to you. So, go ahead!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MA: Yeah! Actually, two albums happened just very recently and neither of these albums were really planned as a regular release. One of them is this one [holds up the CD], which is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://morganagren.bandcamp.com/album/through-the-eyes-of-a-morgchestra&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Through the Eyes of a Morgchestra&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and it features the music that we performed with the symphony orchestra two months ago. I started to compose for this project a year ago, like in October 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;While doing that, in order to be able to do music for the symphony orchestra, I needed to have sounds to allow me to hear how it could possibly sound later. So, I installed good string plugins and bassoons and all the orchestra. Then slowly I started to try to build up the music and 6 months later, without having even thought about it, I just realized one day when I went through the material, “Hmm, this sounds like an album.” When I realized that, I started to work on the music so it would be good for release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/DyfNjA7ApCs&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;At that moment it was almost good enough for release, but I did some more changes. I replaced some programmed clarinet, bassoon, and stuff with real bassoons, clarinets, violins, upright bass, and some other instruments replaced by real musicians who came to my studio. I wanted to give that extra push to everything. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;In one way, it’s the best work I’ve done in my life, I think.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s quite different from what Mats and I do regularly or my own stuff. When I composed for this, I had to think about the fact that it’s an orchestra that will perform it. It’s a bit different because the sound from an orchestra is fantastic. Even when they tune, you have this incredible sound. Then there are some limits rhythmically speaking. You don’t want to do anything too complicated, rhythmically speaking. That’s one thing to think about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I added my strings in Pro Tools and then I started to fool around with clarinet. Simple sounds, like standard clarinet sounds, and then the music came out. I didn’t really know that I would be able to end up with material because this is not the typical way for me to compose. I think it’s one of the best things I’ve ever done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: That’s great! &lt;em&gt;Through the Eyes of a Morgchestra&lt;/em&gt; is available now through BandCamp and through your website, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ad&quot;&gt;You should purchase &lt;a href=&quot;https://morganagren.bandcamp.com/album/through-the-eyes-of-a-morgchestra&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Through the Eyes of a Morgchestra&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; via BandCamp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MA: Yeah, there are hard copies to get through my home page and I have a box ready for Steven at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cuneiformrecords.com&quot;&gt;Cuneiform Records &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He will sell them and make them available through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.waysidemusic.com&quot;&gt;Wayside Music &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And sometime in late January, it’s going to be out on all the iTunes, Spotify, and stuff. I also gave up the good and bad thoughts about streaming. Finally I just–well, never mind. I’m going to put everything there, finally. I don’t know if that’s good or not. It’s probably good beacuse people are going to be able to hear it and people don’t buy that many CDs, but some still are. This is a separate discussion for, like, a 2 hour discussion on streaming or not. I decided to use it. It’s going to be there in the end of January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Excellent. And then you have a second release, the &lt;em&gt;35th Anniversary Collection&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ljqNLREnXnM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MA: Yeah, this is the anniversary collection [holds up the CD]. This was very natural for me to put together because I realized last year that next year is going to be 35 years that me and Mats have played together. Then we wanted to plan some cool things to do because of that fact that we’ve been playing together for 35 years. So, we had only a couple weeks ago, we had two concerts in Stockholm in this old, super-nice theater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Usually, we used to play at the local jazz club called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fasching.se&quot;&gt;Fasching &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We played there for 25 years and it’s easy and it works. I would just call them and then we’d play. You know, 330 people maximum, so usually we’d set up and play and it’s super nice. But this time, having an anniversary, we wanted to have a little more like a celebration edge to it. So, I got in contact with this theater and we had two dates there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Then I started to try to put together a “best of” collection. That took quite some time, actually, because it was not easy. There is quite a lot to choose from and you have to use this “kill your darlings” thing. There’s stuff you maybe want to have, but it’s only 77 minutes per disc. It’s a double CD, but it was still really hard to pick. After finding which songs to use and after putting them in a nice order, it’s like a new album. Track number 1 fits well with track 2 and there might be 10 years between them as to when we recorded them. Now I think it’s like a new album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I spent time with a really expensive guy doing remastering. He got me a really nice deal and I think that now it’s a 6-page digipak and a 60-page booklet. Super good and remastered. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I would say that this is the only Mats/Morgan album you need.&lt;/span&gt; If you want only one album, this will be pretty much everything you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ad&quot;&gt;You should also purchase &lt;a href=&quot;https://morganagren.bandcamp.com/album/35th-anniversary-collection-2cd-25-hours&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mats/Morgan 35th Anniversary Collection&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; via BandCamp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/wLmtuhaCc2c?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: That’s really, really cool. When does that come out?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MA: The physical copies are all ready. They’re available on my homepage. I’m going to send Steven at Wayside some copies, too. That one is also going to be available on iTunes and Spotify and stuff in January. I should also take the opportunity to thank Steven at Cuneiform because all the releases have 5-year contracts and a bunch of the tracks that I really wanted to have on this collection–I printed both of these myself, so I needed to ask him permission to use different songs on the album. He was fine with that, so I’m happy because of that. Now it’s really good, I think, and it has some nice pictures inside. I had to go through a lot of hard disks to find photos and stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: That’s excellent. How was the Morgchestra show? We talked last time and it was shortly before the shows, so we wanted to wait and talk again. So, how did it go?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MA: I was very happy. It’s a mixed feeling because when I came to the rehearsal hall the first day, I heard the orchestra rehearsing my music even before I got to the stage. I was leaving my bags and stuff behind the stage and while doing that I heard &lt;em&gt;my chords&lt;/em&gt; played &lt;em&gt;by them&lt;/em&gt; and that’s a really unreal feeling. It’s huge and it’s fantastic and all that. At the same time, it’s scary because you want this to be–it &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be good. I would prefer it to be perfect, but it &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be good enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Somebody decided that we were going to get this request, it costs money, there are lots of people involved and it’s a big thing. Very few people get this kind of request at all, so it’s not something that you take lightly. It has to be good. Even a year before when I started to compose it, I thought, “This &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; to be good.” Everything has to be good in order for it to be worth it for the people who asked us and in order for us to feel that we can do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;There are limits, rhythmically and there’s a rock band with an orchestra, so it can be loud and all these possible problems that can happen. But, I think I would definitely say that the orchestra in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umeå&quot;&gt;Umea &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.norrlandsoperan.se/sve&quot;&gt;Norrlandsoperan &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a very good orchestra. The conductor told me that he works with tons of orchestras and this is one of the top 3 that he’s worked with. The median age is quite young. So, the typical 60-year-old Mozart-only guy won’t want to do anything other than Mozart wasn’t there. There were maybe a few, I don’t know, but it was a very positive vibe with happy faces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;The volume wasn’t as big an issue as a month before when we were in Germany. Mats and I went to Germany to do a separate project with the orchestra in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig&quot;&gt;Leipzig &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That was different because then you can feel that as soon as they saw the little Marshall combo and the drums, it was like they put their fingers in their ears. But, this was really good here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/IqvWwwUxz5U?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But then there is three short rehearsals and there’s always very few hours to rehearse and there’s tons of music. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Also one thing that I noticed was that I know this music in my sleep because I spent so much time with it. But, when we started to rehearse, everything sounded different.&lt;/span&gt; My own computer versions I know, but the real thing with all those sounds that were supposed to give me cues to the next part weren’t there any longer. So, suddently I was feeling unsure where we were in certain parts of the songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;The timing is different and there is always the conductor “thing.” You have a conductor and there’s always a delay with “one.” [Conducts in the air.] The delay is incredible sometimes. The orchestra is used to that. They just play. For me, I played exactly on the one, but the orchestra played with a delay. There is a balance. You might have some patterns you’re supposed to play with a tuba guy fifty feet away and you can’t hear each other really. All those kinds of things. It was better than I dared to hope for, I think. It was really good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: That’s excellent. So, for anyone who is just getting exposed to that, the Morgchestra CD is a recording of you and musicians in your studio and your computer. But, the show was a live representation of that music and more, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MA: Yeah, it’s the same exact compositions in form and themes and everything, but performed by a full-sized symphony orchestra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: And I imagine you recorded it and, hopefully, will release it at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MA: Yeah, that was another thing. When I decided to release the pre-production, I thought, “It doesn’t really matter if we end up having a good recording of the live thing. We can release that later because it’s going to be different with a full orchestra.” So, yeah, I did record it. That also required some telephone calls because this was performed during the jazz festival in Umea and Swedish radio was there to record most of the stuff that happened during the festival. Then there is always this big radio bus outside the festival house that records everything and there’s no way they’d give you a hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you know some people, though, you can always try to have a split cable and record your own audio files on your own hard drive. Then there is a different situation. But, yeah, so I have 64 tracks and I have everything on video. At this moment, I don’t dare to listen to it because I want to keep the memory alive. I worked so much the last couple of months I don’t have the energy to even go into it yet. But, I will open it up next year, for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: That’s excellent. Man, congratulations Morgan. That’s really fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MA: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tomtrapp.net&quot;&gt;Tom Trapp &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was a super nice conductor who also was the arranger. We did another project this year with this symphony orchestra. It was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Duke&quot;&gt;George Duke &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tribute. So, same symphony orchestra and then a big band, me and some other guys. &lt;a href=&quot;http://byronmillerpsychobass.com/&quot;&gt;Byron Miller &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on bass (George Duke’s old bass player), me and Mats and some other guys. Then for this George Duke project, it was also the same conductor and we liked him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;After the first coffee break at the first rehearsal, I said to Mats, “This guy is easy to follow.” He plays guitar also. He goes down to his rehearsal space and puts the Marshall amp on 10 and he plays. Not every conductor does that, you know? He has a little bit of both sides, both worlds. So it was a great decision to involve him on this, I think. He did stuff with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropole_Orkest&quot;&gt;Metropole Orkest &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Holland. He did some stuff with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Belew&quot;&gt;Adrian Belew &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/interview/steve-vai&quot;&gt;Steve Vai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/interview/mike-keneally&quot;&gt;Mike Keneally&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Rundgren&quot;&gt;Todd Rundgren &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tomtrapp.net/for-others/by-artist-name/&quot;&gt;people like that &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And George Duke, by the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Oh, that’s cool. Did you capture the 35th Anniversary shows?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MA: Same thing. Yes, I did. So, there were a couple of cameras and 36 channels recorded. Same thing there. I’m going to open that up sometime early next year. It was great, because the 35th anniversary concerts were so nice. In the 1990s we were a quintet, so we had a different bass player, keyboard player, and guitar player than now. We haven’t played together in quite some time, but I called them up and asked them if they wanted to join for this anniversary thing. They did!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, the quartet that started about 3 years ago kicked off the show and we played for an hour and a half or something, then the keyboard player and bass player left the stage and then I brought in the three other guys from the quintet. We played some old stuff, like three or four songs and then at the end, all of us played together. Then we had another guest that no one in the US knows, I think, but he’s a famous stand-up comedian, super super weird guy, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Wahlbeck&quot;&gt;Peter Wahlbeck &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He did a couple of projects that Music Für Alle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/AR-qgWgrB_M?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: What does that mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MA: “Music for everyone” in German, I think. He did some cool things, super underground. We performed two songs with him at the end. All seven of us plus him and again, this really nice theater. People came from a long way. I had people from France and Germany that came to see us. My first teacher from school, who is now 92 years old, she was in the audience. She came there in a wheelchair. Parents from people in the band, my parents. It was a really, really nice thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: That’s excellent. Cool! Well, thank you so much for your time and for the update. I really appreciate it. I think there’s some really cool information here. I’ll make sure to get the links and stuff and your promo stuff out on Make Weird Music. Cool, thank you Morgan!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;MA: Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;
