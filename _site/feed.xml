        <title>Steve Vai</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;thanks-to-our-sponsors&quot;&gt;Thanks To Our Sponsors!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://softwareplusplus.com&quot;&gt;Cory Berg at Software++&lt;/a&gt; and to &lt;a href=&quot;http://carlkingdom.com&quot;&gt;Carl King Creative&lt;/a&gt; for sponsoring this interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cory is a software development and management expert who’s written a fantastic book called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Software-Must-Have-Skills-Engineers-ebook/dp/B00U4ZRQC6&quot;&gt;Software++: Must-Have Skills for Engineers&lt;/a&gt;. There are a lot of software people I’ve met via Make Weird Music and Guitar Circle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carl is an expert filmmaker, author, and &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/carl-king&quot;&gt;former musician&lt;/a&gt;. His book, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Youre-Creative-Genius-Now-What/dp/1932907920&quot;&gt;So, You’re a Creative Genius… Now What?&lt;/a&gt;, has been a huge inspiration for me and many others. He filmed this interview and provided lots of great equipment and expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-little-about-steve-vai&quot;&gt;A Little About Steve Vai&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve Vai is a forward-thinking, virtuosic guitarist based in Los Angeles. He started his career in music with &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/frank-zappa&quot;&gt;Frank Zappa&lt;/a&gt; in 1979.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-so-weird&quot;&gt;What’s So Weird?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of Steve’s work makes use of the following weird music techniques:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Time Signatures&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Composition&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Virtuosity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-i-care&quot;&gt;Why I Care&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1996, I heard an instrumental guitar song on the radio (!!) that had the most incredible guitar playing I’d ever heard. It opened my eyes to new potential on the instrument and I had no idea that level of technicality, virtuosity, and musicality. The DJ said, “That was Steve Vai with his track &lt;em&gt;Juice&lt;/em&gt; off his new album, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_Love_Secrets&quot;&gt;Alien Love Secrets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.” Immediately, I scrounged up all the cash and change I could, went to Best Buy (when they actually had a good selection of music for sale), and bought it for $9.99.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little did I know, Steve Vai was–and still is–one of the most innovative, inspired, and ambitious guitarists in the industry. &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/frank-zappa&quot;&gt;Frank Zappa&lt;/a&gt; credited him with “impossible guitar parts” as the “stunt guitarist” of his band between 1980 and 1982. Between solo releases, he played with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcatrazz&quot;&gt;Alcatrazz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lydon&quot;&gt;John Lydon/Johnny Rotten&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Image_Ltd&quot;&gt;Public Image Ltd.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lee_Roth&quot;&gt;David Lee Roth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Cooper&quot;&gt;Alice Cooper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitesnake&quot;&gt;Whitesnake&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozzy_Osbourne&quot;&gt;Ozzy Osbourne&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His solo releases through the 1990s were mind-blowing. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passion_and_Warfare&quot;&gt;Passion and Warfare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Alien Love Secrets&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Garden&quot;&gt;Fire Garden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; were in my CD player for months. I bought every used guitar magazine and tablature book I could find to learn those songs. There are enough weird music techniques in these albums for decades of worthwhile study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through Steve’s music (especially sheet music), I learned an incredible amount about time signatures, composition, instrumentation, key modulations, humor, crossing multiple genres, experimentation, and virtuosity. He’s been a huge inspiration to my own guitar and composition techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve Vai has had a long, incredible history of trailblazing in the instrumental rock genre and he shows no sign of stopping. Every album features intricately planned and executed melodic explorations, rapid-fire blues-based riffage, and new sounds like you’ve never heard out of a guitar. His discography covers all sorts of ground from straightforward blues/rock to completely whacked-out alien noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-you-should-hear-first&quot;&gt;What You Should Hear First&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve never listened to Steve, here’s where to start:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For groundbreaking guitar rock: &lt;em&gt;Passion and Warfare&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For completely weird, Zappa-esque outlandishness: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flex-Able&quot;&gt;Flex-Able&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For compositional complexity: &lt;em&gt;Fire Garden&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for an album with one genre/version of Steve, you’re not going to find it. He sticks to no particular genre and offers something for everyone. My favorite pieces of his are the extended-length exploratory pieces, like &lt;em&gt;Freak Show Excess&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fire Garden Suite&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Story of Light&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Lucky Charms&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you’re looking for something REALLY out there, check out his performance of &lt;em&gt;Fire Strings&lt;/em&gt; with the Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bruford</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;who-is-bruford&quot;&gt;Who is Bruford?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bruford was a short-lived quasi-jazz-progressive rock band featuring incredible musicianship, innovative compositions, and some of my favorite songs ever. They released three albums of original compositions, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feels_Good_to_Me&quot;&gt;Feels Good to Me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_of_a_Kind_(Bruford_album)&quot;&gt;One of a Kind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradually_Going_Tornado&quot;&gt;Gradually Going Tornado&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, along with a couple of live albums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The band was led Bill Bruford (who you might know from Yes and &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/king-crimson&quot;&gt;King Crimson&lt;/a&gt;) and featured &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Berlin&quot;&gt;Jeff Berlin&lt;/a&gt; on bass, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Stewart_(keyboardist)&quot;&gt;Dave Stewart&lt;/a&gt; on keyboards, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Holdsworth&quot;&gt;Allan Holdsworth&lt;/a&gt; on guitar, who was later replaced by “The Unknown John Clark.” Bruford’s extremely complex music is made to sound effortless by these virtuosic performers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of a Kind&lt;/em&gt; is a groundbreaking instrumental album and my favorite of all their releases. Each song is memorable and has something great to offer. It opens with the track &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/learn/hells-bells&quot;&gt;Hell’s Bells&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which I dissected in another video. That song is followed by &lt;em&gt;One of a Kind&lt;/em&gt;, a two-part song that is very near and dear to my heart. The song &lt;em&gt;5G&lt;/em&gt; is so good it’ll make you want to stop playing music. Honestly, every track on the album is great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gradually Going Tornado&lt;/em&gt; features Jeff Berlin on vocals, making a… Uh, best effort. Despite the vocal performance, the songwriting is awesome on this album. &lt;em&gt;Age of Information&lt;/em&gt; is a great rock song, but the song &lt;em&gt;Joe Frazier&lt;/em&gt; is probably the highlight of this album. It’s an instrumental track that explores some cool, fun territory and Bill Bruford lays a great foundation to let the other band members shine, particularly Jeff Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Feels Good to Me&lt;/em&gt; showcases &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annette_Peacock&quot;&gt;Annette Peacock&lt;/a&gt; on vocals, which may be a bit of an acquired taste for some. Either way, this album was innovative in how it paved the way for dry-mixed, up-front female vocalists, particularly in the avant garde genre. There’s a lot of great instrumental content on the album, including some songs that remained in Bill Bruford’s repertoire for the remainder of his professional career, like &lt;em&gt;Beelzebub&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the weird techniques employed by this band are: odd time signatures and polyrhythms, genre mixing, virtuosic performance, key modulations, extended improvisation, and more. There’s a ton you can learn from listening to Bruford and even more if you put some effort into learning the material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its short-lived existence, this band made a lasting impact on musicians all over the world. Musicians all over the world are posting YouTube covers and transcriptions of several songs. I plan on publishing some more content in the future covering some more notable Bruford moments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, give a listen to each of their releases and see what inspires you to create something new and different.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Harnch by Anthony Garone</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-a-harnch&quot;&gt;What is a “Harnch”?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Harnch&lt;/em&gt; is the name of a guitar instrumental jazz fusion song by me, Anthony Garone, owner and proprietor of this very website. The performance being shared in this post is an acoustic guitar quartet arrangement I performed in Robert Fripp’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_standard_tuning&quot;&gt;New Standard Tuning&lt;/a&gt; [NST].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The song gets its name from the crazy section at the end with all the time signatures. It’s the only non-swear word I could think of while recording it that adequately expressed how difficult it was to perform and record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;music-video&quot;&gt;Music Video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a video with some “fun fact” overlays, including all the time signature changes. Playing this piece in NST offered a new challenge that was accommodated by the tempo decrease from the original performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKxuR7x4JrE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;original-recording&quot;&gt;Original Recording&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original song was performed a bit faster in standard tuning on electric guitars. I played all the instruments except for the piano, which was sequenced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/qQp9uzCcFug?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sheet-music&quot;&gt;Sheet Music&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in the sheet music for this song, I have it for guitar quintet in normal standard tuning (what Fripp calls “original standard tuning”) and for guitar quartet in Fripp’s “New Standard Tuning” (CGDAEg, low to high).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MakeWeirdMusic/assets/tree/master/anthony-garone/harnch/ost&quot;&gt;Standard Tuning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MakeWeirdMusic/assets/tree/master/anthony-garone/harnch/ost&quot;&gt;New Standard Tuning&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MakeWeirdMusic/assets/tree/master/anthony-garone/harnch/ost/midi&quot;&gt;MIDI&lt;/a&gt; (includes &lt;a href=&quot;http://musescore.org&quot;&gt;MuseScore&lt;/a&gt; file)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch out for the coda! &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.garone.org/guitar/harnch-for-five-guitars&quot;&gt;Here’s some additional context on my old website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hell&#39;s Bells by Bruford</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-we-learning&quot;&gt;What are we learning?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s pick apart the catchy hook from the song &lt;em&gt;Hell’s Bells&lt;/em&gt; off the 1979 release &lt;em&gt;One of a Kind&lt;/em&gt; by the fusion/rock band, &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/bruford&quot;&gt;Bruford&lt;/a&gt;. (NOTE: It is not a cover of the AC/DC song with the same name… I think?) It features Allan Holdsworth on guitar, Jeff Berlin on bass, Dave Stewart on keyboards, and Bill Bruford on drums. The song’s intro alone contains odd &lt;a href=&quot;/techniques/time-signatures&quot;&gt;time signatures&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/techniques/key-modulations&quot;&gt;key modulations&lt;/a&gt; that make it weird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;instructional-video&quot;&gt;Instructional Video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve put together an instructional video that illustrates everything in the charts below. Watch that if, like me, you don’t like reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/wNCSTNHejAY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;time-signatures&quot;&gt;Time Signatures&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time signatures in this song are ridiculous. It took me a long time to figure the signatures out, then it took me even longer to believe they were correct!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rawgit.com/MakeWeirdMusic/art/master/bill-bruford/hells-bells/hells-bells-slide-time-signatures-section-A-1067x600.png&quot; alt=&quot;A section: 19/8 = 7/8 + 7/8 + 5/8&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this means is each phrase is 19 beats (eighth notes/quavers) composed of a bar of 7, a bar of 7, and a bar of 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rawgit.com/MakeWeirdMusic/art/master/bill-bruford/hells-bells/hells-bells-slide-time-signatures-section-B-1067x600.png&quot; alt=&quot;B section: 19/8 = 4/8 + 4/8 + 4/8 + 4/8 + 3/8&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section starts with the Gb chord (fingers in the section below) and ends with the Am7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rawgit.com/MakeWeirdMusic/art/master/bill-bruford/hells-bells/hells-bells-slide-time-signatures-section-C-1067x600.png&quot; alt=&quot;C section: 19/8 ¿ 11.3/9 ≥ 17/3 ? (It&#39;s a joke)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just kidding on that last one…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/wNCSTNHejAY&quot;&gt;watching the video&lt;/a&gt; above to make sure you hear me play through each section and you can count it out yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chords&quot;&gt;Chords&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this song makes use of odd &lt;a href=&quot;http://makeweirdmusic.com/techniques/time-signatures&quot;&gt;time signatures&lt;/a&gt;, but what may not be obvious by glancing at the chords is that it also employs regular &lt;a href=&quot;http://makeweirdmusic.com/techniques/key-modulations&quot;&gt;key modulations&lt;/a&gt;. What I find most interesting about the key modulations is the keys change between Bb major and E major, two notes that form &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tritone&quot;&gt;a “tritone” interval relationship&lt;/a&gt; that sound pretty ugly when played together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the chords and fingerings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;tab&quot;&gt;      BbM7add2   Bb2      Gb      Fm7    Cadd2/E     C        Am7
  e   -10----   ----   -------   -----   ------   ------   --------
T B   ----10-   -11-   -------   ---6-   --8---   ----8-   -10p8---
A G   -10-10-   -10-   -----6-   -8---   ----7-   --9---   ------9-
B D   -10-10-   -10-   -6h8---   -6---   -10---   -10---   -10-----
  A   -13-13-   -13-   -9-----   -8---   --7---   -10---   --0-----
  E   -------   ----   -------   -----   ------   --8---   --------
         E2         Gb2
      -7-----   --9-------
      ---7-9-   -----9-11-
      -9-9-9-   -11-11-11-
      -9-9-9-   -11-11-11-
      -7-7-7-   --9--9--9-
      -0-0-0-   ----------
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;this-stuff-aint-easy-folks&quot;&gt;This Stuff Ain’t Easy, Folks!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several brave souls who’ve recorded covers of “Hell’s Bells” on youtube, often of varying quality. The song is quite complex and was proven to be a challenge even for Mike Portnoy, Billy Sheehan, Derek Sherinian, and Tony MacAlpine! (Skip to 1:50 to check it out)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/QmCJRciBZRQ?t=1m47s?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should you find yourself learning this song, let me know! I’d love to hear it!!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Dale Turner</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-context&quot;&gt;Some Context&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is an interview &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/carl-king&quot;&gt;Carl King&lt;/a&gt; and I did with Dale in September 2014. While it’s interesting enough to read-through, I highly recommend listening to the audio because Dale has a great sense of humor, provides lots of fun voices, and the interview is pretty dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a doubt, the last few minutes of the interview offer such wonderful insight for anyone looking to pick up techniques on making their music more interesting (or, as we say here, “weird”). Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interview-video&quot;&gt;Interview Video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/tvt2GFQGb3E&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interview-transcript&quot;&gt;Interview Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;Anthony: This is Anthony from MakeWeirdMusic.com. I am here with Dale Turner, multi-instrumentalist, instructor at Musician’s Institute in the guitar program, and all-around pretty decent-looking guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Dale: &lt;strong&gt;Insane voice&lt;/strong&gt; Well, first of all I must say that I am deeply offended because I am assuming by your very presence in this room, you’re implying that I make weird music. That hurts me deeply. Give me a break. &lt;strong&gt;End insane voice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lots of laughter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: Sorry about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Why would that be the first thing you say?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: Can we get some more chair in this mix?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;Carl: It’s a good start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Many thanks to Carl King Creative for the gear to do this, and for engineering and being an all-around decent-looking guy. All right, we’ve started this thing off with a bang. Dale!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: Anthony!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: What’s your story? How did you get started with music?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: My parents always had tunes in the house, but I know what got me motivated to try to be an instrument-playing person. Two people named David when I was a kid: 1. My uncle David, and 2. Another David.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laughter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: What the hell happened?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: They can’t both be your uncle! You’re like, “1. My uncle David, the second is another guy named David.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: I have, like, a shitload of Uncle Davids. I’m totally serious. I got so many fucking Uncle Davids and Uncle Bobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Okay, so, two guys named David… No one’s going to find this funny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: Two guys named David are sitting in a church…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Okay, so what got you started in music?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: Well, I know what started me wanting to play stuff was, uh… Now I can’t even say David without fucking myself up. I don’t even know what was so funny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;A: It’s not the name, it’s just two guys named David. So, two guys named David…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: This is Anthony from MakeWeirdMusic.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: Just keep it rolling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yeah, so how did you get started with making music?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: My Uncle David… [laughter]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laughter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: Maybe you should just skip that part. Come back to it later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So your parents had instruments or something?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: No! All right, so my Uncle David…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laughter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: You can do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: All right, I’ll do this. But, since I already said Uncle David.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I’m not going to laugh this time. It’s this guy &lt;strong&gt;Pointing to Carl&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: So because I already said his name, I’m gonna not say it. Uncle David was in a cover band in downtown Seattle and I remember getting in to see him at a bar—I think it was 1st grade or younger—And he was playing drums and singing and when I heard him actually play and sing a Beach Boys song, a song that I actually knew already, and seeing an actual person I knew being the performer, it kind of freaked me out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And at the same time, another fellow named David was a piano playing bad-ass. I used to always go over for family gatherings over to their pad and I saw him ripping through Flight of the Bumble Bee, but a boogie-woogie version of it. So that motivated me to ask, “Can I have piano lessons?” So I got piano lessons and that got me to mucking around with the music thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So, was piano your first instrument? Sounds like at a pretty early age. 6 or 7?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: Yeah, I think that was in first grade when I started piano and I bashed on that all the way until 7th grade. 5th grade I started trumpet, played that all the way throughout the end of high school. Then picked up piano again—well, picked it up… you know what I mean. Started bashing on it. “I was really ripped by the time I was in 12th grade, so I picked up piano.” Anyway, and got back into that. Guitar started happening when I was 15 and that sorta took over because it’s sorta hard to rock on the piano. I mean, you could somewhat with the synthesizer/keyboard thing. Trumpet was sort of the opposite of rocking. Plus I got braces, which sort of trashed my trumpet chops. So I just went gung-ho on guitar and that was that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Was the guitar an instrument for you to compose or to perform? What were you doing on the guitar at that age?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: The first year on guitar, I did take lessons for that very first year and I started learning chords and some scale type of stuff. But, after that first year, I quit and just started making up riffs. I always made up unaccompanied solos because I sort of worshipped those guitar beasts playing their 2-minute Eruption-type things. I hilariously still have a million of those on tape. Every month or so, I would make my own little Eruption. And that’s kinda all I did for a while on guitar. Then started figuring out solos and songs of other people and started jamming along. Then started playing with a drummer friend of mine, Dean, and we started writing some rock songs and that was kind of the first time I interacted on the guitar with another person and that brought it to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: When did you start making music? Recording it? Composing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: I think the first song—well, I had this cheap acoustic guitar that I did make up goofy little songs on and I had a cassette recorder. I think I had two cassette recorders and I would play one part into the cassette recorder and come up with another layer of it and somehow I would come up with a 2-track thing of this little cheapo acoustic guitar. And I had a few songs like that, I remember, and they were all named after different girls, of course. One of them was the Monica song, but we don’t have to go there. I think my first real—I guess they were real to me—I did write a song on the piano that was sort of a dirge-y thing. I think I was probably a late bloomer. I have no idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;As far as the songwriting thing, I just wanted to get good at an instrument, but I was still trying to be creative on it as well at the same time. Trying to do my own arrangements of other songs in live bands or adapting keyboard parts on guitar. So I was always trying to do something a little extra, I guess. At some point I moved down to Los Angeles—Oh, I totally spaced out. I was in a few rock bands in the Seattle area, but it was mostly me contributing electric guitar parts to another guy’s songs just trying to beef them up. Maybe I learned a little bit about metal through that experience, which is kind of what I was raised on anyway. Dio, Maiden, Queensryche—that kind of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So, those were some influences for you? You were playing in Seattle and you ended up in LA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: Yeah and I did the music school thing, which was fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Where did you go?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: USC, actually, for four years. Totally bitchin’. I initially had my sights set on trying to be a studio guitar type person or side person touring goofball, but at some point I got way into wanting to be Pat Metheny. Kind of, something like that, which obviously didn’t happen. But I really went into the instrumental—I don’t want to say fusion, but it was jazz-influenced tasteful tunes. The songs themselves were great—Metheny’s songs were amazing, plus the playing—And that was always an inspiration to try to meld the two. I didn’t get into vocal songs until quite a while, other than joke kind of songs, but nothing serious until way down the road. Over time, I tried to integrate my interest in yodeling/singing and diversity guitar approaches and Iron Maiden-influenced songs. Can’t escape the Maiden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: How many official releases do you have? Have you played with bands and released albums? Or have you only done solo work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: It’s not too much stuff. I did one acoustic guitar quartet CD that I’m on that was really fun. I was in David Pritchard’s acoustic guitar quartet for maybe 5 or 7 years and we played live a lot and I did get to do one recording, which is actually on a Warner Brothers subsidiary, which is kinda neato. And then a bunch of CDs that just went with instructional books that I started to get involved in. That was a whole other goal: instructional books with audio. So, did a lot of that kind of recording, which was cool because it forced me to learn how to record. And that, coming from a backwards angle, was partly what got me more interested in another type of songwriting, I guess. I was already writing for instructional books, and I forget if I was already writing for magazines by that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;When I got a hold of an actual recording system that enabled me to layer parts, that actually got me way more motivated to compose and flesh out ideas. Prior to that, it was always boom box land, which is still songwriting because a song doesn’t have to be a billion tracks to be a song.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: But, the constraints are very different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: I guess it just made it a little more exciting to hear something that sounded less crappy. Now, I have a whole stupid thing in my head that is important to me: The difference between songwriting and production. So many people get enamored by the stylization and the production elements of a song versus spending a crazy amount of time on just the craft of songwriting and they neglect the real nuts and bolts of songwriting that really makes a song be a song versus just all the textural ear candy stuff that you hear that makes something sound interesting, but when you boil it down and strip away the stylization, the song might not be as much… You know what I’m saying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: The second album by Seal with Trevor Horn’s production. I just remember thinking, “This album is incredible!” Then I started learning the songs and I was like, “Wow, these songs are so simple, but he turned them into incredible works of art,” but behind it is just a normal song.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: Yeah, that’s the kind of thing I started to notice a lot. I was telling Carl this. When I was transcribing for Guitar World for a billion years, part of the gig is to write out songs that are flavor of the month, chart-topping tunes, from doing that over and over—I was already doing full-album stuff, but this is the specific singles-type market transcription thing—And I started to notice in a ton of well-known, “modern” songs that if you just remove the percussive aspects—you know, the drum track or whatever was driving the groove—it was like, freakin’ bare bones, minimal two-chord stuff, which started to actually really, really bother me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So I tried to really not be dependent upon the ear candy stuff and I just tried to develop in areas that make a song—at least in whatever level I’m able to achieve—somewhat interesting instead of just the two- or three-chord thing, which is super-cool, but now I can’t even write a song that’s just two- or three-chord because I’m… all fucked up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: How did you end up with those professional gigs. You ended up getting published in magazines that are sold all over the country, you’re writing transcription books, doing lessons and writing songs in the style of… How did you end up with a gig like that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: That was a trip. It was actually pretty crazily calculated. I didn’t know how it was going to unfold, but I had very specific goals way before I was interested in songwriting. Going way back in time, I knew I didn’t suck at transcribing and I also really liked it and I always was impressed by being a fan of guitar magazines for lots of years, “Oh wow, how did these guys learn how to write this stuff out?” You know, all that kind of stuff. So I wanted to learn how to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;That’s one of the many things that sent me down the path to get musically literate to the point where I could write stuff out, which doesn’t make anybody a good musician, it’s just a technical thing. But I was way interested in that for whatever reason and at some point I really tried to get a job doing that and that took a while for that to materialize. Then once that materialized, at some point one of the companies that I worked for thought I wasn’t a complete idiot and they—because most people agree that I’m some sort of idiot…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yeah, Carl’s shaking his head in agreement. And I’m also nodding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: Yeah, mega-idiot. Megidiot! And they asked me to audition and send in a few writing samples analyzing the music of Steve Morse, who also happens to be one of my all-time favorite writing musical beasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Incredible guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: Totally. So I wrote out a whole analysis of a bunch of his riffs and pieces and things and sent it in, and they were like, “Okay!” The first thing I got to write was a book in the style of Steve Morse, which is a jackpot blast for me. So I started doing a lot of that kind of stuff for this company, which ended up through another in-road hooking me up with a separate company which eventually gave birth to its own guitar magazine, which was Guitar One, and I was west coast editor of for 11 years until it got killed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But, prior to that, I randomly transcribed an Albert Lee video and the guy that was interviewing Albert Lee in the video, Askold Buk, randomly remembered me years later when he was working at Guitar World, said, “Hey, that guy was sort of not-horrible at transcribing,” so then I got hooked into Guitar World that way. All that stuff kind of happened—I don’t want to say snowballed—But one thing definitely fed into the other and I definitely had a goal of transcribing, writing instructional books, instructional content and interviewing all my favorite musical heroes in guitar magazines, and each one of those things started to happen over time. And it was cool and I learned a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;C: Can I suggest a question? I have a question. This is Carl King speaking. I’m wondering why you wanted to do that instead of being a guitar god on stage in the limelight. Why were you attracted behind the scenes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: To nerd-dom? Actually I know exactly how to answer that! Initially when I did move down here, I had a very clear idea of what I wanted to do. And then that changed. But then I was interested in so many different things that I wasn’t 100% interested in one thing enough to devote myself entirely to one thing. So, I wasn’t really sure anymore what I truly wanted to do, but I knew I wanted to at least find a way to employ myself that I could also learn at the same time while I figured out what the hell I wanted to really do. And that’s really what made me bash on that—I really wanted to do that stuff anyway and in a way it was a little more than I wanted to play because—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;That’s actually not true because at the same time, I was in several bands while I was doing the transcribing stuff. I was still in that acoustic guitar quartet, I was in two different rock-oriented bands, I was in a blues and R&amp;amp;B cover band—a bunch of stuff. And I kind of liked all that, but it wasn’t enough for me to get 14 roommates and live in a small apartment and say, “Let’s just give it a whirl!” For whatever reason, that type of thing didn’t appeal to me by this point in time in my life. Not where I am now, but way back then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And another bizarre thing, at some point I had a ton of friends that were the type of guitar player who, “All I want to do is jam and play and jam and play!” all the freakin’ time. Part of me started to view the guitar playing music-making part—maybe this is after being in a bunch of bands that didn’t work out—I started making the guitar thing a more personal thing, so I didn’t go that other route because of that, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Did you consider yourself a full-time musician? Or did you consider yourself a writer? What would you have called your trade at that point?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: That is kind of a funny question because I still have a hard time saying, “Oh, I’m a musician.” You know what I mean? For two years, I had a full-time job that was kind of music-related, but it was an organization that booked classical and jazz and world music acts in venues throughout Los Angeles, including the Orpheum Theater, and other crazy theaters that were “historically or architecturally significant” (I used the do the marketing and crap for them). And then at some point, I started to teach guitar at night at USC. The first time I remember labeling myself, I think I was calling myself a guitar journalist, which is kind of weird, because I was writing a lot about guitar. Or maybe it was guitar transcriber/journalist. Transcribing a bunch of things, but also writing about and interviewing a bunch of my favorite peeps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: But you weren’t writing or producing your own music at that time, were you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: No, but I was still doing the other stuff, recording instructional CDs. It wasn’t like, “I made another album!” at all. Total late bloomer. Like I was yammering earlier. In a weird way, it’s possible that what got me motivated to get into the songwriting thing was a reaction against stuff I noticed that was driving me crazy, plus stuff that I really liked, plus a bunch of hand injuries that made it a bit trickier for me to deliver some guitar lickage. I was doing a Joe Satriani instructional CD and in the middle of it, fried my hand and got the carpal tunnel fun. So I couldn’t play for a while and getting back into playing, I wanted to feel like I was making music, so I got more into playing and singing at the same time, but really doing it in a technical way since I was always trying to get more technical on the guitar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;When my hand was destroyed I could really only play basic stuff, but the technical ability to sing and play complicated rhythmic relationships, I really tried to go deep into that partly because it was to keep the challenge and feel like I’m developing, but at the time I got really into Jeff Buckley, and all that stuff at the time started to present a little of a detour from the path I’d been on previously with the borderline wannabe guitar jock thing. I thought, “Okay, now I’m done soloing apparently. I’ll try to use the guitar for another purpose.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So what started your compositional era? What was the transition like from where you were then to starting to write and record your own music? And you retained all those jobs throughout, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: The cool thing about it—I don’t want to say “blessing”—but the fact that I was not deriving my livelihood from shredding did make it possible for me to keep going. So I’m still interviewing all sorts of favored guitar people from any playing style: Yngwie, Paul Gilbert, Buckethead, but then John Frusciante, Chris Cornell, tons of people. Way over 100 guys. So I was still surviving monetarily and in a way, getting inside of the heads of those world-renowned artist beasts, sort of did a little something internally, maybe. I don’t know. It was kind of motivational when I would interview these people who were not these shredding mutant beasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;John Frusciante in particular was a big inspiration because it was really obvious how he just stripped away everything from his life that didn’t relate to being in the most creative frame of mind possible at all times. He didn’t freakin’ drive a car at all. He was always as relaxed as possible, which I’m not, but it was interesting being around those kinds of people. Brian Wilson I got to interview a couple times, which was brutal for me. I think I’m getting off-target. At some point, I did start writing songs that were vocal-oriented a teeny bit before my hand imploded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I’m interested in getting the story from when you were just starting out to when you were…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: Tune-smithing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yeah, and particularly what I might call “unorthodox music” like on Mannerisms Magnified only in that it follows normal song structure, but there’s all sorts of interesting rhythmic stuff going on, there’s hardly a 1-4-5 moment on the CD. So in that respect, you’re making music that doesn’t just cater to normal people’s expectations, but it’s great music that’s very much “you,” but perhaps at the expense of “I’m not going to just make another formulaic song that you’ll hear on the radio and try to get a hit,” rather “I want to make music that’s meaningful, but people will like it to.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: Oh, thanks man. I would think by the time that recording came out, since I’m definitely not… totally young. I think with all the different jobs that I had prior to really starting to feel some drive and momentum and creative feeling connected with song making, at some point I tried to take the acoustic guitar and use it like a piano player would because I was always interested in solo guitar playing… arrangements of popular songs that weren’t just guitar. So, after my hand was trashed but I still was doing my regular work connected with the musical universe and the Buckley fandom that I mentioned earlier, I did start to learn a bunch of cover songs, but tried to tweak them in the way he always did. Not exactly like he did, but any performance you hear of Jeff Buckley doing a cover song, it was totally not him trying to cop the original. There was so much of the wealth of influences that he had throughout his musical life and his unbelievable improvisational ability all funneling into his performances that I really got inspired by that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, the first thing I did, but a huge number of songs that I always liked, I tried to work out ways to make them be cool to me on guitar and voice. At some point, I recorded a bunch of them, but just to give them to my mom for Christmas. This is way back, I think in 2000. That was just a live thing I recorded right here where we’re sitting and that was just me singing and playing at the same time. That was a thing I was trying to get into, the rhythmic independence and that whole challenge. Four years after I gave that to my mom, I’d given a bunch of copies to pals, and a couple of them were like, “Dude, you should maybe think of, like, I don’t know, put this out.” Because there’s a couple of goofy things on there. There’s a guitar/vocal only version of Bohemian Rhapsody that’s sort of funny, I think. There’s a pretty cool version of God Only Knows by the Beach Boys, just guitar and voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;In 2004, I finally put that out and that actually would be the first release that I put out myself and it’s called “Interpretations” because that’s basically what it is. And there’s liner notes where I tried to briefly describe all the little tweaks I tried to do: meter changes, feel changes, a bunch of songs that were piano and adapted on guitar. There’s even a version of “Hallelujah” that I did that was obviously inspired by Buckley, and I tried not to blatantly rip it off. That would be the first thing that I’d say, “Oh, I’m an artist now,” even though it’s not anything that I created, other than the arranging and personalizing I tried to do with those other songs that I loved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Was that released by yourself or did you have a distributor or something like that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: I did the full-on independent thing. I started Intimate Audio, which is my “label name” and that’s also my website, intimateaudio.com. I was also interested in music made 100% by the people themselves and so in listening to records like that, I felt more intimately connected with them as artists. That’s part of the motivation behind creating Intimate Audio, the site. Way back it used to be a forum. I had a little message board and I made a little radio station where people would upload their songs. This was before myspace. And I’d do reviews of their songs, stuff they recorded at home, played all the instruments themselves, that sort of stuff. I had a streaming radio station and it was pretty cool, but once myspace came out, it just made it kind of pointless. Plus, it was kind of a lot of work doing that stuff by hand, it was not automated at all. So anyway, Intimate Audio was kind of about that and I just went through CD Baby, iTunes, Amazon, etc. that anybody can do nowadays, which is pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Mannerisms Magnified was the next release?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: That’s right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: What was your motivation to make that album? To be the one playing everything. You did everything except manufacture the equipment you used to make it and to produce the album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: Yeah, that was a really stupid idea. No, I think that gets back to the whole Intimate Audio mission thing that I got into from being into records by Elliot Smith, Todd Rundgren, Jon Brion, Joseph Arthur, the first Paul McCartney solo album, even Phil Collins. Tons of records out there where one person did everything. Being impressed by that doesn’t necessarily mean the music is good, but I already was impressed by the music of some of these people Stevie Wonder, there’s some records where he almost played everything. Prince.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Lenny Kravitz…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: Exactly. And actually on my goofy website I have a whole section on the website called “Multi-Instrumentalists” and hilariously the first album on there is by Greg Wells, who I would have to (if I could) mention was a huge influence on me trying to go that whole multi-instrumentalist route. A million years ago I auditioned for Greg Wells’ band, that was at the time called Silas Loader, and I failed miserably. I didn’t get it. The tour never happened anyway, so I didn’t miss out. The crazy thing is that he was at the time k. d. lang’s drummer and he played every instrument on his record. It was on IRS records. He didn’t know at the time that the label was about to go bankrupt and the whole thing kind of imploded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;The record is awesome. I learned half of it in two days, which is super quick and is a bonus of me being a transcribing psychopath learning it in the car as I do my business. The other records that I mentioned weren’t necessarily “rock band” records. They were other styles, but this was an actual rock record where one guy played everything. That was kind of a “blueprint” of some form. Freakishly some years later, I started to notice co-writing credits of him showing up on Aerosmith records. Now he’s produced Katy Perry, wrote some stuff on the latest Adelle record… He’s a total freaking monster. He’s a real badass and he still is playing everything. Pretty inspiring guy. I don’t know him at all, he was really cool when I got to play with him in the attempt to get into that band. That’s part of what planted the seed for me trying to much around in that area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: At some point, you had to decide, “I’m going to write an entire album’s worth of material and I’m going to perform on every instrument on it, and mix it, engineer, do all of it.” Was there a deciding factor in that or did it organically happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: I should back up a little bit and throw this in there. Part of the reason this whole thing is a direction I’m still on in my new mix of tunes that I’m doing—I’m torturing myself in the same idiotic way—twelve or thirteen more songs, writing and playing everything… But I do know for sure having been in a bunch of bands, none of them were huge but everyone wanted them to be successful, and every single one of them imploding for one reason or another, or some kooky flavor of the month stylistic change… I just decided to stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;At some point I did actually know what I wanted after a million years and I just figured that I would try to do it myself because I was sick of the drama, I guess, and issues. That was another thing that made me try to be a self-contained thing. I didn’t realize at all how challenging and brutal it would be, especially in three key areas: the drums—which I did real acoustic drums—and the lyrics writing, and the mixing aspect. And even in the end for Mannerisms Magnified, I still had a guy bail me out with the mix big time. But, those three things were things I didn’t foresee as being a colossal time-suck. Also in the same way, way back when I said, “Why do I want to get a job transcribing and stuff like that?” part of the learning junkie in me did want to learn more about drums, learn about mixing, trying to wear all those different hats. It certainly wasn’t making me a worse musical person. And at some point I kind of would like to be—this is kind of a fantasy—but Jon Brion is one of my top four biggest musical inspirations possible. For a million years, I only had a list of three—there’s a billion on that list, but I only had three humongous ones—and I recently slapped him up there. Just an un-freaking-believable all-around force. He’s a film composer, singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, producer. I’ve seen his live show a million times at Largo, and even when Cafe Largo moved to the Coronet Theater, where he plays everything and totally does solo shows where he’s looping himself on a drum kit, making up songs on the spot, doing medleys… I’ve seen him do all of The Who’s Tommy all by himself…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So at some point, my motivation was to do it for my own musical projects, but I think I would enjoy augmenting other people’s tracks. I did that a few years ago with a fellow that used to record here. I played drums on his stuff and produced his record. That was the only full-band record that I produced here. But a bunch of other singer-songwriters would record guitar and vocal demo stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Cool! What is next for you, then? You say you’ve got 12 or 13 new songs you’re working on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: I did try to spend two years really promoting Mannerisms Magnified and I got a lot of good ink, good press, which is kinda cool. I played a little bit, but then I had a whole other hand issue develop, which resulted in me needing to have spine surgery, so that slowed me down a little bit, and then had two babies in the midst of that. But even during that I started to slap together some new tunes for another recording. I’ve got another one that’s brewing that’s probably going to be another thousand years. It’s 12 or 13 tunes. Some attributes would be similar to the previous thing where there’s some a cappella vocal things. Most of them stem from acoustic guitar, but I layered a bunch of electric instruments on them. This one’s way more electric guitar-heavy though. Some of the songs are weirder and a little more rock-oriented, I guess. I don’t really know how much more time that’s going to take. I can say that I’ve done all the… I should tell you because it’s silly. I usually record all the acoustic guitar for each song, then electric bass, and then electric guitars, then other ear candy for each song… I’ve pretty much done that for all the songs. I’ve gotta do the drums and then finish some lyrics so that I can do the yodeling and then, of course, mix. I have no idea how long that’s gonna take. Hopefully next year, but I have no clue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: That’s awesome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: Thank you, man. I can’t wait to throw them at you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I usually try to end with: You are a full-time musician. Would you recommend to others the path of somebody who strives to make real music that has unorthodox qualities (weird music)… What would be your advice to somebody who says, “I’ve just got this style and it’s my own and it’s not pop/rock. It’s not going to be on the radio most likely. How do I approach that? That’s what I want to do with my life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: Then start building it. Whatever it is that you do musically, whatever market you—I don’t even want to say the word “market” because it makes me hurl—but whatever you classify yourself in this day and age, it’s irresponsible to not have some foundational form of income that hopefully relates to the area that you want to have your brain swim in. So as long as you’ve got that handled and you are able to carve out free time… Some people have issues with procrastination and all that stuff, obviously you’ve got to fight through that. You’ve got to please yourself first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Any real song in the last billion years that people hear as being “revolutionary and amazing and game-changing and birth-of-style,” those people all are just doing what they wanted to do. They weren’t like, “Oh, if I mix a little bit of this song and I take the groove of this song and I pick this subject”—sometimes people will lyrically pick a subject that is accessible—but please yourself first. If you don’t have enough of a self to begin with, that’s a problem. I have a lot of songwriting students that I do catch trying to chase a trend, which the only time for me that’s cool is if you’re doing a work-for-hire thing where somebody needs you to write music “like this” or if you get yourself in a position where you’re writing video game music or film music, you’ve already got parameters set for yourself and that’s killer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I do regularly see a bunch of people changing their minds in the same way that I think “Chinese Democracy,” the Guns ‘n Roses album that took 15 freaking years, that’s the same type of wheel-spinning hell he must have been putting himself through. In the time when that record was started, there was industrial music, then Korn came out, there was a bunch of ska… violently different trends, end over end over end… I don’t know the first five years of Chinese Democracy sounded like, but I would bet that there was blatant genre-jumping—that’s dickish of me to say—that kind of thing you should just flush down the toilet if you already know what you want to do. If you don’t, as long as you’re chasing something then you’re going to grow and pieces of little things that you sample or tap into style-wise will become part of your musical makeup, and as get closer you won’t even know. Then all of a sudden you’ll look back and say, “Holy shit, I really actually do like specific stuff and I actually kind of do have a feel that I’m climbing toward, some kind of sound.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;If you’re in a position right now where you like a bunch of things and you’re not really sure which one is the greatest, that’s good. Just try to get really good at all those different things. At some point, you’re going to notice two different things: what you truly are the most cut-out to do that you’re naturally the best at, and what you actually love and not what you sort of like. Once you start getting closer to figuring that out, put all your eggs in that basket and try growing in those areas. And that’s when you’re going to hopefully start making some freaking weird music!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Cool! Thank you for all your time, perspective, context, all that. I appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: Thank you, man!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Ok, bye!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: We didn’t even talk about Vai!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Is he a big thing for you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: Oh yeah! I mean everyone has been. I was telling Carl I used to vandalize my school with his name and shit. All sorts of crap. In a way, that sort of got me interested in weirdness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: The Steve Vai stuff?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: Yeah, I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;C: I wanted to hear some of the specific ways. What elements are you making weird? What makes your melody weird? How do you feel about doing it? You say you’re into weird music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: Can I insert some things? Kind of foundation stuff. What kind of things that attribute to my affinity of weirdness?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: What are some things that you attribute to your affinity to weirdness?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: That’s a good question!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Thank you, I just made it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: Right on! Crazy thing… I was weaned on cartoons. I always loved Bugs Bunny cartoons. I didn’t really like any other cartoons. It was all the Warner Brothers stuff. A billion years later, I realized that Milt Franklin and Carl Stalling were the musical guys for that. I was always being pounded with that cartoon music. I always loved John Williams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: That’s what Carl said this morning. I interviewed him. John Williams got him going on music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: I wouldn’t say John Williams is weird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: No, but powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: Yeah. There’s a difference between the stereotypical film composer that’s got the classical foundation versus somebody like John Williams that’s a thematic freaking beast. It doesn’t sound like scales and arpeggios in some kind of chord sequence. It’s an obvious theme. And I know just from loving all those movies that got him there, Star Wars and a bunch of that music, is clearly influenced by Stravinsky. Way down the road I got way into Stravinsky. I also got way into Bartok. I got way into Chopin. So a lot of that started to get under my skin that would at some point influence me gravitating toward some kinds of sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Also way back when I was a kid, I used to listen to Spike Jones music who, if some people don’t know, he’s a 50s-era big band guy and a percussionist that hilariously was with Mel Blanc in a band called City Slickers. If you check out any of their recordings, it’s a bunch of goofballs just going off percussion instruments and weird voices. I know of that… This is single-digit age because my uncle DAVID and my dad had those records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And when I became a complete guitar spaz, I came across Steve Vai. Initially it was the movie Crossroads, but then I heard the first David Lee Roth album, which completely blew my mind, which made me get his Flexable record. When I heard that, I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I literally worshipped that guy for quite a while to the extent where I damaged some desks and bathroom stalls in his good name when I was in high school. I still love all that stuff. That left-of-center sound that I was always fascinated by, compounded by a ton of other stuff later, had to have some kind of influence in opening me up to sit in a position to chill out, listen, and absorb, and be moved by some heavier stuff, I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;C: Are there specific ways that you make your music weird instead of sounding normal or boring?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: &lt;strong&gt;Weird voice&lt;/strong&gt; Here’s a thing that I’ve started to talk quite a bit about with my songwriting students (I feel weird saying that, but I do have several freaking songwriting students)…&lt;strong&gt;End weird voice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: You are a teacher at a music school, so I would hope…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: Oh yeah, that’s right. I forgot about that. It does help. And truthfully, that’s another way… I teach music theory at a freaking music college, Musician’s Institute. My head is constantly swimming in stuff all the freaking time.  The more you mess with that stuff and have it in your head, the easier it is to analyze the stuff you hear that you stumble across and absorb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;A thing that I do encourage my songwriting students, a place I try to get them to, is what I did with myself and am always trying to improve, obviously: If you can take any number of your favorite songs and be able to describe in real actual terms what it is that you really love about the songs—and I don’t mean, “Oh the melody’s really nice,” which doesn’t explain anything—At some point I had several realizations in a row and none of these realizations were the reason I liked them. I didn’t read something in a magazine and go, “Oh this song has that, and so I like it.” These are songs that I’ve loved for years. Way after the fact, I started thinking, “Why is this song giving me goosebumps in this one spot?” Every time, it would be a non-diatonic chord in that one little spot. Some kind of sneak attack of a non-diatonic chord. Usually when somebody tries to analyze what’s happening, they’ll go, “Oh I really like the melody, kind of THERE.” What it is is the one melody note in relation to the surprise chord is the reason you’re getting an emotional reaction to it. Well, that means I have to get better at using non-diatonic chords in my stuff. But even before that, I realized that to me the key to having non-generic music has to come from the chord progressions, unless we’re talking about purely production stylization textural elements that make it interesting from sound design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: It makes me think of Chris Cornell’s album, “Euphoria Morning.” Every two to four beats, he’s changing a chord using diminished, half-diminished, tons of 7ths, and augmented chords… It’s very much like the Lennon/McCartney stuff. The whole flavor of chords instead of really simple stuff. “Flutter Girl,” every two beats, there’s a new chord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: And that was the one single from that album. Hilariously that you mention that, people always say, “Well, you’re just stuck in the past man.” Well, that album right now is inside the CD player of my car. I listen to that album all the freaking time still. I interviewed him for that album. I interviewed Alain Johannes and his band, Eleven, was the rhythm section for that album. I recently even hilariously did a little text back and forth with Allen through a Kickstarter thing because he’s releasing another solo album, and he’s a crazy musical genius guy that’s unheralded to some extent. Amazing guitar player. Plays a billion other stringed and woodwind instruments. Amazing songwriting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Anyway, there’s so many people out there to be inspired by, it’s ridiculous. So, an album like that would clearly be him and his guitar. And the production aspects, the ear candy, the layers of guitars, the treatment of the voice throughout, is what starts to stylize the songs. With that in mind, I try to use a crowbar separation between elements that contribute stylization and production versus just pure core musical things. That would be getting back to the whole “chords” thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;If you listen to “Nevermind,” the second Nirvana record, all those progressions are—the vast majority of them, the melodies are great—but part of the reason the melodies are great is that they have chords dropped underneath them that are just oozing with the curve ball thing. These are just two of several ingredients. You come to the realization that it’s not really the melody, but an interesting chord sequence that might inspire the melody, that’s one thing. So I decided to go down the path of creating more interesting chord progressions. A separate realization was the surprise insertion of non-diatonic chords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Another realization I started to notice a crazy amount of my favorite songs, every section was in a different key. The verse would be in this key, the pre-chorus would be in this key, and the chorus would be in another key, which generated a constant uptick in musical drama. So, “Okay, now I have to figure out how to get better at key changes.” Then I started to notice a lot of the songs that I like have a great flow to them. Then I started to realize, “Wow this song has seven measures in the verse. This one’s got a 9-bar thing.” All these asymmetrical elements. So I tried to make myself being open to not being super symmetrical. This one chord might be held an extra beat, so it’s a 5/4 bar that makes a little bit of a change-up to help stuff from being bloated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So all these little things I started to notice, including subtle use of odd meter, and I just tried to get better at all those kinds of things. Beyond those core musical things, there might be other things that I might consider being more production and stylization. I began to notice that, because I’ve worshipped the Beach Boys since I was 5. That’s all I freaking listened to for years, until Kiss! For example, every chorus to the most artistic Beach Boys songs, there are three different vocal parts. There’s a lead vocal, there’s a counter line, and there’s some kind of pad or rhythmic chanting vocal thing. And these are songs that I already loved and something about those appealed to me, so I tried to get a little bit of that in there. Even moreso, just the tracks to those more artsy Beach Boys songs, the instrumental interplay, the instrument line with the vocal, I was way attracted to that so I want to get better at that in my own stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I like weird background vocals, like King’s X with the cluster vocal harmonies. Way into Bobby McFerrin. Way into Mr. Bungle. All sorts of stuff where the influence there might be less structural, but might be a little bit more vocal stylization stuff that I just liked. The thing I try to work with my songwriting students is, if you can get a list going of songs you like and really, in a specific way, be able to describe and pinpoint the kinds of things you like, those areas are what you want to get better at. It can be 15 things. I have a list that’s at least that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;As you get better at each of those different categories, and it can be from a million different styles of music, the way all that stuff gets reassembled is going to be what your style is. Really. If it’s all stuff that you love and you’re getting better at all those individual areas that you love, then that has to be what’s going to make the end result of your tune-smithing. Does that kind of make sense?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yeah, I love that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: Don’t forget the whole other aspect: the instrumental—I really want to make sure people get the difference between that kind of stuff and the stylization production elements. There’s so many people who get trapped in the “I’m gonna use all these loops and drag all this crap in off my hard drive and program all this midi textural junk,” but when it still comes down to it, it’s still a basic chord progression—which doesn’t mean it’s bad, but if you are trying to get into heavier, more weird stuff, there’s ways to be weird without just involving sound design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Cool! Thanks again, Dale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;D: I forgot the other thing. This is an offshoot of the same thought of people getting enamored by sound design, which is bitchin’ because I would love to get into sound design to have technical elements, which truthfully is what I’m trying to have with my newer stuff. I’m trying to have interesting structural songs, but then try to go hopefully similarly weird with weird guitar sounds, weird ear candy, all that kind of business. Wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But, I see also people fall into the trap of, “Oh, I just tuned my strings to some weird stuff on my guitar and you know, it makes me write better.” And 9 times out of 10, those people that are the open-tuning mutants, still the same basic preschool chord changes. They just sound different because of the resonance of the open strings. It’s very rare, unless you start to really evolve in harmonic territory, to get beyond your influence of the same normal stuff, even if you’re tuning crazy. Rare exceptions would be Joni Mitchell. You listen to Joni Mitchell, billions of tunings, completely NOT run of the mill diatonic chord progression stuff. Very artistic and amazing. So, she’s got not only the interesting guitar sound, but is not restricted by influence. And Michael Hedges, open tunings but really not falling back to the same attraction of generic sounds that would result from being in standard tuning. He’s really always reaching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Anyway, I wanted to throw that in there because I see that all the time. It’s kind of a shame: denial. Doesn’t mean the songs aren’t good, it just means you’re really not doing what you wouldn’t have been doing in standard tuning. Anyway, that probably makes me sound like an asshole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: No, no. The rest of the interview made you sound like one. Thank you. Can we do, “Ok Bye?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;C: That’s my sign-off!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I know. I’m stealing it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Dale Turner</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;who-is-dale-turner&quot;&gt;Who is Dale Turner?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dale is one of the most talented, funny, extraordinary people in the Los Angeles area. He plays every instrument in western music. Overall A++ guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-does-dale-do&quot;&gt;What does Dale do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dale Turner is a guitar teacher at &lt;a href=&quot;http://mi.edu&quot;&gt;Musician’s Institute&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guitarworld.com/dale-turner&quot;&gt;transcriptionist and journalist at Guitar World magazine&lt;/a&gt;, and multi-instrumentalist based in Los Angeles, CA. He’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.intimateaudio.com/books.html&quot;&gt;transcribed a zillion albums&lt;/a&gt;, was an editor for Guitar One magazine, and is as humble as he is talented. His 2010 album, &lt;em&gt;Mannerisms Magnified&lt;/em&gt;, is a fantastic release in which he played every instrument, wrote all the lyrics, mixed, edited, produced, and engineered, etc. The songs are unique and fun. You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.carlkingdom.com/collections/cds/products/dale-turner-mannerisms-magnified&quot;&gt;purchase &lt;em&gt;Mannerisms Magnified&lt;/em&gt; from CarlKingdom.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-dale-a-nice-guy&quot;&gt;Is Dale a Nice Guy?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. Super nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-do-you-know&quot;&gt;How do you know?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met Dale via &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/carl-king&quot;&gt;Carl King&lt;/a&gt; in 2011 on Facebook and we met in person shortly after. We connected on several musical influences, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Cornell&quot;&gt;Chris Cornell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/steve-vai&quot;&gt;Steve Vai&lt;/a&gt;, and Carl’s musical personalities Sir Millard Mulch and Dr. Zoltan Øbelisk. Anyone who loves Chris Cornell’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria_Morning&quot;&gt;Euphoria Morning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; album as much as I do is a friend of mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;okay-what-about-his-music&quot;&gt;Okay, what about his music?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mannerisms Magnified&lt;/em&gt; opens with an incredible perverse tribute to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Wilson&quot;&gt;Brian Wilson&lt;/a&gt;, followed by some really cool &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Smith&quot;&gt;Elliott Smith&lt;/a&gt;-inspired songs with complex chord changes and time signatures. There are hints of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Bungle&quot;&gt;Mr. Bungle&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Patton&quot;&gt;Mike Patton&lt;/a&gt; throughout, as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Maiden&quot;&gt;Iron Maiden&lt;/a&gt;. As Dale says in &lt;a href=&quot;/interview/dale-turner&quot;&gt;our interview&lt;/a&gt;, “You can’t escape the Maiden.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interpretations&lt;/em&gt; is an album full of Dale’s interpretations of various pop songs. Armed with his voice and an acoustic guitar, there’s tons to enjoy on here, from silly bird sounds in &lt;em&gt;Blackbird&lt;/em&gt; to a solo operatic arrangement of &lt;em&gt;Bohemian Rhapsody&lt;/em&gt; with plenty of falsetto vocals. There are so many priceless moments and many tender ones as well. Don’t miss his cover of The Beach Boys’ &lt;em&gt;God Only Knows&lt;/em&gt;. Simply wonderful!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think he’s released any other music, but I’m probably wrong about that. Anyway, there’s plenty to check out and enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Andy West</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;interview-video&quot;&gt;Interview Video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April 2015, I interviewed &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/andy-west&quot;&gt;Andy West&lt;/a&gt;. We discussed lots of interesting stuff related to “weird music,” including his influences, what “weird” means, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/meZk10p9dFo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interview-transcription&quot;&gt;Interview Transcription&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Hi this is Anthony from Make Weird Music and I’m here with Andy West from the Dixie Dregs, FWAP, Crazy Backwards Alphabet, all manners of bands…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: The Mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: The Mistakes. Yeah?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah. It’s been many years, but you know, might as well count it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: I wanted to kinda get some background on your musical history and then how you have gotten into the bands you were in, what prompted you to get out of the music industry, and try to get a sense of your compositional method (if you have one). So why don’t we get started with your background? How did you get started with music?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: Okay, so first off I appreciate you asking me to do this. I think it’s an interesting idea. I looked at the website and I see you’re evolving it, putting more stuff there. I think we have to talk about the context of weird music just for a minute here because there’s a couple of avenues here. There’s the experience of it. The learning of it, the hearing of it, the attraction to it, those kinds of things. And then there’s the kind of performance and composition aspects of it, right? You have to start with “Why would anyone be interested in this stuff at all?” I haven’t got a clue. I don’t know why. All I know is that for anyone who is interested in unusual music or weird music or whatever you want to call it—and we can talk about some of these definitions—there’s always some kind of pivotal thing that you hear in their background that said, “Yeah, it was really weird this happened. I was exposed to this and then it’s never been the same.” So I’ve had a couple of those things, they were many years ago. I remember when I was in high school, I went over to my friend’s house to play pool because he had a pool table. But for some reason, this was like in the 7th grade or something and the music he was playing was &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Ra&quot;&gt;Sun Ra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Riley&quot;&gt;Terry Riley&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: I don’t know Terry Riley…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: Oh my God, okay. This is really old stuff, but it’s very avant garde. And then a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Shankar&quot;&gt;Ravi Shankar&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yehudi_Menuhin&quot;&gt;Yehudi Menuhin&lt;/a&gt; “East meets West” album, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Partch&quot;&gt;Harry Partch&lt;/a&gt;. So this guy had a really broad—I don’t know… I think his parents somehow… who knows how or why, but I just remember this music striking me and, of course, I remember all these things. The thing back then was, “Wow, what is this? It’s so different from everything else.” So, there was kind of that that was just an exposure. The other thing was being in Atlanta and, oddly enough, Atlanta had really weird bands. Primarily the Hampton Grease Band. Have you ever heard of them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: Oh my goodness. Okay. I brought this [CD]. This is the “&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_to_Eat&quot;&gt;Music to Eat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;” album by &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampton_Grease_Band&quot;&gt;Hampton Grease Band&lt;/a&gt;. So you can listen to this after I leave and finish this. It came out in the 60s and it’s notoriously the worst-selling album that Columbia ever released. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Hampton&quot;&gt;Bruce Hampton&lt;/a&gt; is the guy that started the Hampton Grease Band. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Phillips&quot;&gt;Glenn Phillips&lt;/a&gt; was his guitar player and there were a lot of others… He’s kind of like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Davis&quot;&gt;Miles Davis&lt;/a&gt; of Atlanta weird music. So all these people would come through his band and they continue to to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Oh, he’s still around?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah, Bruce is a very interesting guy and he’s always attracted the most incredible musicians. This is something that you’ll really enjoy. So, there’s those kinds of things… And this is another one: The Hampton Grease Band turned into Colonel Bruce Hampton and this is just one of probably a half-dozen albums he did around that time. “One Ruined Life of a Bronze Tourist.” So there’s all kinds of weird, very interesting stuff on here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Would you liken his music to anyone else?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: Um, it’s… it’s like… I’d have to say “no.” And I also can’t explain why this band was so popular in Atlanta because when you hear the music you’ll ask the same question. When I lived in Atlanta and I was in high school, I saw a place that was a sports arena, which is where they had wrestling matches but they also had concerts. The day before I moved to Augusta when I was in 11th grade or 10th grade, I was 16, and the day before I moved there I saw the Hampton Grease Band and Fleetwood Mac playing. That was the old &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleetwood_Mac&quot;&gt;Fleetwood Mac&lt;/a&gt;, the bluesy kind of the “&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh_Well_(song)&quot;&gt;Oh Well&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;” Fleetwood Mac, you know? That was kind of interesting. There’s also for me all those avenues which led to those kinds of things. And again, I don’t want to go on and on… I could go on and explain the life history of a human being who’s listened to music his whole life is a long thing… I guess the point I’m trying to make here is that there’s always ways and events that link music to people’s times in their lives that is interesting. You draw on that forever to some degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Absolutely, and for me the purpose of the website to help others discover strange music—not strange like you wouldn’t want to listen to it, but you probably wouldn’t have found it unless someone told you about it… Like, it wouldn’t be something that’s heard on the radio or necessarily shared by your friends unless you have friends that like weird music. I want the site to inspire people to, even if they write straightforward songs, do something that can make it a little interesting for the listener. It’s cool to hear your background in weird music and to hear artists that you’ve discovered, too. I look forward to hearing those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: There’s a list and I have some in my phone to remind me of to talk about. What’s interesting about now versus then is it took a lot of effort to pursue music back then. There wasn’t this instant gratification of “Let’s just go find 25 different amazingly weird things.” We can do that in as long as it takes to click. You’d have to track this stuff down, you’d have to have people who had collections of this stuff. You’d be invested in it. “Okay, let’s listen to this.” It wasn’t like, “Let’s listen to 10 seconds of this and then 10 seconds of that.” This isn’t really about the “bad”-ness of today versus yesterday. It’s just a different kind of thing. Some people read books and some people don’t. They just want the five-second sound byte, the list of headlines. “I want to see the twitter feed.” I was listening to this woman from work today on a little video cast on a work website and she was like, “Here’s why I like social media,” and she was talking—I’m reminded of the &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/frank-zappa&quot;&gt;Frank Zappa&lt;/a&gt; interview where Ted Koppel says, “You’re obviously a very intelligent man, Mr. Zappa.” You know, a back-handed compliment if there ever was one. She’s obviously very intelligent, but she was saying, “I use Twitter as my news feed.” And I’m like, “Oh, okay, you get all your news through Twitter. How interesting…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: The people YOU follow, the people YOU choose…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: As if that’s okay. For me it’s not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Kind of curates your own bubble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: At the same time, I totally understand it. Obviously this person has found something they’re comfortable with hearing or seeing or whatever. So anyway, I was thinking about this. There’s lot of stories to tell that are probably really boring because who cares, at some point. Maybe you want to have on your site just a link to every kind of thing because literally it’s all out there. You can find out the whole history of the Hampton Grease Band if you search right now. For me, there’s a lot of these things. That was where I kind of fell into this. I started as a musician just like many people kind of from a rock and roll perspective with popular music. The Beatles were the thing and then it became Hendrix and then Jefferson Airplane and I was just attracted to it for whatever reason. And the counterculture. I remember the principal at our school would come by and say, “My little hippies. What are you guys doing?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: That’s interesting. I bet there’s a whole other way of thinking that you probably have living through that era. For me, my dad just had those records. I didn’t know that it was counter-culture or different or anything. For me, he was in this band and I would hear him rehearse and they would play Jethro Tull, Genesis, Van Der Graaf Generator… I didn’t know that it wasn’t normal. My mom just listened to different music. I just tended to not like that music as much. I don’t know if there’s an explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: I honestly don’t think there is. I think there’s just something inside people that draws out their curiosity in different ways. Some people are really attracted to understanding sports and team sports and individual sports, etc. Some people are really attracted to books. They like really hard-to-follow challenging things. Others like these really breezy stories that will just hold their attention until they stop. It’s inexplicable to me. But if you never are exposed to this stuff or even think about it, you might miss something. Although, sometimes I wonder about that too. Maybe everything is exactly as it should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: It reminds me of that Zappa quote how music without any sort of weird notes is like watching a movie with no antagonist or eating cottage cheese. Yeah, you should be challenged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: Well, how challenged?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: That I don’t know. Especially if you listen to music for entertainment. Should you really be challenged by your entertainment? I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: I don’t know either. But, you can find beauty in different things. I mentioned the experience in high school and then when I moved to Augusta, Georgia is when I met Steve Morse and we started the Dixie Dregs. There’s lots of stuff on the internet about the Dregs and it’s easy to find. The simple story is that Steve was a very unique composer and guitar player who practiced all the time, like many of these guys who are great do. They just, for some reason, that’s what he did and he started to pull things out of the air that the rest of us couldn’t imagine. So we followed and it was great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Did you meet in high school?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah. What’s interesting is that the Dregs took on a kind of persona of Steve’s music. Even concurrent to that, for me, I was exploring all these kinds of things. I was coming from Atlanta listening to the Hampton Grease Band and all these other things. I brought this Bartok string quartets album because when I was in college, this was the stuff that just got to me. I don’t remember how I first heard it. When I did, I was just like, “What is this?” And it was not like “tweaky” or something that you’ve never seen before and you think, “How bizarre is this weird geometric thing?” It was this really wonderful beautiful thing and I couldn’t even imagine how it happened. I couldn’t really see the path from what I knew to that. It was, again, inexplicable. Whereas if you listen to the more classical Bach or Beethoven, you can hear these threads and you can feel a different kind of thing. This to me was a little bit inexplicable. Years later, I started to understand his folk music connection and his own way of thinking and I read about how he thought about some of this stuff and what he did. I learned a little more about it, but I am definitely not a music scholar or anything like that. I just listen and like this stuff. So, that was something that really, really got to me as well was finding this kind of modern advanced kind of classical music and going back in time to Schoenberg and Stravinsky and all that kind of more angular radical stuff. The other thing is I wonder now from a vantage point of history and consumption, having a lifetime of consumption of this stuff, and you say for example, “No, I’ve never even heard of the Hampton Grease Band,” it’s like, “Wow, I’m so surprised considering how much I have found that you DO know about that old stuff.” Part of me says, “How important is that old stuff?” And it’s probably not very.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: There’s sentiment and importance and it’s hard to tell the difference sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: That’s another thing. I try to understand, “What is the value of currency?” meaning “current now?” How important is it right now that people are doing something that kind of in a way has already been done, but if it’s now, it’s different? I don’t know, have you thought about that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: I have a bit, especially with these remixes of these old albums where Steven Wilson, in particular, has been remixing King Crimson, Jethro Tull, Emerson Lake and Palmer or something like that. Anyway, just listening to these albums as remixes makes it almost sound like new music because they clean up the vocals, it doesn’t sound like 1970s tape with 1970s mastering and the drums have pillows stuffed in them. It sounds more like modern music and I wonder when I hear it… when I pop in Gentle Giant’s “Power and the Glory” on blu-ray, it feels new, I know the music very well, and then I think, “Man, this is even more non-standard, out of left field… If it was released today, who knows if they could have gotten anywhere with it?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: Well, you know, there’s been so many notes played and there’s so many words written and there’s so many movies made… It’s like a big massive stream and you wonder kind of what is going to continue to pop out or matter. It’s curious to me, I don’t really have a strong opinion on it because no matter what I think or do, stuff is going to happen and people are going to pursue weird stuff. You’re going to write the Moby Dick album. Somehow, some way that happened. And I think it’s all good. I do think that for people that want to pursue it, it’s interesting to kind of tug on a thread. We started the band and had a little bit of a hiatus and then came back together into the more modern band after Steve had gone to University of Miami and I want to bring that up because when I went down there, that was when I started to get exposed to jazz. I had no idea about “jazz.” It didn’t mean anything to me. For example, in the University of Miami when I first walked in to the main room where we would have small group rehearsal or larger classes and this kind of thing, there was a picture of Coltrane on the wall and I was like, “Who’s that?” And they looked at me like I was nuts. But the interesting thing about that is, for me in the 90s, somehow I started listening again to Miles Davis and then Coltrane and I went backwards through that whole catalog and consumed it and I was like, “Oh my God.” Talk about weird music! If you really put yourself in the time when that music was made… How could it be? How could it even happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: I totally get that. I sometimes will listen to The Residents and I wonder, “How did that happen?” Like “Hello Skinny…” What possessed anyone to do that, whether it was then or now, to tell this very strange story…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: I don’t remember the song exactly…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: It goes “Skinny was born in a bathtub and grew so incredibly thin that even the end of an eyedropper sucked him in.” The lyrics are so strange and there’s this terrifying black and white video and they melded the art with the music in this very strange product. It’s almost timeless. You couldn’t tell if somebody made it last year or 30-40 years ago. I wonder about that. These anomalous music products, how did they come out of nowhere? The brain that made them ended up making all this other stuff and it just becomes a part of their portfolio, but for me it’s kind of a milestone and it’s fun for me to think about how we interpret the work of other people, how artists generally hate what they’ve done and move on… Like my friend Carl King, he doesn’t want to make music ever again and I think, “What a shame. He’s such a great talent.” But, for him, he hated the way his music was going…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: Well, you know, it’s about living a life. It’s not about…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Entertaining others?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah. The idea of this—you actually mentioned a couple things and I want to pull these out because I didn’t want to forget about these things. I had The Residents on here as one of the topics just because it’s a crazy thing. Even Devo, they were very weird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah. Mark Mothersbaugh, I don’t know if he would have made it as a musician, but he’s still doing lots of interesting new stuff. Those guys, it’s probably a passion for them. They probably would continue to do it if they were destitute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: Even things like Chick Corea and Keith Jarrett. The first time I heard Chick Corea was from exposure at the University of Miami. I remember the album of solo improvisations and it was so striking to me, like the Bartok thing. “Where is this even coming from? I don’t understand this. I really like it. It’s not like noise to me.” That took a lot facility. That wasn’t like a “folky” thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: How do they prepare themselves to do that? Do they think it’s that outlandish? As a musician yourself, maybe you’ve produced something like that where somebody goes, “What the heck is that about? How did he do that?” And you have a very laymen explanation for it that’s probably not that interesting to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: To go down the path of creating music that’s no normal, I think the first thing there is to do it for yourself. For some reason you find this really interesting and you really hope that others do, but it’s not a criteria. It’s not a motivator. What’s motivating is, “Where did this come from? It kind of fell out of my fingers, or it was a sound that I like that I want to repeat.” It’s really easy to do weird stuff now. Again, when I started on this, I didn’t have the capacity to hear everything in my head. Steve is like that, many musicians are like that where somehow it’s just “in there” and it’s just about getting facility to pull it out. I’m more about tugging on things and seeing what I can find there. For me, when we first had 4-track tape recorders, getting the Teac 4430 was the first one that changed everything where suddenly people could have multi tracking in their own home. How crazy is that right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: I recorded stuff on that machine when I was about 14 years old on that machine, the 1/4” 4-track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: It’s awesome. And I learned a lot about writing doing that, too, because I would figure out a little pattern. During this time, Steve would write occasionally things in odd times. The other thing that happened was a distinct kind of shift in his skills. When we were in high school, we wrote more rock-oriented things and we’d play that kind of stuff. Then he went to University of Miami and got exposed to jazz. The Mahivishnu Orchestra was out at that time. All that kind of stuff happened. Mahivishnu was one of those things where it’s like, “Okay if we’re going to learn any of this stuff” (which we did because we were like a Mahivishnu cover band). So, they were really weird because they were always doing these things in odd times so everything was about counting. When you’re young and you’re just counting—anyone can feel 4/4, 3/4, etc.—when you start to break it down and you have these choppy combination rhythms—7/8 and 5/8 makes 12, kind of—for us, just learning those songs really pulled out the weird rhythms. That became a whole fascination for me. It was interesting hearing the thing Carl [King] was talking about. I just listened to it because I was trying to catch up on that thing and I remember having a similar kind of thing (it wasn’t as advanced as he was thinking about with rhythms)…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: The borrowed rhythms?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: For me, it was just like, “Oh, polyrhythms of 3 against 4… how do you break that down?” And then starting to count and tap that out. Exploring that whole thing. Nowadays, it’s totally easy in a sequencer to hear that stuff. Put it in, play around with it…For me when I like to write, that’s kind of what I’ll do. I’ll pull something out of the bass guitar, or maybe a synth sound, and then if it has a feeling—because I like odd rhythms, but it’s not a requirement—it’s easy to put in and you can start to think, “Oh maybe I should have a bass line here, or maybe this should have something flowy here or maybe a weird sound here…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Do you—might be getting ahead of us—but is that how you construct things? Is it kind of piecemeal based on what you’re hearing at the time? Construction set kind of thing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: I would say so. I don’t think of songs in total. I do think very traditionally in some ways about sections. I like to have a song go from somewhere to somewhere with repeated sections and typical forms. Build them up, really build them up from something that runs through, a rhythmic pattern or a chordal pattern or a bass line and then start to layer on so it really is constructing or building up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Before computers were a major part of the music industry, were you doing everything by writing it out? Working by ear with other people or by yourself and recording to tape?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: Mainly by ear, not a lot of written stuff unless I needed to for some reason or I was trying to remember something. I do have a lot of old pieces of music paper with lines on them. When I would write something and didn’t have a tape deck, I would write it down so I wouldn’t forget it. As long as I can remember, it was really about capturing ideas on tape and going back to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Do you feel like the things you grew up listening to or the eras of when you discovered Coltrane and Miles Davis, do those things fill gaps in your musical emotional state of being? Or do they motivate you in a certain direction? Do they provide influences for you? What does that do when you become obsessive about…?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: I appreciate it when I’m drawn into music. It happens less now than it used to. Sometimes I think about re-exploring that stuff. It’s not like you hear it for the first time and it’s just in you, so that’s kind of a positive thing to me. “Oh you know, someday I’ll go back and revisit that and really listen to that again.” Every now and again I’ll do something like that, like when I was going through that jazz thing and I discovered Miles and Coltrane and I discovered people like Bill Evans. Then you read all this history and how people talked about Bill Evans and it’s like, “What’s all this?” And the first time you hear his music you’re like, “Well, this isn’t really that amazing.” But then all of a sudden you’re in it and it’s like, “Wow. What the heck? This is really special. This is really different. It’s not just jazz. It’s something really different.” I don’t know how to explain it. For me, I’d like to know more about that. I’d like to go in and dig in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Do you find tactics or techniques or maybe it makes you feel a certain way and you think, “I’d like to understand that better?” Or is it just like, “Oh, that’s cool. I should try that sometime.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: I think it should be all about feeling. I was thinking to myself the other day the kind of athleticism of the music I played in my 20s and the challenging nature of “can I even execute this?” kind of thing. And that’s kind of a cool thing, but I would much rather feel a sense of beauty, power, sadness, than “wow! amazing!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: “Another guy that can play really good.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: The other thing is the bar is raised so high, this is just where you want to focus. A lot of times, I’ll spend a Saturday morning on YouTube and just go, “Oh my God, what’s going on here? Where are these people coming from? How did they get here?” The musicianship is so astonishing. I have a deep appreciation for that level of skill, but at the same time you can listen to a Tom Waits song and be completely blown away, which is also pretty weird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Absolutely. And the stylization of the sound of his music is a whole other thing to get immersed in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: So, when you think about weird music, there’s all these threads. That’s why I’m almost struggling with the term “weird” because weird can be funny. Funny is good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: And I actually want it to be open. I want it to be anything. It should just be “not so predictable.” It should just be “not so conformist.” Even if it’s I-IV-V, make it asymmetrical, add a beat, do something strange between the chords, take a major and make it a minor. Just do something that makes it like, “Whoa! I didn’t see that coming.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: It’s funny. I can’t remember when this was. Some time when I was at work over the past 30 years and someone found out I was a musician, this woman, and I remember talking to her and she said, “Oh yeah, I love music! Whitney Houston is my favorite!” And of course I had a knee-jerk reaction to that because, while Whitney Houston as a vocalist was certainly skilled and proficient, the music did nothing for me at all. And talk about formulaic, it’s kind of like, “Well, we’re going to do a song that does ‘this.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yep. “This is the [dynamic] curve.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: Again, you want to check yourself because it’s not about being an elitist, but it’s about “well, okay, I’m happy that someone appreciates music at all!” Because it’s almost kind of rare these days. At the same time, you’d hope that they would go further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: That’s the thing about “weird.” Sometimes, the listener doesn’t even have to know that you went further. You can do things in such a way that sounds perfectly normal to the big Whitney Houston fan, but in the background, you’re like, “I used a non-diatonic chord there and that’s what makes that cool.” Or, even Outkast’s “Hey Ya,” which has a bar of 6 in the chorus and that, to me, is “that’s cool! I like that!” It’s a really simple, stupid song and it’s fun and totally entertaining, but there’s a bar of 6 in it and I think, “That’s weird and he did that and that’s cool.” So, what is normal to you? To define “weird,” we should have a sense of normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: I am really not a fan of pop music at all. I just don’t appreciate it anymore. There’s amazing skill (if you will) when you think about some of these singers. Because of the internet and TV and everything else, the best ones are going to rise up. The big eye’s looking for attention, who’s going to pop up? “Not quite there, not quite there, not quite there, oh wow! That’s pretty high.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: And it’s a whole package thing. The look, the stage presence, all that stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: I just find it really boring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Is that what “not weird” music is for you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: Probably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: What does the term “weird music” evoke for you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: I can find an emotional content in a lot of things that have unusual tonalities or instrumentation, that kind of stuff. If I was going to say “weird,” it would be that. It would be a recognition that this is not what is commonly done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Out of conformance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah, there’s some aspect to it that makes it attractive and unique in that way, but I always go back to “How does it actually make me feel?” If I feel a certain way, then I can start to dig into an analysis of what it actually is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Do you consider the music you’ve written or performed on over 20 albums weird music?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: Well, I don’t think the Dregs is weird at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Really?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah. That music has clear roots. You can sort of trace back and see where it’s coming from and either you appreciate that or you don’t. One of the things that we did that I think is common to the kind of music that I like is we actually played it. We had ourselves in it. Yes, it’s a performance, but we were a band in the best sense of the word. We knew each other, we liked each other, we lived with each other. There was a lot of connections there. And I think that comes through. When you see a band play and musicians are communicating, they’re communicating on some sort of cerebral level. It’s about the feeling that’s coming through the music. That’s awesome! It’s awesome when you see that. It’s so wonderful. It’s so different than “there’s the star and there’s the backup players and here’s a sound” and “Oh, I love this song!” It’s not like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: For me, that’s interesting mostly because a lot of my music and musical influences are solo, multi-instrumentalist-type people who lock themselves in the studio and it’s them and maybe a couple other people. There’s no band. But, it’s “this is the product of my hands.” I do love a lot of band music, but I go to see live bands to support them and to see that music performed live. It’s cool to understand the dynamics and stuff. But, often there’s a different drummer and a different bass player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: Sometimes great songs are great songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: But, that’s cool that that’s such a part of the experience for you with the Dixie Dregs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah, and it’s also what I look for when I hear other musicians play. The MIM here is great and you’ve told me about a couple of things. I went and saw Steve Gadd and Jimmy Johnson and some other session players. This guy, I forget the guitar player’s name, but he’s a great guitar player. Kind of one of these guys that you wouldn’t know about but he’s played on a gazillion albums. These are all older guys, but they were just so happy to be playing. They were all masters of their instruments. The music wasn’t weird, it was just a joy to listen to, though. So, that was another kind of thing that you can draw on that is part of this whole music thing. Back to the “weird” thing, now you compare and contrast that with…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Crazy Backwards Alphabet, perhaps?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah. Sure. That’s actually a very interesting conversation because I met &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Kaiser_(musician)&quot;&gt;Henry Kaiser&lt;/a&gt;, who’s another guy who I learn so much from. He’s like a musicologist. I haven’t seen Henry in many years but I’m thinking about it now because when I used to go over to his house, I would always just say, “Okay, what do you have?” And he would pull something out and say, “Here, listen to this.” All this amazing music. I can’t remember what his website is, but if you do a search, you can find him. He’s got a list of a hundred or more different things, each of which definitely qualifies as “weird” and each of which is wonderful and amazing in its own way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: On Henry Kaiser’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah. I recently found it and he had redone it, but the links are still there. You probably want to put a link to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: How did that get started? How did that band get incarnated?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: I met Henry through this guy, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ggould.com&quot;&gt;Geoff Gould&lt;/a&gt;. He’s a bass maker, he started Modulus graphite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: He made the current basses you have, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah. And Jeff lives in San Francisco and he made instruments for Grateful Dead, for Phil Lesh. He’s been around for a while. He started this whole graphite thing and one day I was visiting him in his shop and Henry came in and he introduced me and said, “Oh yeah, you guys should get to know each other.” I got to know Henry when I lived in San Francisco. We just stayed in touch. I can’t even begin to describe how he plays guitar because it’s very unusual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah, I watched a few videos and the one of your bass video all those years ago. That was really interesting, his technique, his ideas, everything about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: He’s so out there. For me, again, he’s just a really smart guy and a really great guy to be around. I felt like when I was around him I was learning stuff. I guess that made me very open to these different approaches. He was really into Captain Beefheart and I never listened to anything by Captain Beefheart. He had this idea to put this band together. He had met this drummer from Sweden and said, “Let’s try and do something.” It was all his idea. He would bring these songs in and one of them was this Captain Beefheart song. I think it’s on one of these albums. If I get the title right, I think it’s “A Carrot is the Same as a Diamond to a Blind Horse.” It’s this really weird title. But, the whole thing about playing this was the patterns on the bass and the song itself was just so unusual and weird, but to play it, what I did was I didn’t think about rhythm, per se. What I learned playing with Henry was that rhythm—the Dregs was the exact opposite. It was: Here’s the beat and you’re playing just on top of it, a little behind it. You learn all these things as a musician that are exactly how you’re going to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: It’s precisely constructed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: It’s precision. Yeah. Precision can create a lot of amazing feels. It’s not all about being mechanical, right? But, you’re precisely dragging. That kind of stuff. With Henry and these guys, it was very different. It was, “Okay, we’re going to start here and we’re going to end here.” And what happens in between is stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: That’s interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: So we would play. At first I was really disconcerted by this whole thing because I’m very used to playing with precision and particularly drummers who are super-precise and great. As a bass player, it’s wonderful because I don’t have to think. I can just play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: You feel, you communicate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: So with this other thing, it was really different. Then I started to have a lot of fun with it. “This is really cool. It’s really, really different.” It was all about that kind of thing, like trying to understand rhythm from a different perspective. And the song, it’s like I’m not playing the song with precision, what I’m doing is playing a feeling and it starts “here” and it ends “here.” It was really cool and we had a great time with that. As a matter of fact, the follow-on to that is when I met Mike Keneally at a NAMM show, I didn’t know who Mike was, but I saw him play with Dweezil. They had this band in the early 90s and they were doing this crazy stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Is that Z?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: It was pre-Z. Bryan Beller was in the band and Mike and they were at the NAMM show and they did this thing. They had this famous medley they did that was about a bar and a half of 50 or 70 songs. It was incredible and it just flowed from beginning to end. I was talking to Mike and he didn’t mention the Dregs. He said, “I really like that Crazy Backwards Alphabet album.” That was the first conversation we had and I was like, “Oh, I like this guy because he’s talking about something different.” And he knew Henry and that was like, “Oh, we’ve been talking about doing something. Maybe this would be a catalyst.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: How did John French get involved?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah, so John was the drummer in Beefheart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Drumbo, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah. That was the Crazy Backwards Alphabet thing. So, there was Drumbo and the guy from Sweden and he tracked down Drumbo. I guess Henry knew everybody in Beefheart’s band because he was just a fan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Beefheart didn’t have fans. He had fanatics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: Drumbo was great. We did a couple of his songs on that album and he put out an album that I played on that was part of that whole time. It was pretty cool. He was just a guy living out in somewhere way out in… I forget what that valley is up north of LA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: There’s a lot of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah, I see it in my head. You go up the 5 and you turn right and you’re off in there. It was the desert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Logistically, how did all that work out? Were you making a living with this weird band?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: Well, no. My little part of the story is that I got to be really good as a bass player for the Dregs, but I was really not a good journeyman musician. I really don’t like to play other people’s music if I don’t really love it somehow. The thing with Henry, we did a couple of gigs. Even The Mistakes did a gig or two. But, that was just so narrowly focused, there was no way to make money doing that really. The Dregs was kind of a miracle to make money. When the band broke up the first time and I moved to California, I just gave lessons and tried to play in different bands and really didn’t find anything. That’s when I started getting into computers and software and that whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: What was that like for you? Was there remorse or any sort of sadness moving on? Or was it more like: “This was so hard, I’m glad to find something reliable?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: This doesn’t have so much to do with weird music, but it’s interesting perhaps. For me, there was a lot of turmoil in the sense that I really loved the band and I loved being in the band. It got to be very difficult. We got to the point where we weren’t getting anywhere. We had a lot of issues with the business people and this kind of stuff. We just really worked hard and kind of burned out a little bit. I think Steve was ready to go to the next level, which he did. For me, it was just like, “Okay, what’s next?” I’d always been interested in computers, so I was attracted to that. When I got my first job in software, I was thrilled to get a paycheck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Something reliable every two weeks…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah! It was like, “What am I gonna do?” I had lived the life of a musician through my 20s. It was very experiential. I worked really hard to be in the band, but a lot of it was just living life. I had no idea what corporate America was like. I’d heard about it. I knew there was a lot of people that worked jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Did you enjoy your life as a musician? Or was it more about, “I loved playing music and everything else was secondary?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: It’s hard to say. I think I was kind of a pragmatist about it all. I do love playing music, and I did. I wasn’t willing to go down with it, per se.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Maybe Steve was, based on his desire to go to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: Steve was just… There were a lot of issues with us and our business. The fact that we kind of had done the same thing for a while and it had just stopped in a way. We were successful, but we weren’t wildly successful. We had to keep working and at some point, it just doesn’t seem as much fun to go into the same old clubs and do it over and over and over. You want something a little different. Again, part of that is just the essence of being young and youthful and dissatisfied, not knowing anything. Steve was just such a consummate musician. Rod the same way, and T. Allen also at the time was the first violinist and he just wanted a normal life, too. So, he went off and got his medical degree. Mark O’Connor was in the band for a little bit. Some of these guys are just like, “I’m going to do whatever it takes. I’m me and this is it.” And they could pull it off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: I’d just read an interesting quote from JK Simmons. You’ve seen him in a lot of things, but… He said for himself he couldn’t even think of anything else to do with his life than act. He said, “That’s how I knew because I had absolutely no other interests. And even if I realized, this is really hard, I should find something else, nothing came to me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: That’s exactly how I was when we started the band and through the time that we had the band. What happened for me was right around the time I turned 30, I started to think of other things. “Why am I limiting myself?” in a way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: I know you think the Dregs music is straightforward and not weird, but it’s very complex and very difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: I’ll give it that for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: And certainly precise! It’s definitely not pop music. It’s hardly blues/jazz/rock. It’s a fusion of many different things. What level did you have to exert yourself and make it so it was reasonably accessible so you could make money? Was there anything like that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: The only thing we did was we were a live band. We understood when we played how a crowd responded to our songs, so we would try to build it to a peak as we’d go through a show. We always had a formula to our albums if you listen to them. There’s always a couple of rockers, there’s always a celtic/bluegrass-y thing in there, there’s a symphonic long-form thing, which I love all those things. They’re great. So we had a way of kind of performing through that stuff. That was kind of “manipulative,” if you will. We thought about that. In terms of the actual music, the only thing is we were trying to become more successful. I won’t say “make more money,” it was really more about becoming more successful and trying to get to a different level. The only pressures we ever had were from the record company and people trying to help us in some weird way. So, Clive Davis, when he signed with Arista, he had us in his office to talk about what we were doing. He’s a really weird guy. Have you seen him on TV? Do you know who he is?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah, I can visualize him, but I don’t know why I’ve seen him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: He’s one of these classic record producer, record company owner guys from back then who had a string of gazillion people who he made rich and famous. I think Whitney Houston was in that bunch, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: She was with the singer from Gentle Giant, actually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: Oh, Derek Shulman?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Yeah, Derek Shulman was her A&amp;amp;R guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: Clive used to be one of these guys. All I remember is going into his office and he was like, “Yeah, you know, it’s really…” He was really kind of vague. All he could do was play us Jeff Beck’s Wired and said, “You should think about this.” And we didn’t understand what he was saying. “Are you telling us to play that? Yeah, we like Jeff Beck, but that’s not what we do.” At the same time, we’re like, “How come we’re stuck here? How do we get these people to do this thing?” We had done some tours with Santana and the Doobie Brothers, so that’s when we had this idea of “Let’s get these guys to do something with us. Yeah, they will. They’ll sing a couple of songs with us, some rock tunes with vocals and see if that does anything.” That was about the extent of us trying to manipulate our own success. That was the last album that we all did together. It was called “Industry Standard” for a reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Ah, now that makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: It’s like, “Oh God, people are telling us to…” You know. We were ridiculous. We had fun when we played. We always just felt like, “Well if we do that and people like that and people do respond to that, that’s what we’re going to do.” It wasn’t like a plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Right. It was a thing that worked for a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah. Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: That’s cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: I don’t know any other way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: The most straightforward thing I think in your discography is FWAP. Very blues/rock standard kind of album. Your solo stuff is all over the map. Could you go into how those things have both fit into who you are?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah, sure. Again, I’m kind of a fan of music and the Dregs were kind of a variety act in the sense of what I just was talking about. It’s like we had this kind of thing and this kind of thing and we sort of walk you through those things in a show. FWAP was more… The idea was “Can we do sort of bluesy improvisational music that has some kind of coherence?” Obviously the people in that group could play. They were all professional musicians with years of experience. With that thing, it was fun because it was just when we would play together, we would have fun again. It would gel. It’s hard to explain this kind of thing because unless you’re playing parts or you’re playing like a rock band, there’s a lot of feeling and there’s a lot of cerebral connection. It’s hard to explain, but…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Well, it’s not something to be captured on a disc, but it’s something to be experienced in a live setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: I wonder about this stuff. I don’t really like these kinds of mystical explanations, but there really isn’t a lot of words or science behind it. You just do it. So, that was that. It was really intended as a live thing. I played with Joaquin in this band Zazyn, which was more electronic and fusion-y. He knew Hilary and said, “Let’s try and jam.” When we jammed with Hilary, I was just like, “Whoa, this is great!” She’s another one of those kind of drummers that’s just so fluid and powerful. So, that was kind of cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: What about Rama 2?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: I think I told you I have dozens of unfinished pieces that I’m really just waiting for the time to be able to do them. And I plan on it, and it’s getting close, which is great because I had sort of given up on it for a while. Work takes so much out of you. We’ve talked about this a little bit. So, I can see that happening in a year or two, getting back into creating more music. There’s also this part of me which goes, “Do we really need more notes?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: But, it’s for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: That’s the thing! I’m like, “Well, you know I still want to do it for some reason, so what the heck?” And it’d be great if people listened to it. I have this sort of weird, naive belief that there’s a reason to do it. The way that other album came about was the same kind of thing. I’ve been working with sequencers and tapes forever. After I learned how to program, I thought, “Maybe I should get into this music stuff.” It’s funny, when Carl had mentioned the Atari ST, that was another computer I had. I learned how to program on that. I got a job with this company out of LA that was doing one of the first hard disk recording systems. I can’t remember the name, I’d have to look it up. The sound bite there is I did all this work on this thing and there were a couple of guys there who were brilliant. They were DSP guys. Math guys that really understood the stuff. And they knew a lot about operating systems and they were all musicians, but they had this whole thing. Of course, there was some guy who was “the business guy” and I remember doing all this work and going to get a paycheck and the guy said, “Yeah, come down, I’ll meet you on Thursday” and he wouldn’t be there. He just wouldn’t be there. And I was like, “What?” And finally they got about a month behind paying me and every now and again a check would come. Then I was like, “What the hell?” This is worse than the music business! Honestly, since then, I just remember having this very conscious thought because the guys who were writing this stuff were so creative and cool and the Atari at that time, you had Cubase… I think it was called Cubase then. There were a handful of sequencers coming out. Digital Performer was just coming out on the mac. There was so much cool stuff and creative stuff, but no money. Now you had engineers who were behaving like musicians. They just love what they’re doing so they just do it. Much respect for that, but at that point in my life, I was like, “I thought I was going to make a living!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: “This is not the promise I was looking for!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: Exactly. So then I started doing all this boring business stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: In terms of composition, I think a lot about that Rama album. It’s very diverse, there’s some very complex melody, chord structure, you’ve got amazing musicians on it, but when I think back to the songs, I think kind of like what you were saying earlier: How did he think like that? Do you start with a melody? You mentioned that you’ll hear a sound or something will come out of your fingers…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: Just to walk through those things, the stuff that has a lot of notes in the bass were just bass lines that just “came out.” I was playing and I would find something and usually what I would do is program that into that computer so I would have it there and then I would start to layer things onto it. A lot of those songs got almost done for a long time, then finally I was talking to Mike Keneally and said, “You gotta help me come and finish these things because I’m not finishing anything.” Then he came to my house for 5 days and was like, “Okay, yeah, that’s great.” I had all of these things that were just kind of almost there completely. Where it needed an additional overlay of a melody, he would throw it on there. A lot of that stuff I did have there. So the things with the thumpy bass lines were bass oriented. The weirder sax things came from sounds. I was playing around with sounds in the synth and they would just start to make me think, “Oh, I love the way this sounds!” Every sound that I play, I will immediately will play some melody or chord around it. It just comes out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: For me, I’ll flip through all the patches and think, “Oh, I could do something with that.” It’s more about the potential. I don’t actually create something, but I know something is there. I hear a sound and think, “Nope, doesn’t strike anything in me,” or, “Oh, there definitely is something in there.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: So a lot of that is the sound discovery stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: But it’s primarily in the computer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Do you primarily compose on Logic now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: Yeah. And I also like a 6-string bass for writing. I can always come up with chords and lines and things that you can layer stuff on. It’s not hard to write music for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: I try to wrap these interviews up with: If somebody were to say to you, “Hey, you were a musician! You did it! I like to write music that people don’t listen to.” What would you say to somebody? Mostly it’s a question of my own because that’s my scenario, but, if I were interested in being a full-time musician, would you recommend to that person they do it? They follow their passion? Or, “You know what, you really should be more pragmatic and find something that’ll make you money.” How do you approach those kinds of questions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: Being a human being is complicated. I’ve certainly had my own fair share of dysfunction in my life. I think people can fool themselves into a misguided sense of passion, which is actually kind of running away from responsibility. On the other hand, sometimes those people really luck up and make it. They end up making a living doing whatever it is. You can’t talk to a musician who has made a living who doesn’t say, “I always knew I was going to do this.” There’s a certain amount of luck involved. I think it’s really hard to make a living now doing music. So, I generally tell people if anyone ever bothers to ask, especially when you’re young and you’ve got tons of energy… I used to work and then play music all night. Why not? Then you can get some time to figure it out and figure out what’s important to you. But! There’s lots of tools and lots of cool stuff. The hardest thing is finding other people who think like you to be around and work with if you want to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Do you have any recent recommendations or discoveries of music?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: I find myself actually drawn to ambient music now. There’s so many labels and people that do this stuff, but just the other day I was going into VLC or iTunes, but there’s internet radio by classification or category. You can always discover stuff if you sit down and just go through some of those things and hear things. And there’s always incredible things. For fear of putting any undue focus on one thing for the five people who are going to hear this at some point, I kind of feel like there’s a lot of cool stuff out there, but I don’t even have time to listen or explore everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Well, your recommendation for Avishai Cohen… game-changer for me. So, I thank you for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: That’s cool. If there’s anything of that caliber, I’ll be sure to let you know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Cool. Well, thank you so much for your time. I appreciate you coming to my living room, dealing with all this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;AW: I know, it’s fun. To me, it’s kind of an inspiration to meet someone who is just pursuing this kind of thing or the thought or the line in your own life. You’ve got a dual life going on. Do it while you can. I applaud you for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;AG: Thank you. Cool! Thanks a lot, Andy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AW: Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Andy West</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;who-is-andy-west&quot;&gt;Who is Andy West?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andy West is best known for his work with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dixie_Dregs&quot;&gt;Dixie Dregs&lt;/a&gt;, a 1970s American rock/blues/bluegrass/jazz/classical band known for their virtuosic live performances. They are led by &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Morse&quot;&gt;Steve Morse&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most amazing and versatile electric guitar players I’ve ever heard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-i-know-andy-west&quot;&gt;How I know Andy West&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw the Dregs perform live in Tempe, AZ around 1997 with a friend, who is a huge Dregs fan. During the show, he yelled in my ear, “Hey, that’s Andy West over there! He’s the original bassist from the Dregs!” I never forgot his face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/DOlxUqXDEHA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 10 years later, I was walking around the office at work and bumped into a software development director named Andy West and remembered the face. “Hey! Are you THE Andy West from the Dixie Dregs?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said, “Every once in a while, someone recognizes that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we got started talking about all sorts of weird music, trading CDs, sitting in each other’s cars listening to music on our phones, geeking out, trading software ideas, etc. It actually led to us playing together a little bit with Paul Sears from the super-weird band, The Muffins. Lots of fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-work-with-andy&quot;&gt;My work with Andy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andy and I actually recorded a track together, too, with &lt;a href=&quot;http://sebastianlanser.com&quot;&gt;Sebastian Lanser&lt;/a&gt;, the drummer from &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/panzerballett&quot;&gt;Panzerballett&lt;/a&gt; and a friend of mine, Adam Strand. It’s a wacky interpretation of a movement from a Bach concerto I really enjoy. Here’s a video of it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zfzdqpEhipM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-you-can-hear-andy&quot;&gt;Where you can hear Andy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Andy’s been involved with a lot of cool musicians outside the Dixie Dregs: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_French_(musician)&quot;&gt;John French&lt;/a&gt; (aka “Drumbo” from &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/captain-beefheart&quot;&gt;Captain Beefheart&lt;/a&gt;’s Magic Band), &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Kaiser_(musician)&quot;&gt;Henry Kaiser&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/mike-keneally&quot;&gt;Mike Keneally&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Beller&quot;&gt;Bryan Beller&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Portnoy&quot;&gt;Mike Portnoy&lt;/a&gt;, and many others. His solo album, &lt;em&gt;Rama 1&lt;/em&gt;, blew my mind when I first heard it. Amazing melodies, virtuosic performances, and some really surprising compositions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thanks to the advent of the internet, even some of the more obscure releases in Andy’s discography are readily available on iTunes. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Backwards_Alphabet&quot;&gt;Crazy Backwards Alphabet&lt;/a&gt; albums are pretty surprising. Sometimes, they play very straightforward blues music, but most of the time it sounds like music from another planet. His band, FWAP, is mostly blues/rock improvisation and has some nice moments. Many of the Dixie Dregs albums are on iTunes, which are really cool and fun to listen to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for the people visiting this site looking for weird music, I’d definitely check out his &lt;em&gt;Rama 1&lt;/em&gt; album. Lots of surprises there and fun moments.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Frank Zappa</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;who-was-frank-zappa&quot;&gt;Who was Frank Zappa?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frank Zappa was an incredibly prolific man with an enormous skill set and limitless talent. He was a bandleader, composer, filmmaker, author, studio engineer, record producer, political figure, multi-instrumentalist, businessman, and more. If you want to find out more about the man and his life, check out his autobiography, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Real_Frank_Zappa_Book&quot;&gt;The Real Frank Zappa Book&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;intro-video&quot;&gt;Intro Video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t know anything about Frank Zappa, here’s an intro video I put together. It’s the first video I made for the site, so it could use some improvement, but it’s something!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/MnO91KMP_-w&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;about-his-music&quot;&gt;About his music&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of FZ’s music borrows from blues, rock, doo-wop, and motown, but his discography is quite diverse. He was hugely inspired by 20th century composers Edgar Varese and Igor Stravinsky. He wrote tons of instrumental music, including complex orchestral works, albums with electric guitar solos over all manners of chord progressions, and several extended works of spliced talking, singing, instrumentation, and sound effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of my favorite FZ albums are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Freak Out&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’re Only In It For The Money&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hot Rats&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apostrophe (‘)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roxy &amp;amp; Elsewhere&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;One Size Fits All&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shut Up ‘N Play Yer Guitar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Yellow Shark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FZ used every weird music trick in the book and even invented some of his own. He was known to hire virtuosic musicians in his bands who were expected to play any song in any time signature in any genre. Notable members include: Steve Vai, Adrian Belew, Vinnie Colaiuta, Mike Keneally, Chad Wackerman, George Duke, Tommy Mars, Morgan Agren, and many others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an interview with &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/steve-vai&quot;&gt;Steve Vai&lt;/a&gt; about his audition for Frank’s band.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xx1RguHA4XE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-post-zappa-era&quot;&gt;The post-Zappa era&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Frank passed away in 1993 at the age of 52 after suffering from prostate cancer, his son Dweezil has picked up the musical torch and is touring the world with former Zappa band members in a show called &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zappa_Plays_Zappa&quot;&gt;Zappa Plays Zappa&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a wonderful tribute act in which they have typically performed classic Zappa albums in their entirety followed by an extended set of music. It’s very ambitious and Dweezil is doing an incredible job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I absolutely love this interview he did with the Today Show in 1993, shortly before his death. Despite the interviewer’s inability to ask meaningful questions, Frank’s answers are wonderful and timeless.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Carl King</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-context&quot;&gt;Some Context&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is an interview I did with &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/carl-king&quot;&gt;Carl King&lt;/a&gt; in September 2014. As you will be able to tell, I have the utmost respect for Carl and his art. One thing I learned is that it’s easy to be a fan and difficult to be the artist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carl provides some great insight into his approach to music, how he developed as a musician, and what drove him to make music. It’s interesting to hear how much emotion went into the production of his music and how much of it was negative, which is probably a good explanation for why he no longer produces music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interview-video&quot;&gt;Interview Video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an audio recording and in-video transcription of the interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZD2jVpT3QjQ&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interview-transcription&quot;&gt;Interview transcription&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;Anthony: This is Anthony with MakeWeirdMusic.com and I am here talking to Carl King, also known as the guy who is responsible for Sir Millard Mulch and Doctor Zoltan Øbelisk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Carl: You can hear my birds in the background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yes, we are sitting on his couch in the living room. It’s wonderful. So, Carl, you’ve made a lot of unconventional weird music. How did that get started?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: Gosh, how did that get started? I don’t know that I really realized that I was making weird music at first. My first love of music was John Williams’ Star Wars soundtracks. I had the records and I’d listen to them. So I liked powerful sounding, positive, heroic music and so when I started writing, I started using all major chords and I continued with that throughout almost all my entire musical career, if you want to call it that. Just using heroic sounding major chords. And then I was amused by the sound of weird rhythms. It would make me laugh every time I heard it because it sounded like someone stumbling or being kind of strange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;A: In John Williams’ music? Or in other people’s music?
{: .interviewer } No, just in other music. I guess odd meter was first explained to me by some MI clinic that Steve Vai did in ‘84. I had a VHS tape that was several generations removed from the master. I sat up all night watching that. Actually, that videotape was so educational to me in so many ways. It just broke down everything and I learned a lot of principles there of what you can to with music. How to get good at music. How to practice, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Polyrhythms, tuplets, the discipline of practicing an instrument?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: Not tuplets. I figured that out later on, I think in music theory class. They explained this concept of what you could do and I thought, “Oh, that’s something you can do. I wonder why more people don’t do that. I like that idea. I’m just gonna do that a lot.” So I just took it as far as I could—well, not as far as I could, but to what I liked hearing and thought, “This is fun and I like the sound of this and it doesn’t seem like anyone else does it.” And I actually asked Dave Weckl about it in a clinic. Raised my hand and said, “You do a lot of odd meter, but what about borrowed rhythms?” (That’s what we called it in our music theory class.) And he immediately had what he wanted to say about it. He looked at me and was immediately like, “No. I don’t do that because if I were to do that, people would ask me two questions: 1. What the hell are you doing? and 2. Why are you doing it? I would be out of a job if I started doing that so I just don’t do it.” And all my friends looked at me and laughed and said, “Well, that explains you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Right. Was that an impactful experience for you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: Well, I guess I was disappointed because I love Dave Weckl so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: He’s an amazing player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: He’s my favorite drummer. I’ve gone to see him so many times over the years and I always have a good time watching him play and I really wanted to have him on “my next record.” And he said “no” when I asked him. He said, “I prefer to play with humans.” Which could sound like an insult like I’m not a human, but anyway. But, yeah, I was disappointed that he didn’t want to also do that because I thought, “This is an area that is so interesting. Why don’t more people want to do that?” So I kinda felt alienated. “I like this, why don’t other people like it?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So you took music theory class. Did you have formal training in your music?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: Only later on when I was like 20 or 21 years old. 21, I think. I enrolled in the local community college. The music department was run by this woman who was a Catholic piano virtuoso who gave up on… apparently, she had a really promising career. She was an amazing pianist and she gave it up because she fell in love with her husband and she was very religious and decided to be a part of her local community and stay and do her thing and educate people. It was amazing how much she could do. You could turn the music upside down and she could play it. She was unbelievable. At the time that I composed “Broccoli,” or “A Brief History of Broccoli,” or what later became known as “Gnomon - He Who Discerns and Reveals, Movement DCCLXXVII” on the Zoltan record. I remember I was writing that and I had the sheet music and I pulled her into a practice room with a piano and I was like, “Could you look at this and tell me what you think of what’s going on here? And could you play some of this?” And she said, “Oh sure.” And she was playing it with one hand and pointing to the sheet music with the other and saying, “Oh this is interesting here as you go through this,” and just playing it with no problem. I was blown away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: A real musician.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: Yeah. She was amazing and highly principled and strict, but also very loving towards all the students and really wanted us to do good. I actually quit after my second semester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: That was when you were 21 or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: Yeah, I quit in my second semester and went back to work at the same print shop that I worked at in high school and I was like, “I don’t want to be in college. I’ve learned enough and I know what I want to know and now I’m going to work and save up and do my music. I don’t want to be in college.” I hated college because I learned so fast. I didn’t show up on the first day of semester 3 and I get a phone call at the print shop. She somehow found me and right after class said, “Why aren’t you in my class? I want to see you tomorrow in class. You are too good at this. You have too much of a future in music. You need to be here.” And the head of the music department was this other guy and he wanted to send me to the University of Iowa, like totally free. He said, “You have composition blah blah blah. I’ll just get you a free ride. I know everyone there and we’ll send you to Iowa and you can immerse yourself in composition.” And I blew him off and I was so rude and I told him, “I don’t have any interest in that.” I was real cocky back then and really angry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Interesting. So when did you pick up an instrument or a computer to start making music? When did that happen and how did you start? Obviously, you don’t just start with arranging a Bartok piano concerto or extreme polyrhythms… What got you started in all that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: There was this friend of the family named Ron Mountenay. He was a friend of my mom. Kind of a boyfriend every once in a while. He was a really good guy and he lived a few blocks from us in South Venice, Florida. And he’d let me come over to his house. He had so much equipment and he was just hoarding… I don’t know if he just maxed out all his credit cards or what he was doing, but he just built this whole studio in his garage that was always the latest and greatest whatever he wanted. He was kind of letting me hang out there to get away from my home situation and letting me make music. He was kind of a positive influence on me and was really into Mustang Sally and cover tunes. He had an Atari STE computer and he showed me Cubase and Band in a Box. He used Band in a Box a lot, which is basically a lead sheet of chord changes and measure and it’ll write all the backing music for you with loops. It was a really cool tool, but he showed me Cubase where you could program in the specific notes. I think he convinced my mom to buy an STE for me for $100 or something. I took it home and I borrowed a keyboard off him and I just went up in my bedroom and messed with Cubase and was suddenly like, “Wow, I can make it play music! I don’t need to play it! I can make music with this computer!” So my guitar went back into the closet behind a bunch of clothes and it just sat there for a year. I think I was 18 at the time. It was right after high school. Me and my friend Harold would just start typing in weird drum solos and laughing, saying, “I can’t believe it can play a drum solo that fast.” But I didn’t have the imagination yet to fully exploit it, but I just kept messing around with it thinking, “Oh this is going to be so cool.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So, some of those songs are pretty straightforward, but others are a little crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: Well, that stuff there was stuff I did right out of high school, which was a cassette of elevator music called “Nice nice, very nice” and some of that was Band in a Box, but a lot of it was songs that me and Harold made up in our piano class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: You have your Fanatical Video Game Retroverse album…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: Yeah, that’s a compilation album of a whole bunch of other things I did throughout my days with the Atari STE over many years, which I then renamed all the songs and imagined there was a world in which all my music was very popular and used in all sorts of video games and corporate jingles and stuff like that. So, they’re actually pre-existing things on other records I put out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yeah, I used to have copies of some of that stuff from a long time ago, but have since lost them. And then I found the album again thinking, “That song’s not called ‘Aquarium,’ that’s called…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: Yeah. My friends Martin, Chewbode, and Ian made up those named. I just sent them an email saying, “Can you make up a bunch of weird, fake names?” And I just randomly assigned them. There was no thought or correlation to the titles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: There are some really great melodies on that album and some really interesting musical ideas. Obviously you put down the Atari at some point and then started arranging more standard rock instrumentation compositions. Had you been playing the guitar for a long time? You’d mentioned last night you’d played drums for some time. What is your background with those instruments?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: Instruments have always been a problem for me because I originally started out when I was 13 playing guitar and I had a horrible childhood home situation and I didn’t want to be involved in anything. I didn’t want to do anything. I didn’t want to do any homework. I would just hide in my bedroom or hide in the woods across the street from my house and sit by myself and I discovered Steve Vai. “I was the original person who discovered Steve Vai.” No, but his career path and seeing that VHS tape was like, “Oh, this is what I can do to get out of here. Get out of this horrible place.” I just practiced a million hours a day, you know just as much as he says he did. I’d read his interviews and think, “This is what I was going to do.” He was the father who showed up through magazines and videos and helped me get out of my situation. It gave me hope that I could be something else, which is not a unique story, I’m sure. I’m sure there’s lots of fucked up kids who I’m sure have the same story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Mine was less emotional, but I sure went out to buy every Steve Vai issue I could. I cut out all the pictures. Read every single word I could find in print. I could totally relate to that… Practiced a zillion hours…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: I got pretty good, physically, at playing the guitar. Then I got into the computer stuff and started programming and then it took a lot of the frustration away because I could easily hear and see what it sounded like if I did “this” with “this” instrument, or whatever with the drums. And I started getting an idea of what it was like to arrange. I was seeing, “This is what it sounds like when you put a bass drum here.” Just trying every combination I could and thought, “Oh, this didn’t work. I need to remember this principle in my mind.” And you start to learn habits of, “do this, don’t do that.” And your taste. Or, “I like it when I do this with this keyboard.” It was totally listening to music and figuring out, “Why don’t I like it when the snare does this or that?” So then I had to go to the music school and declare a principal instrument and all of that path. At first it was like, “Oh, it’s gonna be guitar because that’s what I play.” And they said, “Well you can either choose classical guitar or jazz guitar.” I said, “But I hate classical guitar. And I hate jazz guitar.” So I majored in composition, but I had to pick an instrument, so I started with jazz guitar and there was this asshole teacher, Greg Bolton, and I had hours of tapes of him just arguing with me telling me that I can’t end a song on a diminished chord. It was such a waste of time. I didn’t want to learn anything this guy was telling me and he told me, “The best thing that can happen to you is just to go join a country band and make money.” And he just kept deflating the dreams I had any any hope of love in music. And he told me, “Oh, you’ll have kids you don’t want and you’ll have to go play in a country bar with music you’re gonna hate.” So I studied with him for a semester and I decided, “I can’t handle this. This is so bad.” So I switched to classical guitar and I bought this shitty student classical guitar, learned from this guy who… I don’t know how to describe it… He was just so vanilla. And I didn’t like him at all and I quit that after that semester and switched to percussion as my instrument, learning from Tom Suta. But the problem was I had no experience with percussion and I was starting at level 0. I started learning how to read drum music and he was like, “There is no way you’re gonna be able to catch up with people who’ve been playing since they were a kid and have a college degree in this.” And I was like, “At least I like playing drums and I can learn.” So I continued studying with him. I played percussion in the local school orchestra. I played snare drum, had a weird snare drum solo at one point, which was just awkward. It was just this weird repeated pattern that went on for a long time while the instructor conducted. Anyway, I did that and I kept on studying with Tom Suta. After I quit, we just kept doing private lessons. He’d drive down to the print shop and I’d get the drum set out of the college and we’d practice sight reading and independence and then I got pretty good at it at that point. And then I switched to learning from Pat McDonald, who drummed on some of my albums. And so, I just kept going to seminars and clinics and got hooked. I thought at some point, “Okay, I’m going to become a drummer.” Like, at some point I decided that. Being a drummer is not easy because where are you going to practice? You have to buy all these drum parts. Not gonna happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Now obviously for anyone who’s listened to your music, the drums are a huge part of your instrumentation and your arrangement. In fact, it seems like drummers are the only guest musicians on your albums. Tell me how, after you somehow discovered Steve Vai—was that the thread you started pulling that led you to other music and helped you find out people like Virgil Donati, Nick D’Virgilio, Morgan Agren? What got you started on these more esoteric musicians?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: I just think that in general drums were may more interesting and detailed. I always felt like when you read guitar magazines, it’s like, “Yeah, getting that sweet tone from that whatever pickup and I like this thing and whatever.” I could never pull much interesting detail out of that. I always felt so bored and when I got into drummers, I thought, “Oh now there’s lots of rich content that I’m interested in.” There was so much more to explore in rhythm because guitarists would rarely get away from “that sweet tone.” Like they were kinda dumb in a way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Well, those magazines don’t really cater themselves to super creative guitar playing, not in an offensive way… It’s a lot of “How to play Led Zeppelin riffs,” or “How to play blues and rock.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: And I never understood why guitarists just seem so dumbed down  compared to the level of academics in drum magazines. They get really specific around rhythms and techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Those articles in guitar magazines are the ones on the crummy, non-glossy paper in the back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: I started getting into Dave Weckl clinics and going to these big drum expos where they’d have Virgil Donati. The seminars were… They were fucking scientists about everything they did… Where they put their snare drum and how high it is and which muscles they were using and their hands… It was like the science of drumming had advanced so far beyond what you’d typically hear from guitarists. So I just got hooked on that because I thought, “This is something I can study and learn and that’s interesting. I could hear the difference.” So I would basically listen to drums all the time. I just loved it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: This is some time around when Sir Millard Mulch came about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: Sir Millard Mulch came about as a name when I was in high school at about 15 because I hated mowing the lawn and I wanted to come up with another name for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: While you were mowing the lawn? Like, “This is my other personality?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: No, no. I was trying to escape my life. It was so bad and I made up another person that I could be. I think there’s some tradition of doing that I’ve heard somewhere where people… part of becoming a man or something where you get your real name when you… Is it Jewish or something like that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Well, there is some of that with the Bar Mitzvah when you turn 13. Now it’s less about labor and doing intense things. Now it’s just a line you cross with study and songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: Well, I came up with this name and suddenly I was Millard. And I started asking people to call me Millard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yeah, I never knew you as Carl. I asked you your name once and you were embarrassed to tell me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: Yeah. It was a way for me to be someone else. Millard could do things that Carl couldn’t do. I wasn’t afraid of anyone at my high school and I was Millard and I’d just walk proudly through the place. Nobody could mess with me. At least that’s how I felt in my mind. I was now Millard. Where did we go? I lost the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So, you had the Atari when you were out of high school, then you started attending some schooling and formal lessons in your early 20s. When did you start making music with the traditional rock instrumentation? How did that start? The Sir Millard Mulch stuff got increasingly complex over time. The initial releases, at least when I listened to them, I didn’t feel like you were fully exploring the complexities and intricacies that you would end up exploring later on in your career. So, when did Sir Millard Mulch start making “rock music” and not just “computer music?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: Well, I played in a group with my friends in a band called Voice of Nothing. I played with a clean tone and we tried to write music even though we had no idea what we were doing. It was kind of terrible. We were just trying to figure it out. It ended up sounding… I don’t think there’s many bands that sound like that. It’s not even weird in a good way, I think. Then we reformed and I started playing bass and I was playing with a pick and played with lots of distortion and we called ourselves Tepado. I started learning about rhythm sections at that point. I started kind of bossing the drummer around saying, “We need to hit on that beat together.” And started learning arranging. I tried applying the same kinds of concepts from my programming to our punk rock weird progressive punk trio. He wasn’t very cooperative because he–and I’m not saying that to attack him—he wasn’t cooperating with me and there was a lot of resistance because I think he thought a lot of that stuff was bullshit and he just wanted to play music and he didn’t want to be bossed around or told what music theory terms… “Can you play softer at this part?” “No! Fuck you! Buy me softer drums if you want me to play quieter.” I couldn’t do what I wanted to do there because I was moving into music theory and complexity. We couldn’t do odd meters because he’d get mad about that and whatever. So I went to a drum lesson with Pat McDonald and I brought my bass in and I brought the Broccoli sheet music and I suddenly realized that I was way beyond what I thought I was because suddenly I was playing with Pat McDonald. Everything sounded amazing to me. It was so far… “Oh I’m an actual musician. I’m actually real good! I didn’t know!” So I hired Pat to play in the studio with me. During the time that I was doing the computer music, I had friends that were complaining to me. “Oh, it sounds like a video game. It doesn’t sound like a real band. If you could just really play it with real instruments.” I always got shit on for that. Like, it wasn’t really real and people always liked “real” music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: There’s no value in the composition, only in the performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: I always was like, “I’m gonna somehow do this with real musicians, but it’s so expensive and there’s nobody in Florida who can play it.” And Pat moved away and there was nobody left in Florida. I was left again, alone. The new version of Cubase on Mac could record audio and I got that and went with my mom’s credit card and spent about $3,000 on stuff at Thorobred music in Sarasota. Brought it all home and hooked it up and realized, “I can now edit the audio and move notes around.” That’s when I recorded the Yasmine Bleeth thing on my mom’s back porch with dirty clothes and a cat litter box. But, yeah, that was the tool. Now I can copy and paste parts and sync things up in ways I never could before. And I can now record anything and make it sound like a band is playing. To me, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: When did you release Yasmine Bleeth?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: 2001. Right before 9/11.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: And Morgan Agren is on that album. How did that happen? Some dude in Florida, before the internet was really huge, there was no twitter, it wasn’t easy to email people…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: Yeah, well I had heard Frederik Thordendal’s “Special Defects” and Morgan was doing the concepts that I wanted to do. I thought, “Oh, he’s already doing it! It’s incredible. I need to get this guy to drum on my album.” And the Yasmine Bleeth thing was intentionally trying to do a radio style rock thing because I was listening to a lot of nu-metal, like Linkin Park. I tried to do my best to make it sound like that. At least as good as I could in my bedroom or my mom’s back porch. I looked up Morgan Agren on the internet and he wasn’t that hard to find and I emailed him through his website, which I think was a terrible website back then, and he was completely amazed that someone on the other side of the world had heard his music. He was like, “Of course! Wow! Thank you!” I’m sure he wasn’t making much money back then anyway. I think I paid him $500 and he recorded it on ADAT tapes. So I bought an ADAT machine off of ebay and hooked it up and I could only record the tracks 2 at a time off the ADATs and it was a 16-track double-tape sync. I had to record them out of the 1/4” jacks into some adapter into 1/8” stereo input on the back of my mac 2 tracks at a time and re-sync them back up and hope that Cubase would play 15 tracks of audio at the same time and somehow mix it and make it sound good. I moved a few parts around here and there because he was really experimental and weird and doing some real strange shit on some of the songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Was there any fanfare around that release? Did you print real CDs? Did you sell them? Perform?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: Yeah, I printed real CDs and spent $2,000 on radio promos. A company called vision-something. I paid them to get me on college radio and it did pretty well on several stations and it kind of got this school called… I don’t remember… In Orange County, CA. It was a Christian college out in Orange County and they would play it all the time on their radio station. It lasted for 16 weeks in their top 10 and they asked me to come and perform at their college. And I laughed because I couldn’t even play those songs and I didn’t even have a real band. “Thank you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So it sold well enough to encourage you to release another album…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: No. It didn’t sell well at all. The sales were terrible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Oh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: I actually threw a lot of the boxes in the trash at some point. It didn’t sell well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: You soldiered on regardless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: Yeah. I actually quit music for the first time after that record. I decided I was quitting and that I was going to get into business. I started reading “Good to Great” and I thought, “Well, music is definitely not in one of the three cirlces of the hedgehog concept.” I threw a bunch of the CDs in the trash and got really angry. I realized I was being stupid trying to do this music thing because it was failing. I started reading sales books and business books and a few months later I was sitting in my graphic design office at the advertising agency. And a girl who was working there named Mary Jo or Mary Ann Jo… something like that. She was weird and quirky and super intelligent, but really screwed up, I think. I couldn’t get through to her or connect with her very well at all. And one day I played They Might Be Giants in my office. “Birdhouse in your Soul” and that girl walked into my office knowing all the words and singing and dancing. I suddenly became very jealous of They Might Be Giants and I thought, “Those guys made it and they did it. Why can’t I do that?” And I felt horrible and it all came back to me. I started thinking, “I gave up. Why did I give up?” And then I was sitting in the front office… I would always stay late at work because my boss was kind of a cult leader. We’d all gather around him at night and listen to crazy stuff. Kind of a Frank Zappa of telemarketing. I was sitting there and I was reading Joe Girard’s “How to Sell Anything to Anyone.” And I looked down and I was feeling horrible and I looked down at the title of the book and suddenly it connected and I looked at the secretary and said, “I just wrote my new album. You don’t realize it, but I just wrote my new album. That’s it.” And it all came to me. I always have those flashes of inspiration that would set me off in some huge direction and I just knew it. The next three years were spent working on How to Sell…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: And you came out to California…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: Yeah. I moved out to California for a little while because, actually, I wanted to befriend Trey Spruance. I moved to California to San Francisco, found him, got a hold of him, he reciprocated and wanted to hang out with me. He’d come over and pick me up and we’d go around the city and he would try to explain… He was a lecturer. He would lecture me for hours, he was like a professor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: All those Mr. Bungle guys are pretty academic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: Yeah. I think this guy in particular should have been a college professor instead of trying to be a professional musician because I realized after hanging out with him—I think I realized after driving around for 5 or 6 hours with him just talking non-stop, I looked over at him and thought, “Oh my God, this guy could die right now in the car and nobody would realize. I hope nothing happens to this guy because he’s so special and a genius. I can’t believe I’m in the car with this person right now.” I looked up to him so much in that moment. I was like, “Wow, I’m with Frank Zappa,” or someone like that. An enlightened being somehow. He told me all about the tarot and about all of these things. I went home and I was just mind-blown from this experience. I really looked up to him a lot and realized that any music he does or Mr. Bungle fame or any Secret Chiefs thing, that’s nothing compared to that human being walking around. He’s just doing that for fun or something. That’s nothing compared to hanging out with him. I don’t know how much of that was charm and manipulation at that time, or if he was just a magnetic personality. Getting older, thinking about that, I think, “I wonder how impressionable I was.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: You were so poor then, too. You had no money. I sent you $10 or something and you were like, “Wow, this really helps,” and I was like, “It’s just $10.” You were SUPER appreciative and you were like, “I’m going to be able to eat for the next day or two.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: Yeah, friends used to send me boxes of food and stuff like that. I just couldn’t get a job in San Francisco and it was not going well. But you actually told me while I was out there working on “How to Sell,” you said, “If you finish the first CD, I’ll play it for Steve Vai.” [I was working for Steve Vai at the time.] And I was just like, “Okay.” And I just locked myself up and worked until I finished the first disc and then I overnighted it to you. That was huge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Not that I want to get involved in the story…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: Yeah. Well, you’ve been a big part of my story, but whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: What happened then? You overnighted the CD, I got it in front of Steve, and then?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: Well, I think I woke up to an email from Steve. I went and checked my email and there it was. An email from Steve Vai. In the “from” thing. There I was. I’ve made it! I completed the path that I wanted to go on. And he liked the record. And you told me his reactions and things like that. I felt like that was the greatest moment of my career. That was so big to me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: And then he posted some of your music on his Favored Nations web store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: Yeah, he started selling the Yasmine Bleeth CD on there. I took screenshots and I thought, I actually thought that I was about to get famous. I told someone—I actually got a job at Guitar Center for some time and I told everybody that I was Carl because I didn’t want anyone to know that I was Sir Millard Mulch. At that point I found out that I needed to keep the music separate because people didn’t like Sir Millard Mulch. And so if someone knew, they would fire me or something and hate me. So, then I was embarrassed about being Sir Millard Mulch for some time. Then I told a guy at the music store and I was like, “Hey I want to tell you something that I’m not telling anybody, but I’m actually Sir Millard Mulch.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Did he know who that was?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: He was like, “Oh. I don’t… What does that mean?” I was like, “Well, you might not know this but Steve Vai is probably going to put out my next record on his label.” And he was like, “No shit, man!” I was like, “Yeah, I actually play guitar.” He was like, “Wow! That… That’s amazing.” Kind of a stupid conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Did that help your career?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: It did. I was able to go up to Virgil Donati at a clinic. It gave me confidence. I didn’t overly boast about it, but it made me feel legitimate, like I not have been validated or verified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Your “weird art consequential!” [Lyrics from one of Carl’s songs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: Yeah yeah yeah yeah. Like someone thought it was real, not only me. Someone I kinda worshiped thought I was valid. So I was able to use that, like “Here’s my membership card.” So I could work out deals with people. “Hey Virgil, I’m Sir Millard Mulch.” I think he did something with Favored Nations somehow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: He was Steve’s drummer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: Yeah yeah yeah. And I was able to go up to him and say, “Hey, I’m putting out a record on Favored Nations and I’d like to hire you for some drumming.” I was able to be very professional for the first time. And he was like, “Oh, yeah. Email me. Whatever.” So that was able to happen because of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Now, How to Sell is kind of your magnum opus. Started as a 3-CD set with 2 real CDs and a 3rd blank CD, and it ended up being 4 CDs-worth of material. So it evolved over some time, but so much personality, such a sarcastic stance on sales and marketing and all sorts of stuff. I feel like that became a very personal record for you only because it was a consistent theme that you were so passionate about that you had to write 4 CDs worth of material and follow it up with a 200-some page book and all sorts of other material. It informed your graphic design style for your website. For me, it was like, when Sir Millard Mulch started making his mark. Can you talk about the impact of that record on you? And who were some of the people you got to play on it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: I don’t know. That’s a lot of information. I’d like to address the manipulation aspect of it because I was working at the ad agency and I saw people around me making $100,000 a year talking on the phone selling advertisements that were worthless. That people would get no return on and there were all these techniques to get the correct decision-maker on the phone and manipulate them into buying ad space in totally worthless publications in terms of return on investment. Worthless. And we all knew that at the company and we would even use that sometimes in our pitch and still get away with selling massive amounts of advertising. The president of the company was very wealthy and as I said before he was kind of a cult leader to all of us because we all thought it was incredible. He never hired people who were A-players. He never hired someone who seemed like a good match. He would pick these weird talents out of people. Really messed-up manipulative people, like criminal manipulators. Gamblers, cheaters, like that, and bring them in and manage them and put them in these different rooms and move them around in order to control them and rake in cash. I had a discussion one night with him at Applebee’s with him. I said, “I don’t know how I feel morally about the company. It weirds me out that people are paying all this money and they’re not getting any return and we’re making money off it.” And he said, “Well, look at it this way: Who is it hurting? Number 1, we’re raising funds and sending it to our clients that are contracting with us to raise the money. We’re basically fund raising. And you get paid to do the graphic design, our sales people make money, the client makes money, the advertisers feel good that they’re contributing something to help with a project. In the end, everybody wins. These are major corporations that are spending the money. Not people. We’re not stealing the money from anybody. We’re taking money out of a giant company, Microsoft or whatever. This is tiny money compared to what they’re spending everywhere else.” And so I thought, “That’s an interesting argument. I guess I can accept that.” And it took me to a dark place because I always felt like such a goody-goody. Just this pure moral kid who never did any drugs and never stole anything, except for a page in a magazine with a picture of Steve Vai. I tore it out and shoplifted and I didn’t have that picture and I needed to complete the wall of Steve Vai pictures. Anyway, I started really questioning myself and started testing some of my morality by going to strip clubs and doing things I shouldn’t be doing. It was kind of a breaking myself down and challenging my own beliefs. I started getting involved with girls I shouldn’t get involved with, started lying to people, started kind of cheating in ways of manipulating people that I knew. Started thinking, “Oh, now I kind of know how to do this. I should see what happens if I do it.” And I’d go through phases where I was like, “No! I can’t do that! Why am I thinking these things? I’m such a bad person.” I never did anything criminal or anything, but I would just make someone think I liked them or something like that as an exercise. I don’t know where to go from there. I just got really into that and it really messed me up and really changed me. I specifically know that I bring certain people onto the record just so I could use their name just to sell more records. Sometimes they would contribute nothing useful to the record, but I would figure out a way just so I could get more names on it and make it ridiculous. Let’s make it look like the drummer from Good Charlotte’s on the album. Then I could go out with my CD and say, “Oh, you like Cannibal Corpse? The drummer from Cannibal Corpse is on my album.” “Really?! Wow! How did you do that?” It was such a local story that I could sell the stuff. I’d go out and sell my CDs to people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So a lot of your music…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: But that’s not about music. You want to talk about making weird music. It was such a big thing for me. It was a personal adventure in manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Well, it was a big motivator, in a weird way, to make that weird music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: And the music was completely secondary. By that point I was just churning out music according to my formulas. It was very easy for me to make that music. The challenging thing was conceptually with the lyrics and titles and feeling like I said the things that I was experiencing while going through that process of trying to reconcile being creative and pure and being a manipulator who wanted to survive and become famous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: On this album, there’s a lot of what you’ve called “pointillism.” It’s like the start of that type of music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: I did that way before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I know you did…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: But I didn’t do anything new in that that I hadn’t done in ‘96 or ‘95.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: It seemed like you were…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: It was like 10 years later. Maybe people started noticing it 10 years later, but I was already angry by that point because it had already been 10 years since I had done all that stuff. So I was bitter that people finally liked How to Sell because I put all these big names on it and then I was mad. “Oh, see you fucking idiots? Now you’re listening to it, but it’s actually I’ve already been doing this and you’ve been rejecting me all these years.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: The “pointillism” aspect. Dr. Zoltan ended up consuming, replacing the Sir Millard Mulch character. Dr. Zoltan was far more opinionated, far more iconoclastic, trolling the internet, making videos saying “Rage Against the Machine sucks and if you like them, you’re an idiot.” Super-opininated. The music was very in-your-face in terms of pointillism and the lyrical content and not nearly as friendly as the Sir Millard Mulch stuff was, or at least not as happy. What happened there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: Well, I guess the smallest part of my story is the music. The bigger part was always the psychological problems and my anger. The Zoltan videos were masked attacks on my girlfriend at the time. In some ways I really hated her. And I hated LA. And I was mad at her for not understanding me. And so I would release that anger pretending that I was talking about Tool, but actually I was talking about her. I found a Tool CD in her car and I was like, “Oh, this is not good.” So then I would go home. She would drop me off at my shitty house room that I lived in in Culver City and I’d go in the backyard with my computer and would just write this angry thing about Tool, but it was really a letter to her. I released it to the internet and all these Tool fans would get angry, but I knew nothing about Tool. I didn’t really like them, but I didn’t really care, but it was really—if you just go back and replace the word Tool with her name, just completely making fun of her. I don’t know how conscious… there was a dark side of me that was doing this on purpose, but I was able to shift my mind and say, “Oh, I’m just making fun of Tool.” I was very conflicted, but I was really angry at that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Were people aware that Sir Millard Mulch guy that they were following musically, purchased CDs, whatever… Had stopped to exist and there was this new guy in his place? In marketing terms, “Oh, you’ve pivoted your brand” or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: Yeah, nobody liked it. Everybody thought I was an idiot for doing that. I don’t think anybody supported me changing my name. They were like, “What are you doing? That’s just stupid. It’s not even a good name.” And I started making these dumb videos making fun of bands and churning up all this anger on YouTube. It had nothing to do with what I was doing before. And I hated it and everybody else hated it. But I was convinced this was the way to go. “I have to follow this. This is where this is going. This is where the inspiration is taking me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: And you ended up releasing an album before the “Why I Am So Wise…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: Yeah, but it was only a bunch of Sir Millard Mulch songs, but I called it Dr. Zoltan. And I had Steve Cox go through and add orchestra and I remixed it and re-recorded a bunch of guitars, erased the vocals…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So then you got to “Why I Am So Wise, Why I Am So Clever, And Why I Write Such Good Songs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: Which is a Nietzsche reference from Ecce Homo. It’s in that book, towards the end of his life when he was losing his mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Musically, it’s very intense. It seems more focused. You dropped the “skits” aspect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: However, there were supposed to be skits. I never recorded them. We can talk about that, I don’t know if anyone knows about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A:  I’m just thinking, Zoltan… I particularly enjoy that album, much more than any of the Mulch stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: The Zoltan?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Oh yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: Okay. You’re the only person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Probably. But, I feel like you were growing musically, going through emotional changes, and your music got weirder and more pointillistic. Can you talk about what this pointillism thing is and what you were going for musically with Zoltan? Did you expect it to succeed in any way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: I have to go back to the psychology again because that’s what it all came from. It was so rarely about music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Some people are motivated by a lyric, some by a melody or a chord progression. For you, it’s psychology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: And my emotional problems. I remember telling my friend Dale [Lewis] that I make my music out of anger and it all comes from anger. He said, “I don’t believe that, Carl. I think music is more to you than that and I think you can make your music without anger.” And I thought, “Wow, he’s kind of challenging me. I wonder if I can do it.” And around that time, I moved to LA. John La Grou also wanted me to make purely beautiful music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: The founder of Millennia audio?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: That’s right. And he believed in me and he funded it and let me stay at his house for a month and work in his studio and use all his guitars and equipment. He bought me gear and backed the whole thing. Like, “All right, Carl. Let’s get you out of Florida, away from the bad influences. Bring you up here to this paradise up here. Here, do anything you want. I’ll take care of you. You make this giant album you want to make that’s beautiful music.” I was like, “All right, I’ll do it.” And got there and was completely blocked for the first time in my life and could not write anything. And just struggled and was depressed and felt horrible and started wandering around and crying and walking down the street in his neighborhood with tears in my eyes. “It’s gone, I can’t write anymore.” Because I was trying not to do it from an angry place. And I really fought my way through it. I got the Prokofiev thing recorded and I was like, “But I didn’t even write this. I’m just hacking through this other person’s music. It’s just not working. It’s not flowing at all. This is wrong. It’s horrible.” Where did you want me to go from there? Oh, the pointillism. Yeah, I was attempting to do an instrumental album where the sky is the limit. “Here it is Carl. Do anything. We’ll even buy you more computers that have orchestra instrumentation and can do the whole thing in 5.1. Got a lot of preamps and microphones. Anything you want. Here’s a big studio with anything.” And I just collapsed. It didn’t work. I spent a whole month and got, like, 3 or 4 things recorded. I did the Bartok thing, the Prokofiev thing, and recorded the Warthog thing there, I think, and some other little bits of nothingness. It was a horrible failure for me to spend a whole month and only get that done. And, but yeah, my point was I wanted to finally explode musically and prove what I could do with music. Without the anger I couldn’t do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So what is the pointillism stuff?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: Pointillism stuff is… The same way you look into the stars and see constellations. They’re not necessarily a scorpion, it’s just dots around the shape of the scorpion. So, connect the shape of the dots. So I would have an underlying hidden rhythm that’s there but I would then write around that hidden rhythm so it would only hint at the actual rhythm of the concept that’s happening underneath it. But, that concept was not there. So, it’s kind of like re-harmonizing the melody, but you mute the melody. And it’s missing. So your mind has to then piece it together. And it sounded really jerky and weird to me and it was fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So that’s why there are 15-20 tracks that are 20-90 seconds long and they’re all super pointillistic? But it was hard for you to evolve those ideas because you muted the melody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: Well, I wasn’t literally muting the melody, but conceptually. I would get going on something and thing, “Here’s 20 seconds.” And then I’d be like, “I don’t know what to do.” So it would just end. That sucks. It didn’t have a B section or any other ideas and it would just stop. And I did that over and over trying to come up with something and I just couldn’t get it going. “Well, there’s another thing I couldn’t go anywhere with.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Was there any success with that record?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: No, it was terrible. As far as the reaction… Very little reaction. People still talk about “How to Sell” all the time, which is fine. I don’t have any problem with that. That album, I printed 100 copies at DiscMakers for like $300 and I gave 50 of them away at NAMM at the Drumkit from Hell Toontrack booth and the other 50 I haven’t even sold all of them. It was a financial…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Boondoggle?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: Yeah. And I was surprised actually that there wasn’t someone, as Zeke was saying, there wasn’t someone who championed it. Without all the big names and manipulation shit and advertising and tricks and social media, it just sat there. Nobody really listened to it and I’m surprised that people like Tony Levin aren’t out there… when they ask Tony Levin, “What are you listening to lately?” “Oh, I found this Dr. Zoltan thing that really did these crazy rhythms.” Nobody has said that except for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: And Andy West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: Yeah, I don’t even know him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: For many years you tried to be a musician. A weird musician. You had some progress actually selling stuff, making some sort of a living supporting yourself while also being a musician.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: And I thought that after “How to Sell” I was set. “Now it’s going to exponentially get bigger and I’m going to be set after this. I’ve made it.” I reached the level of success that I wanted and I thought, “I can now be a Primus or a Mr. Bungle at the next step and that’s where I’m going.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: What are your influences? I know you don’t listen to very much now, but who have been some of your major influences and what do you listen for in terms of music that appeals to you? You still sell music on your site, things you find interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: So, we’re talking present time? Present time, I don’t actively listen to any music. The only part music has in my life is if I’m editing some video and I have to put music in the background. And I’m pretty good at that I think, but I will listen to a little bit of classical music in the car at low volume. I’ll turn it up if I hear some Chopin and piano stuff or anything that catches my ear in a way that I don’t immediately understand because I feel like I understand music too quickly and it just sounds like a formula for me. And I’m like, “There’s the fucking formula again.” I don’t want to hear it because I immediately understand all of it. So anything I don’t immediately understand, it feels like it’s farther away. It feels more alive because it’s not a robot. Does that make sense? It’s mysterious to me. If there’s a little bit of mystery, it’s more real and magical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: You work with a lot of musicians, many of them are full-time, they have some level of success of notoriety. Guys like Thomas Lang or Morgan Agren, they can play drums and that’s what they do and they pay for their house… So you have a lot experience with people working in the music industry. If someone were to come to you and say, “I’m thinking of becoming a full-time musician,” would you have any advice? Especially if they were making nonstandard music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: Well, I think if you want to do it, you can do it. I mean as far as making the music, you can definitely do that. But, you really have to understand that it’s very possible that no one will give a shit at all. And on a very deep level. Not just saying that. You can’t just say, “Oh nobody’s going to care.” You really have to know, “I’m building a bunch of furniture in my garage that no one else is going to see and I’m going to stuff it in boxes and keep it in my garage. It’s really the same. Or, I’m cooking a bunch of food and I’m going to just throw it in the trash. You’re literally just doing that. Maybe someday someone will walk by and smell you cooking and think that you’re good, but for the most part, when I get emails from kids asking me what they should do, I’m like, “Look, realistically, even all these people that you think are successful, they’re really struggling. People with big names who you think have succeeded in making their weird music. Unless they’re constantly touring and you see giant concerts full of people cheering and buying stuff, they’re probably nobodies when they’re walking down the street and they’re living in an apartment that’s a fucking shitty dump with nothing and they live month to month and it’s not a pleasant lifestyle and a lot of people do that. They come out to LA and they do one $250 job to the next. And they, once a year, get a feature in a drum magazine or something and you think, “Oh this is this world-famous person,” but no, they’re playing up at the bar at the corner for 20 people on a daily or monthly basis. So there’s wayyy too much expectation to be able to live off music in general. And then weird music on top of that, like, “Good luck!” Even these people like Morgan Agren are struggling and he’s barely making it for all these years. So, it’s not a … You can try to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: In terms of your composition style, I’ve always been fascinated at your ability to play with rhythms and to come up with parts, drum parts or strange melodies. What gets you started? What’s your method? Do you sit at a computer and then you start putting in notes on the score or in the piano view or do you play a guitar?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: The formula for “How to Sell” was: I had a TextEdit document on my Mac that I would fill with song titles. It was all with song titles. It was the most important thing to me. I would say, if I wrote down 5 song titles that day I would consider that I wrote 5 songs because then it was just a matter of following my formula I’ve had for 10 years and knock out 2 songs a day, usually. “Today, it’s 2 o’clock. I could have another couple songs done by 7PM. If I have those song titles to go on.” So, song title. Then I would write the lyrics. And they were always, almost always the same rhythm. DUH-duh DUH-duh DUH-duh DUH-duh DUH-duh DUH-duh DUH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: “But for now I’m just a flaky artist down the street.” “Help me buy some food so I can say I’m in the industry.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: It was always that. I don’t remember what that’s called. Is it iambic pentameter? But yeah, that’s what I did. Over and over and over again. You could just switch the lyrics all around between any song, pretty much. Unless Ian wrote the lyrics, which he did for many songs on “How to Sell.” So then I had the lyrics and I would sit there with a guitar and strum major chords and write the melody and I’d say, “Oh, there it is.” I’d usually throw that down on a quicktime file and record myself humming and strumming so I wouldn’t forget it 5 minutes later because I wrote it so fast and then I’d go start programming it into Cubase with a 4-note chord, like blocks of whole notes with 4-part harmony. Keyboard part and stick the melody on top of that. I’d have the keyboard part with 4-note voice chords and a melody on top of it and then I’d have the template for verse, chorus, bridge and I’d go through and start putting the bass line in. And the bass line is completely fucked and all over the place. And just at random, changing the tuples, and I wouldn’t even listen to it. Click click click click. “Does it sound okay?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So, it’s not even intentional?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: No. And then there would be a spot and I’d say, “Eh, I’ll move that beat over there. Does that sound good? Okay.” Start programming drums. Program the fucked up drum beat. “Does that sound good? Oh, I like how that happened. That’s funny.” Now start filling it in with recording my actual bass and guitar playing that bass part. Then I’d add some rhythm guitar up high, some clean guitar, and then I’d go through and change the piano part to a keyboard part, maybe change the rhythm of that, background vocals, weird sound effects, “Oh this part sounds thin,” add myself coughing in the background, something. And there was very little thought and it was very fast. I’d do that over and over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So even a complex piece like “Chariots of the Sales Gods…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: In those parts, whenever a guitar part was too fast, I’d slow the part down and speed it back up in Cubase so I could actually play it. So I’d play it at half speed one beat or measure at a time until it’s perfect, then stop, next measure, then speed it all up. And the time compression in Cubase was really good, so it sounded decent to normal. So everything was played very precisely until I got it exactly right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: And then copy paste when you needed to hear it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Very interesting. Thank you so much for your time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;C: Fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Okay, bye.&lt;/p&gt;
