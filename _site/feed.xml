&lt;p&gt;PODCAST AUDIO COMING SOON!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interview-transcript&quot;&gt;Interview transcript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;Anthony: This is Anthony from MakeWeirdMusic.com and I am here with Ben Levin. Unless it’s “Le-VIN…” Is it “LE-vin?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Ben: No, “LE-vin” is good. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: All right, cool. Ben Levin from &lt;a href=&quot;http://bentkneemusic.com&quot;&gt;Bent Knee&lt;/a&gt;. Ben, I have been listening to your music in Bent Knee and your solo music. It’s pretty incredible stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I was wondering if you could introduce yourself. Tell us a little about yourself. Take as much time as you want and say as much as you feel is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: Okay. Hello, I am Ben Levin. I’m a musician. I make a lot of concept albums and really over-the-top music, but it’s always about little human things. I like telling stories with music and I like playing guitar. My favorite thing with music is making albums and writing then recording music. I think that’s the thing that is the most enjoyable aspect of life so far (outside of the love with humans thing, that’s pretty good too).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Let’s see… I am based in Boston and here I perform in a number of groups, mostly with the same people in those groups, but in different configurations. My pals who play in those groups and I have this collective called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.secretdogbrigade.com&quot;&gt;Secret Dog Brigade&lt;/a&gt; in which you find Bent Knee, &lt;a href=&quot;http://benlevingroup.com&quot;&gt;Ben Levin Group&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.secretdogbrigade.com/justice-cow/&quot;&gt;Justice Cow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.secretdogbrigade.com/mr-gavins-meat-farm/&quot;&gt;Mr. Gavin’s Meat Farm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.secretdogbrigade.com/that-one-eyed-kid/&quot;&gt;That One Eyed Kid&lt;/a&gt;, my solo stuff, and then &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.courtneyswain.com&quot;&gt;Courtney Swain&lt;/a&gt; (the singer from Bent Knee)’s solo stuff. And everyone else’s solo stuff as it comes up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I play in all those bands even though they’re mostly comprised of the same 8 or so people. It keeps me pretty busy and I teach music lessons on Skype. I have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/c/benlevin&quot;&gt;a YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; and I make instructional videos as well as music videos. Private videos are just stupid running around and screaming. I’ve got about a dozen of those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Are those creatively done or are they more improvisational?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: Oh, that’s a good question. Well, they’re usually outtakes that I enjoy that I keep from when I’m trying to do something serious. Before I start filming an instructional video, when you’re making an instructional video or anything that you’re going to put on YouTube, I have no idea who I’m actually talking to and there’s so many ways to interpret a person, so I think one of the safest ways to be inclusive when you’re making a video is to be happy just because, as long as you’re genuinely having fun, people can see that and at least they understand that you’re not resentful of the moment that you’re trying to bring them into. It’s more fun to be in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/7gwyVnft0OY&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, before I start recording, I’ll often be like HA-BLEE-DOO-LA-HOOGLAH-HEYGLUH-HOGLAH-HUNGAH! Or I’ll scream profanity or I’ll make up funny little phrases that are usually not too offensive, but it’s hard to think of one. They just kind of come. So, that gets caught on camera and then sometimes I think it’s funny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So it sets the mood?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: Yeah! And then I have a bunch of private videos that are old trailers for shows that I made when I was in college for concerts where I would be in college acting like a guy in college. Not that interesting to anyone except for my anymore. So, they’re there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Why so many bands at one time? What’s the purpose of having 8 separate groups with the same people?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: Well, that’s a great question. I know it’s kind of weird because it’s the same people. Everybody wants to be on our team, but everyone also wants to do their own thing. You can’t really sustainably hire people to play your music when you don’t make any money playing that music and you can’t have 8 bands succeed at once. Maybe someone could, but it seems like such a terrible gamble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, because there’s no way to get your music played by musicians and pay them, a better thing is to trade where it’s like I’ll play all of your songs, I’ll do whatever you want, and you play on my songs and you do whatever I want, and we’ll be in this band where we’ll collaborate, too. So everyone gets fulfilled in that way. Whoever’s got their own kind of path and music that they really want to try, gets a chance. And then, for Bent Knee in particular, it makes it so that when we’re in there, we’re much more easier to be democratic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;There’s a lot less conflict because we’ve all got some way of satisfying our own very nit-picky and control freak types of ideas. It creates a window for compromise. It’s sort of like an economy of creativity where I have the stuff I do absolutely by myself, it’s like life [inaudible]. I’ve done that a few times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Then I’ve got Ben Levin Group, which is music that I write, but ultimately I give an incredible amount of final say and power to everyone in the band, so it’s still pretty egocentric for me and pretty satisfying with “I can write the music and other people play it,” but there is a level of dependence, especially with the producer, Vince, who’s also in Bent Knee. He mixes all the Ben Levin Group stuff and produces it. It’s really a big, collaborative thing, even though it’s got my name on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;And then Bent Knee is the ultimately democratic musical experience where everybody is equally involved in the music and the band is very familial in that way. There’s no leader. So, that’s the advantage of many bands with the same people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/9s7XwPw4Ie4&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BAD EDIT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: That’s great. How did you guys initially get together?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: We mostly met at &lt;a href=&quot;http://berklee.edu&quot;&gt;Berklee College of Music&lt;/a&gt;. I’m in this band, That One-Eyed Kid, with someone I went to high school with. His name is Josh Friedman and he literally has one eye and that’s why the band’s called that. You’ll see him in a lot of my videos playing with me. I’ve been playing with him for a long time and then it made sense that when I went to college in Boston, I went to Berklee and he went to BU, and so we continued playing together and he’s been in Ben Levin Group since its second year. It formed in 2007 and he’s been in it since 2008 and we were in bands throughout high school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Everyone else I met through Berklee, pretty much. We all kind of started in Ben Levin Group to some capacity, like the violinist from Bent Knee, Chris and I met through Ben Levin Group. Courtney saw us at a Ben Levin Group show and then we started collaborating Bent Knee from that. Josh, the one-eyed kid guy, he’s in Ben Levin Group. Gavin, the drummer in Bent Knee, in Ben Levin Group. Just a lot of people. Everyone had something to do with the Ben Levin Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, that was sort of the beginning, but you can’t… Having the Ben Levin Group is like a composing studio group thing and it’s very important to me and it’s a very special space, but it’s very hard to do things by yourself or to always be in charge of everything. It was kind of against the grain for me to truly push that as far as it could because I wanted everyone to always–I wanted people to take on different jobs and help me manage the band and stuff, but I realized that can’t happen if it’s called Ben Levin Group and it’s just my music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I think it’s a maturity thing where you’re able to, at a certain age or a certain level of musical experience, be able to find just as much joy or maybe more in collaborating with others at an equal level than you do bossing them around. And the reason for that, I think, is when you’re in high school and you’re trying to be in a band with people and collaborate, you just fight all the time because everyone’s kind of an idiot. I’m not saying everyone in high school is an idiot, but you’re pretty bad at expressing yourself in a constructive way and being bold enough to say what you mean, but also sensitive enough to say in a constructive way and to take criticism–collaborating in high school is incredibly hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But then collaborating in college is only slightly easier. But then when you graduate from music school, a few years after you graduate, people start getting pretty good at music and pretty good at life, too. They start figuring out who they are for real and then you can start saying, “Hey, I have an idea for this, but this person always has great ideas and they might be better than mine and I actually want to hear them.” That’s why it took me so long to enter a fully collaborative project like Bent Knee and it’s why Ben Levin Group was the first thing that happened because you’ve got a lot of hunger to make albums, but you don’t necessarily trust that everyone’s going to do a great job unless you tell them what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Right. &lt;a href=&quot;/interview/jeff-berlin&quot;&gt;I just interviewed Jeff Berlin&lt;/a&gt; a few weeks ago and he was talking a lot about music education and schools like Berklee. You ended up being a very creative person. Do you feel that your music education or the experience you had at Berklee ended up forming that or just educating it or opening/expanding horizons? All of the above? How did that experience help you as a musician?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: It helped me to be more creative and find my own voice because what happened was at Berklee, it’s sort of like an all-you-can-eat buffet of every kind of musical style, but there’s not enough time to really get 100% amazing authentic experience out of any one of them. So, unlike other music schools, where I think you can be completely focused on classical or jazz or one thing like that, and then become a true expert at that one field, I think Berklee’s advantage is it gives people a chance to try everything and get pretty good at everything. There are people who get great at one thing there, too, but I think generally speaking, it’s a lot more of an experimental school to go to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;You try things out a lot. What that does is, because you’re surrounded by musicians and because you can try any kind of music you want at any time any semester, you get burned out on–well, not burned out, but you go through the process of trying and forming opinions about directions very quickly. So, I think it might have taken me maybe twice as long to discover that I even cared about bluegrass if I hadn’t gone to a place that provides bluegrass and metal because I wouldn’t have gotten my metal kick properly fed. I really wanted to learn some metal, that was there. I wanted to learn some jazz, that was there. I wanted to learn some bluegrass and that was there. I wanted to learn Middle Eastern music and that was there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/KBZRhlrPnTQ&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And so this whole phase of just figuring out what I like and trying things was accelerated that way and I don’t think it ever truly ends, but what happens is I think when you’re in music school you make music that’s about learning music. So, I’m interested in this style and I want to make music in this style and so you try it. People do this all the time. It’s like, “Oh, I really like Michael Jackson, I want to make pop like he does.” So, you try to make a bluegrass song and, “What if I try to mix bluegrass with jazz?” Everyone does that! Mix this and mix that and mix this and mix that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And then you just sorta do it and then, for me, I didn’t want my music to be about learning music anymore because I got through that. Then music started being about more of a dialogue with the audience and with expressing things that are true in my life rather than making kind of meta-music about the things I’m learning inspired by the things I’m learning. I’m more inspired by life lessons and–I’ve got an album called &lt;em&gt;Pulse of a Nation&lt;/em&gt;, which is the first time that transition took place where I went from making albums about trying things out to now making albums about my life. That was about the first time I broke up with a serious girlfriend, my grandma died, and these are normal things that happen to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;You end a first relationship, you–and if everything goes according to plan, your grandparents die before you and your parents die before you and it’s a horrible thing. It’s really hard, but everyone goes through it and that’s a really potent place to start writing music, even if it’s instrumental music, it can very clearly be about that and maybe people don’t understand that it is, but they can feel that it means a lot to you. And so I think Berklee helped me get to that point where I could start writing music that was about myself eloquently and also in a way that didn’t only make sense to myself because I had a really big vocabulary of styles, but I wasn’t also just obsessed with showcasing styles. I kind of had gone through that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Can you tell us a little about your influences? Who were the major musicians throughout your musical formation in your life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: Sure, yeah. I started out listening to Rent the musical over and over again on CD player when I was in elementary school. The original Broadway cast recording and I listened to the first disc for, like, a year every night. And I listened to the second disc after that. I listened to that obsessively and I really liked the way the melodies were and everything sounded really cool. I’d been playing piano at the time and so I was starting to be interested in music a little bit when I was in elementary school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But, then when I was in high school, I started getting into bands like Nirvana and Weezer and these really emotional rock bands like System of a Down and stuff. That made me interested in guitar because I had a friend who was playing those songs on guitar and I was like, “Wait, how long have you been playing?” I was like, “You can play professional music after six months?! That’s crazy!!” He was like, “Yeah, whatever.” So then I wanted to play professional music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I wanted to play the music I listened to because on piano I never got good at any of those things I was trying because it just wasn’t the music I was listening to. I didn’t think I could do it. That was the other thing. But, it clicked in my head. It was like, “Oh, I can do this!” The Nirvana tunes and the Weezer tunes, they didn’t seem that hard and I started learning them. And so I was hugely influenced by grunge music and music about feeling pathetic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And then I got into metal, particularly Megadeth for a while because that was my first exposure to that kind of guitar playing, like with Marty Friedman doing so many things. Such a versatile sound palette within just the narrow world of lead playing. They sound as full and rich as a human voice. Got into Led Zeppelin for similar reasons. Then I started being obsessed with Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, and Yngwie Malmsteen because I saw the G3 Live in Denver DVD and that’s when I started thinking I might want to do music for a living because I was so freaked out by Steve Vai in a great way that I learned everything I could about him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I found out he went to music school, he went to Berklee, which I hadn’t heard of, and then I was talking to my parents and I was like, “I think I want to go to music school. I could learn guitar in school.” And they were like, “Yeah, that’d be great.” And I was like, “Wait! So… college could be great! College could be really fun! Having a job could be guitar!” That was a lot from Steve Vai because Steve Vai, his life as far as his career goes, as far as the story of his career, is incredibly optimistic. It’s a really positive story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I’m sure he’s had all kinds of hardship in his personal life, like everyone does, but his career arc is wonderful. It’s like, if you want to see if it’s possible, look at that guy. He went to music school, ends up in Frank Zappa’s band, and then before you know it, he’s in all these big stadium gigs. But then, his greatest music is what got the most attention. He started a solo career that was really crazy and creative and that was like what I wanted to be doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I started making albums on my own in high school. I made four albums or five albums, four that I actually released and they were horrible. Total garbage. I did that all day every day when I wasn’t at school, so I don’t know if I got 10,000 hours from that, but that was enough time to make a lot of mistakes. I just made a lot of horrible music and then when I was in college, I made three or four, and since then I’ve made ten more. It’s my favorite thing to do! So, Steve Vai had a big role in that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And then, after college, I got really big into Sufjan Stevens and I got really big into Nick Cave and Kendrick Lamar is my newest obsession. There’s the Tune-Yards and I like Esperanza Spalding’s new album a lot. You know, my thing shifted and I don’t listen to guitarists anymore, but that was a big thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I would say that Steve Vai had the most influence over my life up to the end of college and then Sufjan Stevens has had the most influence since then. I love the way he can make songs that are completely magical and enthralling and they’re about subjects I wouldn’t otherwise care about, like a whole album about the state of Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I’m from St. Louis, Missouri and Illinois never seemed that interesting and I never bothered to go there. Then he makes that whole state seem like a fascinating character, and it is. It’s a whole state. So much happens in a place and he shows the magic in that, which I think is incredible. And he did that for rodeos and he did that for Michigan state and he did that for artists and he did that for, well it wasn’t that hard to do, but this story of his relationship with his mom, he makes that very tangible. So, that’s kind of what I’m trying to do as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: One thing I found so interesting about your latest solo release is the looseness of time. It’s almost like the album is in a dream state where it’s like there are several drum patterns going on in slightly different tempos and you’re singing or rapping kind of in your own world, but it all comes together, it all falls apart, it all comes together. How did you get into that? Your musical influences up until you mentioned Kendrick Lamar and Sufjan Stevens are pretty straightforward music. They’re unique and interesting, but not so experimental in that sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: I think my process is whatever I’m listening to now in the time when I’m making the album. I just rip it right out and then I screw it up because I don’t have any experience with it and so the way that some hip hop is behind the beat, like particularly the new D’Angelo record or any of the Jay Dillard Disciples, and certain tracks on Kendrick’s album like that–Kendrick’s &lt;em&gt;To Pimp a Butterfly&lt;/em&gt; is the greatest concept album I’ve ever heard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I think it’s just the most amazingly executed album I’ve ever heard. It raised the bar on albums for me tremendously. It really flipped my life. And it’s only been about a year since I first heard it, but it &lt;em&gt;flipped&lt;/em&gt; my whole perspective on time and on what a concept album can do. It was one of the first hip hop albums that I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt;. There are albums I think are really great, but this is an album that I can’t think of any album I love more than it and I think is necessary to use what you like about it in your own music. It’s necessary to have that love for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, the timing, the way they’re behind the beat is very nuanced. It’s the result of a lot of time playing, the music that came before the music they’re playing, there’s a lot of background and subtlety to how that “behind the beat” goes. But when you’re just now finding out about it and pointing at it like a straight line, like, “I’m gonna go behind the beat. NOW.” That creates a much more sort of caricature version of “behind the beat.” I think that by itself would be pretty stupid and pretty intangible, but I mixed it with all the stuff I know well from all the music I’ve already made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, there’s this certain cohesiveness I find. I’m pleased with it and I haven’t heard–not that many people have heard it in the first place–but I haven’t heard anyone complain about that. Actually, your coworker was pretty thrown off by it, but I think it eventually makes sense what it’s for because there’s microtonal melodies–microtonal music is melodies where there’s notes between the notes and they use “out of tune-ness” in a standard definition of what “in tune” is and they bend that and, man, it sounds cool when you do it well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;The same is true in timing. You know how there’s only so many beats? [Beatboxes.] And then it’s like, [beatboxes]. And then it’s like [beatboxes]. And there’s [beatboxes]. These beats just keep popping up, but they always feel different when there’s different humans playing it. So, every human drummer has a different [beatboxes]. Every human drummer has a different one of those. So each time we hear a different human playing it, it is a different beat and for that reason, that inconsistency we get so much fresh energy from different songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;That’s why the same chords can work over and over. It’s always going to be a different sound because it’s different people. So I was exploring that hard, microtonal beats thing. How far can you go out before it sounds “wrong?” I think whenever it went so far out that it sounded wrong, I’d try to make those moments very forcefully disturbing so that I’m using the “wrongness” and any time it felt like it was really in, I’d try to complement it with something beautiful. That’s how that went down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: A lot of software now on computers is very grid-oriented. It doesn’t leave a lot of room for those unknown territories. How do you assemble these kinds of rhythmic shifts and microtonal adjustments in whatever software you’re using when it’s not really a feature that Apple’s gonna build into Logic Pro or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: Yeah, well there’s some stuff that’s really mathematical. Mostly I play the beats in and that’s how I do it. I’m just not that good, so they’re sloppy. A tip for you musicians: If you make something sloppy and then you loop it in a quantized manner so the loop always starts perfectly on the 1, then it is not sloppy anymore. If you take the out of time thing and loop it perfectly, you feel that pulse, you feel that return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, you can play beats in for, like, 15 minutes and then listen to spots that really stand out, cut those and loop those spots. That’s a great start for some really organic, but in-time-out-of-time stuff. That’s something I do that’s pretty feel-oriented. I’ll just play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But then there’s also other tricks, like if you quantize to the quintuplet instead of the triplet or the eighth note and you don’t quantize at 100%, the notes don’t know where to go because you usually are playing or typing them on the triplets or on the 16th, so you’re evenly dividing things by 3s or by 4s or by 2s, but when you quantize to quintuplets, they sort of shift closer to the 5, which could be closer to the early 2 or the late 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;You can write in hi-hat parts and cymbal parts that are hard “out.” They’re &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; quantized to the quintuplet, but not all the way. They’re just not followable by themselves, but then you give a really on-time kick and snare, a perfectly executed kick and snare, and the next thing you have is a loose and dance-able groove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I just think that some people learn music through analytical thought and some people need to jam it and need to hear it and some people need both. Everyone needs a little bit of both for sure, but some people are skewed for sure to the “I need to understand it from an analytical basis” and other people are more skewed to “I just need to absorb it from hearing it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;For me, I think, when I can think about something analytically, then I can actually make it organic because I’m not thinking while I’m doing it anymore. Once I understand the pattern, then I practice the pattern and then it’s no longer thoughtful and then I can skew the pattern in slight ways based on what’s happening around me. And other folks, if they learn the pattern, all they can do is remember the pattern, and think about the patterns inhibiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, I don’t know how a guy like Kendrick Lamar, or like some drummers I’ve played with who just have a really great instinct for the perfect “outness.” I don’t know exactly how they come to know that “outness.” Or if they think of it as “outness” as much as they think of it as how they like beats and that’s it. I know Kendrick Lamar’s a superb musician, so I imagine to some extent, even if it’s not how he does it, he’s probably able to analyze it to some extent. You know, When the snare and kick are really tight, but the bass is really lazy, then you’ve got an awesome thing there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I don’t know how much other musicians think about it as these formulas the way I do. I will say I’m not authentic with it in that I haven’t learned a lot of the grooves that these grooves are coming from in their original context. I’m just doing my own caricature impression of what I’ve heard from this album that changed my life, basically. Yeah, so, that’s how I was thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Guitar is your primary instrument. Correct?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: [Nods.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: There’s not much overt guitar on the album. Is that a constraint you set for yourself?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: I think guitar is a widely overused instrument. I think there’s a pop culture and sexiness to it that was a big reason why so many people started using it and playing it. It’s a super versatile instrument, so if you’re going to play an instrument, that’s one of the best instruments to pick up. There’s lots of stuff to do as a beginner, there’s lots of cool stuff to learn, lots of resources. And then it’s a rabbit hole that goes forever, just like any other instrument, but the initial phase is really rewarding, unlike violin where the starting phase of learning violin is torture. It doesn’t even involve a violin. It’s just practicing bowing in the air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;The first phase of guitar is incredibly satisfying. You can play chords. I can show anyone, little kids, adults, anyone, to play 3 chords in a half hour lesson. They’re not hard to play. These are perfectly executed one-finger chords and they’re chords. There’s no way to say, “Well, that’s just a beginner chord.” It’s a chord. It’s totally legitimate and if you put it through distortion, 8-year-old boys have a life-changing moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Guitar is incredibly prominent as a social thing as a fun instrument to learn. And then everyone who starts a band has them. But, I don’t think they’re treated equally with all the other instruments when people are writing for that reason. I think it’s skewed and I think it shows up just because they’re around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So then you have a lot of bands with two guitarists in it and there’s no reason why there’s two. The net result of there being two guitarists is that you can’t ever hear anything else. Just like there’s drummers who are always riding on the crash cymbal, which totally cuts out the vocals (if there are vocals)… It’s not like these people are consciously deciding to cut the vocals out, they’re just playing this instrument this way and they play it because they’re around and that’s what they’ve got.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I don’t think that’s a bad thing, but when I’m writing music, I’m thinking about instruments pretty democratically. The guitar shows up the amount I think that sound should show up. I’m definitely limited by the fact that I can’t just jump into the studio whenever I want and record a real string quartet or record a live drum and bass section any time I want, but I can do it pretty often because out here in Boston, I know musicians who I can do things for them and they can do things for me and get that trading kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I know those musicians and also there’s a recording studio that’s a non-profit called The Record Co that we do a lot of our recording at where they give a rate that allows me to experiment. So I’m still limited in that I can’t do it all the time, but I’m not as limited as I think I would be in some other scenarios. I just kind of lucked out with Berklee, it was a really lucky thing for me. I was lucky that I could go. I was lucky that when I was there, I actually met the people who I’m playing with now and that they stayed in Boston. And I’m lucky that the record company exists at all and that they are available to me. I’m lucky that everyone in my bands want to go spend a day in a recording studio even though they’ve got lots of work to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But, that was not your question, the question was about my limit of the guitar. But, rambling! That’s one of my strengths! I’m quite good at filling space. And you know what? Filling space, that’s another thing I’m really paranoid about filling space with the guitar. It takes up an incredible amount of range. It takes up a hefty amount of low end, and then an absurd amount of mid, and then if you’re going to mix piano and guitar and the guitarist is going blah blah blah blah blah, there’s gotta be a really compelling reason for those two instruments to be together in that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;There are lots of compelling reasons for that, but they just aren’t as common as, say, drums, bass, and one other thing. Drums and bass will be way more prominent in most of my music because I like beats. There’s more often than not a need for beats. There’s less often a need for a giant space-taking chord machine, which is guitar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Sounds like you think very texturally and sonically, not so much in terms of arrangements like, “Oh, I should have the guitar strumming here and I should have the bass doing this here.” It’s more like filling frequencies and painting kind of musical landscapes. Is that a good characterization?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: I think about arranging or voicing a chord. If you play a power chord on the guitar, it’s just two notes, but the way they are and the way they sound makes a huge sound, even if it’s a clean guitar. Even if it’s an acoustic guitar. The overtones are so deep and everything is so powerful with just those two notes. And most of the same lessons you get from that power chord you can apply to where the bass player is playing on his fretboard and where it lines up on the kick drum because one good thump on the kick drum with one good low F that’s sort of muted can be all the low end you need for the next two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But, similarly, if you take that same kick and line it up with a low F on an electric guitar, you’re in a totally different situation in terms of what else can be in the low end and you’ve still created that low thumpy F. And you can voice your whole arrangement like you would voice one chord on an instrument. So I think of it that way and I also think of it–because I’ve made a lot of crappy albums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I’ve made an astounding amount of crappy albums for my age because people are a lot more careful. I think they make better albums in terms of the number–usually people are too scared to make the investment to make a second crappy album after they’ve made the first one, so it’s usually people who hit a pretty good sound on their first one who make second ones. I mean, that’s not necessarily true, but I just get the feeling that people strike out less than me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I like everything since I made &lt;em&gt;Pulse of a Nation&lt;/em&gt; in 2009, but before that, stuff you can’t really find for the most part, some of it’s still there, but it’s pretty much garbage and a big part of the things I hear that are problems are just poor voicing of instruments. It’s just like, if you have four-part counterpart going on, you have four different things going on, I never really asked &lt;em&gt;why?&lt;/em&gt;. I just thought, “Wouldn’t it be neat to have four things happen at once?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I’m not saying you should question all those ideas, you should definitely try them. But once you do it, the reason why it’s there should be that it sounds good, not necessarily that you really wanted something with four parts in it. And that’s kinda where my mind went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I know Bach does it and I like Bach. He’s interesting. There’s this kind of, “I’m like Bach,” part of your brain that was more dominant before &lt;em&gt;Pulse of a Nation&lt;/em&gt; and then in my most recent work, I’m almost never thinking that way. I think that’s an evolutionary thing. I’ll look back to now and notice a lot of mistakes, but I just can’t notice them yet. I don’t know what mistakes I’m making, but I’m definitely making mistakes. I just can’t point to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s easy to point to, even in &lt;em&gt;Pulse of a Nation&lt;/em&gt; and beyond, these albums I like, I can still point to section by section and say how they could be better and change them. A lot of my music doesn’t sound good live from that time, but it works on a recording because you can cheat, you can double, and you can cut through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: It sounded like a lot of your time is spent teaching guitar lessons on Skype. Is that primarily how you make a living now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: Yeah, that’s basically all the money I’ve made since college. I’m hoping that Bent Knee makes money. I think if I were to spell out my ideal income structure, it would be: make a lot of money from making music and then teach for free and teach sort of philanthropically where I would like to find people who definitely should go to Berklee or somewhere like that, would get a lot out of it, but can’t because the way things are right now–it’s like taking on more than $200,000 in student loans and then it’s really hard to take the kind of risks necessary to have a music career if you’re in that situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s still possible, it can be done, I’ve seen it, but it’s unfair because you definitely get an amazing one-of-a-kind experience at Berklee, but I know if you could just get in a music community and have someone guide you through what Berklee &lt;em&gt;would have&lt;/em&gt; been like, if you got on mentor you pay once a week and you can get in with the community and it’s not the same thing as going there at all, but it’s a different way to get probably the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I know somebody who didn’t go to college at all who’s one of the people I play with all the time, he’s just as good and knowledgable as me and my Berklee pals. He’s self-taught. He was lucky he knew the right questions. He figured out what the right questions were and lots of questions and then he found people who could answer because they see his passion and they answer him. But, it looks like it’s going to be the other way around for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It looks like I’m going to be making a ton of music and, hopefully, continuing to grow in terms of how many people care about it. But, it could be a linear curve, or it could be an exponential curve. If it were a linear curve to my fan-reaching to how many people care over time, we’re talking at least another decade until that’s lucrative and then in that decade, there might not be an industry for just making your own albums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It might be people are making music for VR and they’re making it for video games and they’re making it for meditation and they’re making it for movies and they’re making it… tons of money making music, but I don’t know for sure that making your own albums will always be a source of income. Right now, even if it exists, you shouldn’t put all your chips in that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Touring is the alternative way to make money. If you’re an original band, you can do festivals and get paid a lot, so there’s money out there, but touring is not sustainable. Having gone on 16 tours that were all in a minivan and all sleeping on the ground and all that stuff, I imagine it’d be easier to tour for longer if you were in a nicer accommodation than what we do, but it is not a long-term sustainable income source if you want a family and if you want to be able to get sick and not have it ruin your career. Not have it bankrupt you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Now that’s not going to stop me from doing it, but I’m just saying that I shouldn’t expect that to be my–I should push that as hard as far as I can because of the music and then I should also anticipate other ways that I can turn that into money and I think one of them is: I want to be a famous musician because if I’m a famous musician, I can teach more people. I can reach people in large numbers. Colleges will give me a stage. I’ll be able to do clinics and you can make enough money that way. You can make a living. I think that’d be a beautiful way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I think that for the original music I make is where, morally speaking, people should pay and then for education, we should all pass down the sacred art of music. But, I think that paying teachers is essential and I’m really glad people do pay for education in that the more education you can get online for free, the more people are realizing the value of one-on-one interaction and I’m getting all kinds of students who I think showed up on YouTube searching for lessons expecting to not pay for lessons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;They’re expecting to get everything from YouTube and they found something that really inspired them on my channel and then they want to actually study with me. I think that’s telling of how I’m giving so much for free and it’s my best effort at explaining things, but they still want to sign up, so I don’t think there’s going to be an end for people getting paid for teaching. I wouldn’t want there to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But I’m just saying that if I could have things my way, I would just not have to worry about money with teaching and just do it maybe a little differently. I like my students, though. They’re the people who want to self educate, but ended up paying even though they can’t all afford it as often. They can’t do weekly lessons, some of them, and I really admire that hunger. You were going to get a free lesson and then you decided you got so much out of learning something that you wanted to pay and you weren’t even ever prepared to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I think that’s pretty amazing. I don’t know. I’m happy with things. I just want to make more money so I can do the other things that are important in life. I want a certain level of–I want to be able to help other people by not always needing to depend on my health being perfect and my stuff not being stolen. There’s emergencies and stuff that’s gonna be horrible, it’s gonna shatter things, I wanna have some money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I love your passion for all of these things. I think it’s really admirable and it’s wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: Same to you! I’m really impressed with what you’re doing. Your site looks beautiful and your stuff just comes across as like you really have a huge heart for it and it comes from this deep respect for music. It’s fun to hear and see it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Thanks a lot! That’s really nice of you! I really appreciate that. I have to say, and I think I emailed you about this, I was listening to your latest album and it was so personal that I had to stop listening to it. It was this crazy trip I was driving to Denver overnight, my wife was stuck in a blizzard on her way to the airport and the airport shut down and all this stuff, but on the way there on this 14-hour overnight drive from Phoenix, I was listening and some of the stuff you’re talking about is so personal and relatable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;I just recently delivered a presentation about Make Weird Music to a pretty large audience and I was so wracked by my nerves because it was so personal and I thought, “How did Ben release this music that’s so intimate and so deep and personal in a way that’s almost uncomfortable?” I really related to a lot of the things you were saying about the woman stuck in the infirmary, the old-people home, and the dignity of her humanity. Some of the lyrics in &lt;em&gt;Porn Sucks&lt;/em&gt;–it’s pretty funny, but also you’re like, “Wow, there’s some really insightful stuff.” Tell me about what it takes for you to go to that depth and really bare it all for the sake of music. Is that a struggle for you? Did you really have to overcome anything to get to that point?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: It’s cool. Thanks for asking me that. I’m really glad that the songs connected in that way. Those are really important issues to me. Especially ageism. It’s a word that doesn’t get thrown around that much. It’s sort of like fat jokes. People aren’t that sensitive to how fat people feel about fat jokes–not to get on you about the Suge Knight thing [referring to a joke I shared before we started filming], he’s kind of a dick–but I’m just saying particularly with elderly people. I mean, this is where we’re going. This is us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Elderly people–we &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; elderly people. If we assume everybody dies, then we’re already dead in that that’s like the majority of history as far as we know is going to be us dead. It’s this blip of life. Same is true about the elderly. I think it’s just really sad how they have to take a back seat on life in society. It’s also just really sad how aging looks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s very hard to cope with that reality. It’s very important to me. I think the reason why I write about things so bluntly and the reason why I’m able to do it is because I trust that if I do it in that kind of format, it’s the best chance I have at people seeing it as their own lens of it. Like, seeing it through their own lens rather than through mine because music just makes the human more relatable because I’m just a character in your stereo and you can only assume who I am. You’re really imposing yourself into your idea of me and for that reason, you can understand me better. You can BAD EDIT empathize with what I’m saying. It’s the perfect medium for empathy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I don’t force enough details on you to make you see my story, I just give you enough for you to remember your story and then compare and contrast it to what I’ve given. I kind of feel like that’s my best way of being accepted in these confessions, or whatever they are. With anything that I feel that if I get it out clearly, if I can really say what I feel, other people probably feel that in some way in some part of their mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Like about the porn stuff, I think most people look at porn and I think within a demographic–I don’t know the stats of it–but I think that people look at porn a lot. I also think that when most people finish looking at porn, they don’t like it. I think once a man, particularly because I’m a man, I know how it feels once you ejaculate, you want to turn that thing off as fast as possible and it’s like, suddenly you’re just disgusted with it and it’s just this presence in your room that you’re ashamed of. You go to great discomfort to turn it off as fast as you can. And it’s not like you’re afraid you’re going to get caught of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s because the idea and the sight of it is appalling after you’re done and I think that’s a real telling sign and I think other people can relate to that feeling. I’m just kind of assuming that’s how other people feel when they’re in that position. I don’t know what is or what that’s doing. I have to explore it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I think a good way to explore a thing like that is to publicly describe it the best you can and then see what other people think. And so, you know, people disagree with me on that song and a lot of people agree. I’m still not completely sure what to make of the porn industry because I know there’s so much wrong with it, but people should have a right to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, I don’t really have my mind set on a lot of these things and I just want to–questions and music go really well together. I think answers in music kind of–I can’t think of too many things I would want to write that are telling people the way things are. Hip hop’s a good medium for telling people the way things are. That’s part of why I love &lt;em&gt;To Pimp a Butterfly&lt;/em&gt; is because every track on Kendrick’s album there kind of contradicts the previous one. He’ll tell you the way things are, but then he’ll tell you the opposite in the next track. I think that’s a much more human dialogue kind of feeling than an album–you know, it’s an album where I think you can empathize and see where he’s coming from better at the end of it whereas other albums I’ve heard about racism in America, things like that, social inequality, make me feel sort of alienated like I can never understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;This one didn’t make me feel like I can totally understand, but it made me feel like I can understand where Kendrick’s coming from a little better. It’s like one guy closer to being able to empathize with someone else. If an artist can–I think it’s just a great medium for contradictory statements and for questions and believing both sides and leaving things up in the air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I totally agree. There’s an album called &lt;em&gt;From the Corner to the Block&lt;/em&gt; by the band Galactic and every song has a different rapper. I always just liked the drum parts and there are some good hooks and stuff, but, literally, five years after I bought the album I started listening to the lyrics and I was like, “Oh my goodness! This stuff is profound!” As a guitar player, as a Steve Vai fan, as a Zappa fan, lyrics were always like, “Whatever. They kind of decorate the landscape.” But on this stuff, it’s so deep and so when I was listening to your album, which Andy Alt introduced me to you as some sort of guy who won a Steve Vai guitar competition and I heard your music and I’m like, “What does this guy have to do with Steve Vai?” Yeah, but the lyrics are such an opportunity that I don’t think I will ever breach, but I was very curious if there’s a struggle for you or if it’s just like, “No, this is my venue and this is how I do it and I’m much more comfortable doing this than having a conversation about it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: Yeah, I think it makes it easier to have a conversation about it when you know somebody’s heard the song because it’s harder to judge someone when they’re really opening up. We’re so afraid of being judged when we open up and become vulnerable but I think as the receiver of that opening up, past a certain age it’s really hard to punch that wound or see someone be that vulnerable and take advantage of it and push them. But people out there do that and it’s a risk certainly to open up like that, but it’s better to do it, I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Do your parents hear this music and go, “Wow Ben. I never expected this from you?” As a father myself, I’m like, “What if my kids released music like this?” You know? It’s pretty out there and it’s very–it makes a statement. It is not benign music and it’s jarring and disjointed at times in a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; way. I don’t mean that in a negative way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: Yeah yeah. I appreciate those adjectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: But like you said, you exploit the moments where things don’t work and it really does become an uncomfortable experience at times. And listening to the lyrics, it’s even more uncomfortable. Have people close to you, like your parents or a significant other or siblings or anything, had strong reactions to what you do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: Well, my parents are amazingly understanding. Not just understanding, but if I make something in a song, then they take it really seriously and so, I have an album called &lt;em&gt;Sea Stories&lt;/em&gt; about a sex addict and he’s telling his story to his daughter and she ultimately accepts him for who he is. It’s kind of in the Nick Cave style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s really influenced by the Nick Cave album, &lt;em&gt;Push the Sky Away&lt;/em&gt;. He’s got albums like: “She was a light, I was a match, I was the light that could fire up her snatch.” Lines like that. But, he makes them work. I think that’s really amazing. In &lt;em&gt;Sea Stories&lt;/em&gt;, I have a song called &lt;em&gt;Constellations&lt;/em&gt; and the chorus is like, “Where does Orion keep his belt when he’s humping all those whores. If I was made in God’s image, does he have a thing for whores?” They’ve heard me do this for a while, these kinds of ultra-jarring lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I have an album called &lt;em&gt;Freak Machine&lt;/em&gt; and that was the first time I did that kind of thing. The whole thing is sung by Courtney, the girl from Bent Knee who sings. She sings, “My heart says no but my cock says yes” in the first song and she says it with all her might. My mom was like, “Can’t you say, ‘My heart says no but my &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt; says yes?’” That was the only time I think it ever came up that way, but they immediately, once they heard the finished thing, they understood why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I think they love music too and they love books and they’re in the science and medicine field, so they’re not making music, but they love all that stuff and they understand that’s what part of music’s for. I don’t get crap from them, but this one music video I made for &lt;em&gt;Freak Machine&lt;/em&gt;, in the climax, my pal who stars in it shits out a rainbow and he gets smothered with a pillow that’s a monkey’s head. There’s a bunch of orgy stuff. There’s tons of blood. It’s really gruesome. It’s appropriately gruesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s the right video for that song, but I know a guy who went up to me one time and he was avoiding eye contact with me. I went up to him and I said, “Hi,” because I knew him and I liked him. He was really shy to talk to me and I figured out through the conversation after talking for a while that he saw that video and didn’t understand the story behind it at all and just thought that I was this messed up kind of mean, evil person who would impose this on people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;That was weird because once I told him what it was about–it’s about a guy who shoots himself in the head and he experiences his greatest humiliations and realizes what he’s done as he’s going. It’s about a character so extreme that I hoped other people would be able to look at him and think, “Hey, at least I’m not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; messed up.” It was supposed to cheer some of my friends up who were really lonely. So when I explained the video like that, he was nice to me again and friendly again. That’s only happened that one time, really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Sometimes you give people your best and then they reject you. I think that’s just a necessary piece of taking much-needed risks. Like you talking in front of all those people and sharing what you’re doing and sharing your heart is really valuable because there’s probably a lot of people who want to know how you’re doing what you’re doing. You’ll give them the courage or the little boost they need to go and do what they want to do. And if people are doing what they want to do, that’s great! You can deny them all of your own greatness at their expense because of the few people who reject your best. Or even if it’s lots of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;One thing I always try to remind myself with making weird music is that if I make weird music, or music that is very specific and maybe not widely appealing but you have to have this certain set of interests to like it, the people who like it feel included in an often-exclusionary social world. If you’re the guy who gets beaten up in middle school, you hang out with the other guys who get beaten up and that makes it better. If you’re the only person who likes prog, then you go find prog hangouts and they get really close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;The prog community is really close. The metal community is really close. The hip hop community is really close. A lot of underground music scenes are really strong because people combine. So if you’re making super weird music, there’s this chance that you can reach these people who will really love it who, otherwise, no one is really making music for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;When I made &lt;em&gt;Life in the Back&lt;/em&gt;, before I put it out, I didn’t think anyone would actually like it. It was the first time I ever thought that. I thought people were going to make fun of my rapping and they’re going to think it’s too far and people are going to react like they did with the &lt;em&gt;Freak Machine&lt;/em&gt; video and they’re going to give me crap. It’s actually been more well-received and talked about to me more than most of the things that I do besides Bent Knee. Bent Knee always gets lots of attention because it’s six people working all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I’m glad you picked it up and I have a chance to talk to anybody about it. When I put it out, though, I thought there might be some guy who’s day-to-day ritual is he sits at home and let’s say he’s got diabetes or something. That sucks. Or he has some condition that he can’t run outside and he’s alone, but the one thing he really likes to do is listen to music and this album can be one of the albums that really makes his day worth having.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;That’s always possible and you’d never know if that were the case because: what are the odds of the guy contacting you? Usually that doesn’t happen and you have no idea how many people are actually–maybe the number of views on YouTube or whatever, but you don’t really know how many people in the world are really affected by what you’re doing on the internet. You don’t want to deny those people anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Oh yeah. One thing I love about your album is it’s easy to get lost in and I don’t understand it. I don’t mean thematically. I mean you just do so much stuff on there that makes me think about what I do as a musician and it’s so interesting. It’s so thought-provoking musically. It’s really cool to see someone tip-toe-ing to the edge, but it’s not something like several people I’ve talked to–Like Mattias Eklundh was just saying, “I want to be on the right side of weird.” I think you’re on the edge of the right side of weird. It’s not Rock in Opposition or Henry Cow or something like that, it’s its own music and it still fits within those bounds of “this is really creative and really interesting.” But it’s “outside” enough that makes me think it’s another world that I don’t understand and it’s probably part of the roots in hip hop and my exposure to hip hop is too limited, but there’s only so many hours and so many albums. But I can’t wait to check out some of the albums you’ve mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: I just say Kendrick Lamar’s &lt;em&gt;To Pimp a Butterfly&lt;/em&gt; and then &lt;em&gt;Case Closed&lt;/em&gt;. There’s obviously tons more amazing hip hop, but I just think that is the greatest expression of what I like about it and I want to use what I like. Hear where that all comes from for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Well, I thank you so much for your time. It’s really generous to give me so much of your time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: No problem. I appreciate it. It’s really fun for me and I’m glad that music matters to you. I’d love to be able to say that I can put out an album and I know for sure that a lot of people will care, but I never really know for sure. It’s nice when anyone cares. It’s especially nice when someone who cares so much about music cares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: That’s great, man. I can’t wait to talk to you and Bent Knee about the new album. I have so many thoughts and ideas about where you got influences. I could be totally off, but it’s what I hear when I listen to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;B: You’ll like them. They’re pretty silly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Thank you, Ben!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;B: Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PODCAST AUDIO COMING SOON!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interview-transcript&quot;&gt;Interview transcript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to Russell Muller, a long-time friend and big IA fan, for transcribing this interview. And I normally wouldn’t include the pre-interview content, but Mattias is so funny, I thought it was worth inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Mattias: Hello sir!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;Anthony: Hello, how are you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: I am good. I do live in the Swedish woods though and have crappy internet. You can’t see me, can you? No?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: No, no I can’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Oh, okay okay. If I turn on video, you can only see my ugly face and no sound I guess because we’re very far from… well we have broadband but it’s a mere joke. But it’s good to see you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Well, thank you! Alright, well then I don’t have to record video. I can just do audio. Or I can just put a big picture of you up on my screen. If you want, you can take some pictures of yourself and I can animate them into you talking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: That would be great. I can sort that out. I’ve tried video before and I think audio is tough enough. And I sit very close to the wireless router anyway, but it’s really insanely crappy. We are expecting fiber in a little while but there’s nothing now. It’s just pagan territory. We should be happy for audio. But I’ll make whatever. I can make a stupid animation as well, it’s cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: You know &lt;a href=&quot;/interview/jan-zehrfeld&quot;&gt;Jan Zehrfeld&lt;/a&gt;, he recorded himself with a camcorder and sent me the video files. So if you want to do that, that’s also an option. I don’t know if that’s easy for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/0ClQUP7wRw4?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Well I have all the stuff in my studio and I uh… But I’ll send you some stupid, I can even make an extra video, whatever. And say “uh hey, Make Weird Music promo, whatever” you know, in full tip-top HD. I’ll show my penis, whatever! Anything!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: We can get you, you know you can just move your mouth around and I can just use different shots of small clips of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Absolutely! I promise I’ll get you tons of, uh, I’ll make a dropbox folder and put lots of shit in there, I promise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Excellent!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Very good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Cool! Well, I don’t know if you’ve seen any of the other interviews that I’ve done, but they’re very low-key, very informal. They’re more in-depth conversations about you as a musician, how you write music, those kinds of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Yep, cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So yeah. It doesn’t have to be promotional. We don’t have to plug anything. People seem to just enjoy the casual nature of these conversations. So if that’s cool for you…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Absolutely. Super cool. Tip-top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Alright, great. Then I will just get started. I’ll introduce myself. My camera is over here, you can see me, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Okay so my camera is over here, and you’re on a screen over here. So I’m gonna look at the camera when I’m talking to you, but I won’t really see you… well I won’t see you in general so actually it makes it a lot easier. But I’ll just be looking back and forth occasionally. Hi, this is Anthony with MakeWeirdMusic.com and we have a special guest today with us all the way from Sweden: Mattias Eklundh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Hello! Hello!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Hello, how are you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: I am good. It’s freezing cold today; about -10 degrees Celsius which is, I don’t know Farennheit, it’s pretty cold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Pretty cold is what I think it means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Yes, yes. I have lots of facial hair and lots of hair on my pagan skull to protect me from the evil cold, but I like it. I like winter time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I hear you have quite a mane from the videos I’ve seen. Is it quite bigger now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Shave it off every evening, in the morning it’s back! It’s really strange. I don’t know! Yeah, I have lots of hair everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I’ve also heard someone on Facebook said that there’s a great translation of your name in another language, perhaps Hindi?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Yes, Hindi. Very much. Well the Swedish pronunciation is “ehk-lund” but in India–the first time I toured there for three and a half weeks, it took me 2 weeks to figure out why everybody looked really really strange when I told them my last name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;“What’s wrong, what’s up with you?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;“Don’t you know what ek-lahnd means in Hindi? Ek means ‘one,’ and lahnd is one ‘penis.’ So ‘one-penis’.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And it’s really stupid because, and I’ve said this many times, usually when you play an instrument and you’re gifted and you play that instrument, you are called that instrument. You are Mandolin Srinivas or Kanjeera Selvaganesh, or Bass Guitar Bob. But my name is “Guitar One-Dick” or “Guitar One Penis,” which is not bad. I mean, it could be &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerry_King&quot;&gt;Kerry King &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you know. So, Guitar One Penis! Yes, yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: [laughing] I don’t know if it’s because it’s super early for me or because that story is legitimately that funny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Yes, probably early. [laughing] Well you look good. Yes, oh God. That’s how it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/y-xVVVjdmqw?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So the purpose of the site is to introduce musicians and music enthusiasts to new musicians, new kinds of music. And you certainly do some unique stuff on the guitar, and just musically in terms of production and composition. So I thought it would be really cool if you could introduce yourself and talk about kind of the evolution of your career and what makes you unique as a musician.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Oh boy! That’s a tough one. Well, I am Swedish born, I am 46 years old, I live in the coutryside where nobody can hear you scream. And again everyone drinks diesel in their coffee and if they buy a new refrigerator they bring out the big tractor instead of recycling it and they just make a hole and stuff it in there… it’s got nothing to do with my music but anyway that’s where I live. I like it! The hillbillies, they’re okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But yeah, I’ve been doing this pretty much since I was a sperm and it’s, uh… I knew from the age of 6 that this is what I’m gonna do pretty much, you know? I started to play the drums, and I started to play drums on myself all the time and I drove everybody crazy. I have different parts of my body sound different. So I have a snare belly and, you know, a kick, whatever… breast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So it’s, uhm… this is what I do and I’ve been doing it for quite some time. And I’ve lived on it for I think 28 or 29 years, only my own strange music. And to me, that’s one thing to be able to do what you really want–complete freedom and have nobody else deciding for you. And that’s great. So basically a working day could be a cup of coffee, I take my son to school, take the German shepherds into the woods and, you know, wrack my brain a bit what to do with the day, and the wife makes breakfast and I light the fire. And then I take my strange mad scientist haircut and my strong coffee into the Applehorn studio and make strange music. And it’s a beautiful life. I adore it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And then eventually I travel the planet and spread the Viking diseases and so on. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;But the main thing is I knew that I was going to do when I was a little child, in my teenage years.&lt;/span&gt; I have 4 elder sisters and Mom and Dad tried to, of course, you know, raise them as decent human beings and everything. And of course they failed. And, uh, I was a mistake that fell out of my mom 8 years from my closest sister. And it’s like “Oh good God, it’s a male sex organ! It’s a boy!” So I was spoiled to death in many ways. You know, lots of love and attention, occasional Ace Frehley dolls and all kinds of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So, the thing is, I put in second gear in my mid-teens and I realized that well, I’m going to do this! This is what I’m going to do! So I walked up to Mom and Dad, and we have something “gymnasium” I think… what is it, high school or, well, somewhere in between. And &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I said “I’m gonna quit school and I’m gonna spend 10 hours with my instrument every day. Is that okay?” And they said “Sure!”&lt;/span&gt; “What?! You’re okay with that?” So I hope I am going to be as liberal if my son finds something that he’s REALLY into. You know, “I want to collect stamps! 10 hours every day!” “Ah, yes, of course!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Probably makes more money than a musician.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Yeah, certainly! But again, I was a mistake. So it was like “Yeah, but you’ve been doing the same thing since you were 6 years old anyway so we can’t really stop you. It will backfire in a monumental kind of way. So yes, please do go ahead.” And so I’ve lived on this since, I was 16 at the time when I quit school and I’ve been living on it since I was 19 and only making my strange music. And of course, I’ve had my share of shitty years. But little by little I started to understand the business, how to make decent money from it and how to make the money return to you. Even if it’s really wacky stuff from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I also make slightly more commercial music with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freak_Kitchen&quot;&gt;Freak Kitchen &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, although it has a twist and we try to put various elements lurking. You know, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;it’s not obvious what’s happening but if you want to dig deep you can find south Indian reduction structures in a fairly commercial song or a nasty lyric.&lt;/span&gt; So that’s what I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/MWvFoIVoArA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I try as much as possible to grow my own moustache, as I say. I really want to, ah… &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;if I compose something, for instance, and I feel “this is a decent song” but it doesn’t have the smell of Mattias “IA” Eklundh from Sweden, it doesn’t have that typically “heathen” kind of smell, I really think long and hard to sort of dig out who I am and how to get that through in my music, and how to make it sound like ME.&lt;/span&gt; You know? So that’s what I’ve been doing quite a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Listening back to myself, when I was in my shredding teenage years I was, you know, flabbergasted when I heard &lt;a href=&quot;/interview/steve-vai&quot;&gt;Steve Vai&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yngwie_Malmsteen&quot;&gt;Yngwie Malmsteen &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_MacAlpine&quot;&gt;Tony MacAlpine &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or whatever you know. It’s like “I want to play like that.” And then I realized that, well I have to refine myself–my persona and my playing. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;So listening back I realize there is not a single original note here! All this is somebody else’s! You know, throw it out!&lt;/span&gt; You cannot play an interval that anyone else is doing. So I’ve been really focusing on trying to be me, for better or worse. Sometimes it’s like “Aw shit, this is me as well. But that was bad.” So, but that’s really how it is. That’s pretty much what I’ve been doing all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I had a 3-month kind of part-time job that was terrible. That’s it! Otherwise I provide my family a tip-top life in the Swedish woods where we live and have a good time! God, I talk a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: No, actually, it’s funny… Everyone I interview says that, but the point is to get you to talk a lot. So please talk as much as possible, that’s what people want to hear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Goodie goodie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: So you’re a 19 year old, making a full-time living at that point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Yep!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: You were playing in a metal band I think at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Yeah. I moved to Copenhagen. I was desperate for some kind of action in my teenage life, and I had a band that was going nowhere at the time which was, you know, just my teenage band. But then I had an opportunity to audition for a Danish band called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fate_(band)&quot;&gt;Fate &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. When there was a band called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercyful_Fate&quot;&gt;Merciful Fate &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; featuring &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Diamond&quot;&gt;King Diamond &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with an upside-down cross on his forehead and everything, you know, blah blah blah. And when that split, one band became Fate, which was a pop band. You know, big hair, all that stuff. Kind of 80’s pop stuff. And then the other one became King Diamond which was, you know, satanic diabolical stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And I had an opportunity to… and I didn’t really like Fate the music they did, but they were signed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMI&quot;&gt;EMI &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, they were touring all over the place, and I thought “well, whatever!” As long as I get on with it! So I moved to Copenhagen, I got the gig. 25 other players had sort of auditioned. They played their over-produced demo cassettes, you know. And I thought that everything I had recorded up until that point was utter crap. So &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I brought my guitar instead and just went to the drummer’s place and played a lot in his living room. And they were just, you know “Eh! Tip-top! You got the gig!”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So I basically moved to Copenhagen and learned how to tour and the nasty side of show business. I got to puke in limousines and run naked in Munich, and drag innocent Swiss women up in their hotel room. You know, all kinds of stupid things that you had to do when you’re 19 or 20. And when I turned 21, I said “Well that’s it. I now understand what not to sign when it comes to a contract. I realize that this will make money, this will not make money.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It was a good learning period. And then I moved back to Sweden, and in ‘92 I …[founded]… Freak Kitchen. And that’s it. I’ve been building this strange, I dunno, mausoleum bit-by-bit, you know. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I could have made a thousand decisions along the way if I’d said yes to all the offers and this and that could make me a much, how should I say, you know, a bigger, more famous musician. But the thing is I am in quite good control of my music&lt;/span&gt;, and you can make, again, a nice living if you are, first of all if you adjust to new technology and you are aware of what’s going on, you know. And so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But also, if you [audio drops out] in an honest way and make good music just because you love it and, you know, play it like you mean it. People &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; listen to you. People will pick it up, although it’s a lot of white noise out there and everything is a blur, and there’s overkill. You know I’m a dinosaur. I’ve done this for a million years, you know. So thank God I didn’t start out today. That would have been tricky. I would have to show my penis, just to get some quick attention. I’ll do anything! You know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But yeah, I have a freak following. And they’re everywhere from Indonesia to America to, you know, I don’t know, to Brazil to Norway. And that’s great, because I’ve been doing it for such a long time. I usually say &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I’m like herpes. You know? I’m gone for a while, and then I come back, you know? That’s how it is. I never quite go away. You think you got rid of me? You did not. Dang!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Did growing up in Sweden, listening to primarily American instrumental rock music, was there an effect being in Sweden, being away from a lot of your influences geographically? And in a… I don’t know anything about the Swedish music scene or the music industry there. Could you describe what that was like for you and the kind of challenges or the ways it might have helped?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/_jbsn6VT8ks?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Yeah, I think it helped in many ways that first of all nobody lives in Sweden. We’re 9 million people in a pretty big European country. If you’ve seen it’s really wide stretched, you know. So there are some people who live in Gothenburg and some in Stockholm, which is the capital, but otherwise there’s nobody here. And that’s good. And it’s cold as heck, so you have to stay inside and practice on your &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibson_Flying_V&quot;&gt;Flying V &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And that’s what I did! I looked like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunchback_of_Notre-Dame&quot;&gt;Hunchback of Notre Dame &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; after 10 hours of sitting like that. But I think it was good. And it was really super duper when you managed to get a hold a Guitar Player with a flexi-disc, remember those?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Oh yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: With uh, say a &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/P3zR3htvIsQ&quot;&gt;Steve Vai demo of a Carvin amplifier &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. You know, and you had that little song &lt;em&gt;Blue Powder&lt;/em&gt;. And I would freak out, you know? There was a new &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/frank-zappa&quot;&gt;Frank Zappa&lt;/a&gt; album, I remember when &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_from_Hell&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jazz From Hell&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was released I was standing hours before the store actually opened, and so on…. So I think it really, really helped. There was no Internet, you know? People read magazines. So yeah, I think that being in Sweden helps and there’s lots of great Swedish bands you know, because &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;we practice, we take it quite seriously and there’s nothing else to do. Chop wood! Chop wood and play sweep picking!&lt;/span&gt; That’s it! Stupido, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: No, no, it’s perfectly fine. What are some of the other, um, like, do you know many musicians in Sweden? Do you know almost all of them as a result of being there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Yeah, well I know many. But as my son said the other day, he said, “Dad,” and he’s 8 years old and we were quiet in the car and I was taking him to school and he just looked at me and said “Dad, you don’t really have any friends. You only have fans.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And it’s like, “What do you mean? You’re my friend! And the band, and a few others.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;“Yeah, but they’re not really friends. That’s almost like family, you know? We don’t have any dinners with friends.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;“Yeah, well Dad is traveling a lot and when I’m home I want to be with you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;You know? And so on… So uh, but Sweden is small but I never go clubbing. I never, ever, you know people have to drag me to other bands’ gigs and so on. But we are very much aware of who we are and we know one another but I never hang out. Never ever, because when you travel like crazy, say you visit 28 countries in one year, well… the first thing you do when you want to come home is not to go and watch some live act. I hope I don’t sound arrogant, but I’d rather you know, light a fire, glass of white wine, blu-ray movie, whatever, you know? And then I charge my batteries, and then I travel the planet again and spread my strange music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/GvKFCGqdNeM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: How did you get hooked up with &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/panzerballett&quot;&gt;Panzerballett&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: It’s a good question. I think there was some freaky Zappa-esque kind of festival in Germany where I did a guitar clinic and they performed before. And I thought “What a band! What a band!” You know? Amazing, amazing guys. But I think that Jan Zehrfeld actually wrote me, I can’t remember, but I said when I hear the stuff I adore it. I think they’re really really cool. And um, but I also said that, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;“Hey, you’ve got to work on a few things. You’re just too good to have this anonymous kind of lame jazz-smelling artwork. You need to build something.”&lt;/span&gt; You know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;I met him at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musikmesse_Frankfurt&quot;&gt;Frankfurt Messe &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is, it used to be this big trade show and everything. And we had coffee and I said, “This and this you do right musically, you’re just top notch and insane, and I love you! But this and this is utter shit, you know? Nobody understands what it’s about. You have to have some kind of, if not image, at least some output. Pictures of the band! A logo! A cool record cover! A video! I’d be happy to help out.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Then a few records later we did this &lt;em&gt;Ikea Trauma&lt;/em&gt; kind of thing. Which is, well that’s my &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_Frehley&quot;&gt;Ace Frehley &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; doll! It’s featured in the video! And when my mom actually forgot me at &lt;a href=&quot;http://ikea.com&quot;&gt;Ikea &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and so therefore I don’t like Ikea. And I was a young man you know, and she was so into shopping, checked out and everything, and there I was alone. So, well, she figured out after a while that, “Hey, I’m missing little boy with penis. Where is he?” That’s a lot of penis talk now. I’ll shut up about this, sorry. So anyway, that’s it. I don’t remember how it actually started, but uh, I was invited to Jan’s wedding last year. I couldn’t go though, I was on tour though. But he’s a tip-top chap. A mad genius.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Absolutely. We spent probably 2 and a half hours together doing interviews for this website, and we’ve been emailing each other for quite some time. So I was quite pleased to be able to talk to him about this stuff. Tell me about how the impact of technology. You started 30 years ago or so, and things have changed over time. How has technology affected how you write music and how you recording it, and how you release it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Not super duper much. Of course when we started out it was all tape machines and everything, and now you have… I’m looking at my studio outside, it’s a different house in my garden, and I have goodie goodie equipment there and of course I record digitally. But the process is kind of the same anyway. But I bless today’s technology if used in the right way, so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Of course, you know, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I use the social media stuff as everybody else. But I try not to check it too much. I don’t want to live my life through it&lt;/span&gt;, I’m not going to post pictures of a family vacation in Greece, stuff like that, you know? But on the other hand it’s nice that I can sit in a hotel room after walking around in Kathmandu with my nice HD cam and so on, edit it, and throw it out on YouTube. That’s the beauty of it, you know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But you always have to have something to say. If you have something to say with your music or whatever, you know, then it’s great. But &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I feel today that a lot of people have lost their cool. They post for the sake of posting. They share the most lame stuff, you know?&lt;/span&gt; Stuff that takes away all the magic of following an artist. I don’t want to see your living room. I don’t want to know this stuff. I don’t want to see your bad morning haircut. You have beautiful hair this morning, you washed yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/86iUoBJJISc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: So stuff like that. You have to take it for what it is, as a wonderful tool. And it really is, you know? And I love editing video and making stupid stop-motion animation, and hey I’m gonna buy a new macro lens for my camera, whatever, and go really crazy and do strange LEGO animations and so on. Or put my son in front of the green screen, or my penis in front of the green screen. Sorry, there it went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And that’s great, that’s amazing. But writing a song, I sit with usually my acoustic guitar or my 8 string guitar and noodle around, and then I start working with it. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Even if I see the music in actual waveforms nowadays it’s still the same thing.&lt;/span&gt; Because you can cut and paste, you can edit like crazy but what I try to do as much as possible is learn something from start to finish. Of course you make mistakes, but the listener can tell if it’s all chopped up in a million punch-ins and so on. I like it a little dirty every once in a while, so yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: You sound a lot like Steve Vai and Frank Zappa in terms of maintaining control of your brand, your personal brand, and maintaining control of the business of your music. It sounds like you had kind of an awakening about 30 years ago in terms of the business. What does that look like? Is that a big part of your everyday life? Of is that just something that you’re very attuned to?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: You know my music is kind of out there in many ways. But I remember when I did &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freakkitchen.com/shop/product.php?id=50&quot;&gt;the first Freak Guitar album &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I have done 3 solo records with just guitar music, and nobody believed in it, and I didn’t believe in it. I was really happy to have it released in between two Freak Kitchen records, which is vocal-oriented and so on. It’s a band thing and it has much more commercial potential. And it sold like, it was insane, you know? Southeast Asia picked it up, everybody loved it, and it was recorded in a bathroom on 8 channels, you know? And it generated a lot of money because the money returned to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So I bought myself a house. My wife was smart enough to say, “Hey, this is the time in life where you actually invest in something.” And so on, and so I did. So what I do is, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I want to frame my life with good stuff. I want to have freedom. I don’t want to sit, spend my morning in a traffic jam and so on every day and be miserable.&lt;/span&gt; And so I try as much as possible to shape it up and make sure that I am not signing this piece of paper if I am not super duper aware of what it means in practice, you know. So that’s what I usually do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I spend my days turning things down, and saying “no, no, no, thank you, no, thank you, that was very kind but no.” Because I want to maintain control and I want to make money from my music&lt;/span&gt; because, again, it’s a small planet and I’ve been doing this forever. So people are aware of it. And if it doesn’t, if I’m not super happening in Taiwan, well maybe Turkey is cool then, or Tunisia, or Brazil, you know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So it’s always working somewhere. And there’s always a tour, or a gig, or a clinic, or a hoodie sold or a cap sold because I have a merchandise company as well and so on, you know with organic clothing. And sometimes it’s like “hey, do you want to write a guest column for some magazine, or do you want to do a guest lead here, or so on?” So money comes from different places, but the main thing is it returns to me and I have my own company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But I try to, you know, in order to be creative you should not have to worry about bills, and “oh I have to do this” and so on, you know? So I try as much as possible to be independent, to invest in things. For instance, just building my studio it took me 3 years because I was doing it from the ground and paying along the way from just playing, meanwhile keeping the family afloat and happy and providing food on the table, you know? So it took me 2 years and 7 months but then it was paid for, and it’s mine! You know? No mortgages or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/27561923&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/27561923&quot;&gt;Frank Zappa: Will That Be An Aisle Or A Window? (Cartoon)&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/carlkingdom&quot;&gt;Carl King&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com&quot;&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;And that is also freedom.&lt;/span&gt; You don’t cave in, or sort of drown in bills and monthly expenses, you know? And again it comes back to being creative and free to do whatever I want, because it’s life! Every day counts! That’s really how it is. So the business side is boring and I find it super duper boring to do bookkeeping and invoicing, but it has to be done. And I try to sort of work really super duper intense for an hour, and then really shut it off no matter where I am, and then make music for five hours. So it has to have a balance, you know? Otherwise you will just, again, drown in it you know, so yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: It sounds like there’s no shortage of opportunity for you. How did you go from… was it primarily the first record from Freak Kitchen that made you a big enough name to generate that much work where you’re turning things down on a regular basis? Or has this just been a natural evolution over the last 30 years? What has that been like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: I think it, again, about growing your own moustache.  For instance when I was joining Fate, the early, the Danish band, late ’89 when I was 19 and moved there, I immediately realized that is opportunity to show all my freaky teenage licks when we were doing a major company, you know, record release and everything. So I really grabbed the opportunity to show “this is what I can do!” Of course I overplayed and it was a complete guitar overkill. But the Japanese, they picked it up and they said “Oh this is great! This is a new guitar hero! Blah blah blah!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So when I quit the band I went straight to the Japanese and I said “Hey! You really liked what I did on this previous record? I’m gonna put a band together where I will sing and play. How would you like to cough up some money?” At the time, that was very possible. You could get, you know, $15,000 in advance and that would finance the entire recording, and maybe a support band tour, and everything, you know? Because I did some mistakes when I was 16 and 17. We signed some, you know, whatever, Chicken Brain Records for 94 records and so on, in a row. And you signed it in blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;And it took me forever to get rid of that. And I said “I don’t want to be the dumb musician, I want to actually be in control.”&lt;/span&gt; And in the early days of course I was starving like everybody else. It was really tough, you know. You didn’t have any money and you couldn’t pay any food. But I still kept on going. Instead of “Hey, I’ll play in a bar band.” You know, top 100 stuff. There’s nothing wrong with that, I don’t want to be arrogant. But it was not for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I spent weeks with my 4-track cassette kind of recording device and just recording new stuff all the time. And trying to, again, grow my own moustache. Dig myself up. I haven’t got a clue what the question was. But yes, thing are better and better looking back. It’s like, yeah, things are good. A lot of musicians, they complain their brains out all the time. “Oh, you can’t sell records.” No, but you can sell stuff on iTunes, and you can sell stuff here and there. “Oh, you can’t tour. Nobody will show up.” Well, you know if you… You have to adapt anyway. You cannot sit home and complain like “this is not at all like 1988!” You know? No it’s not! It’s a different time! But there’s money to be made, absolutely. And you’ve just got to go out there and grab it and find ways to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/bgs5M-n5okw?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Have you always had such a strong desire to be unique on your own, or did that come from influences?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: I think it came from influences. I haven’t really… Again, doing stuff for the sake of doing it, say well “I just want to be strange for the sake of being.” Well that’s easy. You can set yourself on fire and [garbled] off your ass and record it, whatever, and you will get some likes. And then the next day you will smell funny and nobody will ever [garbled] you again, you know? Or whatever, you know. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;People are desperate for quick attention. The hard thing is to do something in the long run and do something that’s worth while.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Quick attention, that’s social media. People do anything. “Hey, take your car and drive over me please. And record it so we can get some likes! Kill me now! Kill me now! I want some attention!” You know, you’re not bigger than your latest post, which is a crock of shit. Of course, people are cool, you know? Leave them alone for a while. I go crazy when, again all my colleagues, they post their brains out. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;There’s this ooze of desperation out there. You know? “Look at me! Look at me! Look at me!” Or you don’t exist.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Well, I exist. I certainly don’t want to post every day. I post when I have something to say, or “Hey, there’s a gig,” or “Hey, look at my new record, and here’s a video.” I don’t want to post “Oh, here’s me! I have snot in my nose on the way to the tour bus. Woo hoo! Likes anyone?” Who gives a shit, you know? And again, it takes away the cool stuff. It takes away the magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Again, you think about that stuff when you listen to the music. So it kind of makes the music sort of transparent as well, you know? Leave it. Sometimes it’s good to shut the fuck up. Said I, suffering from verbal diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Verbal Diarrhea is my favorite band, by the way. I just love them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: There is a band called Verbal Diarrhea? I didn’t even know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: No, I was joking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: [laughing] Okay, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Hey, so you’ve spoken a little about influences. You’ve mentioned a couple of names. Who are some of the musicians, or it were, that formed your musical identity and informed your sense of uniqueness and holding on to that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Well, uh, it started with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiss_(band)&quot;&gt;KISS &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. They had a major impact on my 6-7 year old Mattias Eklundh. Because it was blood and fire, and you know it was just big and amazing and dangerous. So that was great, I was really into KISS and I decided when &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destroyer_(Kiss_album)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Destroyer&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; came out, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alive!_(Kiss_album)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alive!&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; too, this is it! This is what I’m gonna do! But then Frank Zappa came along in ’81 and messed me up quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Because I said, “I like this as well. Why do I like quintuplets and fire and explosions? &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Can you combine quintuplets with blood spitting?” And said “Yeah, I think you can! And I will try to do that!”&lt;/span&gt; So I actually got to meet Frank when I was 11 years old and it was great. I don’t think I really got it, but it was really… it was doing something to me. Then I started to pick it up even more a few years later, buying some albums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Still liking KISS, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Maiden&quot;&gt;Iron Maiden &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judas_Priest&quot;&gt;Judas Priest &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And then my brother-in-law he showed me, “Hey, check this guy out. His name is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_Reinhardt&quot;&gt;Django Reinhardt &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and he played with two fingers.” And for me it was “Wow! What a hardcore thing! This is great!” It was, you know, old gypsy jazz but I thought he could shred like crazy. And it was amazing, you know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/rD36-Zn2bA4?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And then I discovered &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahavishnu_Orchestra&quot;&gt;Mahavishnu Orchestra &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and I love that. So I started to get into odd time and all that stuff. My mom has always been interested in Indian music and my dad would play train records. Just sounds of old trains. On LP! So there would be &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Peterson&quot;&gt;Oscar Petersen &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Shankar&quot;&gt;Ravi Shankar &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train_(band)&quot;&gt;Train &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sweet&quot;&gt;Sweet &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Cooper], KISS, Iron Maiden, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Davis&quot;&gt;Miles Davis &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Django Reinhardt, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slayer&quot;&gt;Slayer &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, all of it. So for me it’s pretty much good music or bad music. If you’ve got stuff to say, chances are quite good that I will like it if you play it like you mean it and so on. But of course Frank Zappa has been insanely influential on my Swedish self. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: What about song composition? When did you start writing music and how did it sound early on, and what has been the evolution of your songwriting?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Well, two of my really early hits… one was called &lt;em&gt;Homework Rots My Mind&lt;/em&gt;, and the other one was simply called &lt;em&gt;Go To Hell&lt;/em&gt;. We performed that when I was 9 or 10 years old, and my mom and dad had been to India and the uh… what the hell is that called? Incense do you call it? It smells a lot and some tiny smoke. We didn’t know what a smoke machine was, so we just duct taped together like a really big pack of incense in our classroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And I still have the recording of it. I played drums at that gig and after the first song you could hear some of my classmates saying “Could you get rid of the smoke? My eyes are running.” “Well we don’t have a smoke machine, so we need some smoke!” That classroom was never the same again. So yeah, you do what you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But I started to write songs very early on, 3-chord songs and 4-chord songs, and so on. Writing a song is always slippery. You never know really… a good song should be, I think you should be able to perform it on a banjo if that’s what it is. You know? I really don’t do a lot of growling. I’m still a lot into harmony. You can be aggressive, but then I like to actually hear what people are saying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I like a good scream every once in a while, but I still work a lot with harmony and tonality and rhythm, and stuff like that. Then it’s a matter of dressing it up and arranging it, and producing it. And it’s tricky, but I love it. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I love to make something out of nothing. That’s really the biggest kick.&lt;/span&gt; To walk into the studio with that strange cup of coffee and just “Oh, get behind the drumkit today? No, didn’t work? I’ll try the mandolin. No, it didn’t really generate any sparks.” Creative sparks, you know. Then I’ll sit with my 8 string and come up with something. And having a studio of your own is beautiful because of course you can just do something, right away. “Hey, I’ll do something today. I’ll write a song. I’ll record it. I’ll mix it! You know? And that’s great.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/wGo1Q4_F2LI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I’ve heard you talk about boredom being a great source of inspiration. Can you talk about that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Yeah. That’s Sweden for you. Sweden equals boredom. Nothing happens. Nobody is here. No, but I think it was somebody… there’s some video out there with a guy who shot, when I think I was asked during a clinic somewhere in Holland somebody asked “Do you have a special app that you practice to?” And I started to… there’s a slight fury inside there, because this is exactly what I do not like about today’s technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s because I make rock music. That’s really what it is. It’s a twisted version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC/DC&quot;&gt;AC/DC &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in a way, you know? And I plug in to my amplifier. I play very loud. I don’t like really racks of Line 6 stuff. I’m very very old school when it comes to that stuff. A lot of people think I have a lot of gear and effects. I do not. I plug straight into the amplifier and do everything with my passive volume pedal. No batteries or adapter. The rest are my fingers, you know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;What was the question again? I can’t remember… yes! Boredom! Boredom, boredom. Anyway, so I got this, “Do you have this practice routine, and have you heard about this app, and you can slow down, and you can do this, and…” And I just went crazy and said “There’s no bloody app for this! &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Spend 10 hours every day like me and give yourself the time, you know, and give yourself the opportunity to actually be good at something.&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Today everything is super fast, you know? Everything has to happen in a second, and if you’re not a top-notch player by the end of the week, you do something else! And everybody has a restless leg. I sit next to them in old planes, and just “Sit the f… still! Still! Be still! Breathe! Relax! Read a book! Spend an hour watching the clouds, you know?” But everything has to be “(gasp) Half way through the movie I’ll skip to another movie, or I’ll check the phone in the meanwhile. Oh, there’s no wifi on the plane? We’re fucked!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So again, long walks in the Swedish woods with the dogs really helps. You know, I need it. I really need it to block things out. I never bring my phone when visiting nature. And living in the countryside is good as well. I was much more confused when I was living in the city. Not everybody of course can live in the countryside, that’s how it is. But for me, it’s importanté really to clean my head and cleanse my brain. So boredom is important, you know. Allow yourself to be bored. It’s tricky, but it’s good for you, and it’s good for creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Are you a trained musician? Did you go to school ever in your career to study music or receive formal lessons in music theory, harmony?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Not at all! I’m a complete schmuck! I had a flute lesson when I was 10 and I hated it, and that’s it. I quit school, as I said before, when I was 16 and that’s it. And one day, one of my older sisters who, she was in big trouble years before that, but then she grew up and became a conductor. Which is obviously the way to do after sniffing super glue is to conduct an orchestra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/PJSRYXOHqsY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;She walked in to me and she asked me to play an F major 7 chord. She was into some Stevie Wonder song, I think &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Are_the_Sunshine_of_My_Life&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sunshine Of Your Life&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And I was shredding my brains out. I could sweep and swoop, and riff, and so on. But I didn’t know what an F major 7 chord was. And the most humiliating thing is when you are 15 – 16, and your older sister is moving your flying-V fingers around. You know, heavily distorted, and says “No no no, THIS is an F major 7.” No it’s like, FUCK YOU!!! So I just crawled away to the library and really just smashed all these books about musical theory and everything inside my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And really it was this eureka moment. It was really “I got it! I understand what is called a major 7, or a flat 7, or this is a Lydian scale. I can play the Lydian scale at warp speed, no problem! I just didn’t have a name. And if I don’t play the major 7, if I play a flat 7 and play the Lydian it’s called the Lydian dominant, also called the overtone scale, also used by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Béla_Bartók&quot;&gt;Bela Bartok &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” and so on…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And that was a really cool thing! And if I put this dot here, that means it’s an F sharp. Great! So I educated myself all the way, and now I have since 18 years… this is the 18th year I have my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freakguitar.com/fgc.html&quot;&gt;Freak Guitar Camp &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where I sit on my guru chair, which is a bit higher than everyone else’s for ego boosting, and also they can see my playing, and so yes. And we have 70 players from all over the world every year. And I started to take registrations for this summer last weekend, there are a few spots left, and then it’s sold out again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;You know, and I’m really grateful. But I write so much music. Really, practicing stuff. There’s a lot of, I have this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/freakguitartv&quot;&gt;FreakGuitarTV YouTube channel &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, there’s a lot of stuff called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGxpEubwDraVfVjbhSx7L65mmRrK1078e&quot;&gt;Growing Your Own Moustache &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that’s leftover kind of camp stuff. But this is also, of course, put down in notation and tablature. We explore Indian tonality and Japanese tonality, and all kinds of rhythms and reduction structures, and how to write a good song, and they get to meet a lot of people from all over the place, and lots of other guests and everything that I fly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/W2-R40yNY_I?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Jan Zehreld has been there. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guthrie_Govan&quot;&gt;Guthrie Govan &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_%22Bumblefoot%22_Thal&quot;&gt;Bumblefoot &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonas_Hellborg&quot;&gt;Jonas Hellborg &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and lots of Indians… it’s a tip-top thing, you know? And I’m honored to be able to do it. I cannot remember the question again, I’m just talking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: It was about being formally trained in any way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Yes, yes. No, I’ve educated myself. That’s the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Do you write out your music after you write it or as you’re writing it to remember the idea? Or is it you’re recording audio snippets here and there? How do you go about this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Usually it’s just recording. Walking into the studio or recording it on whatever, the cell phone or whatever, really quickly. Then I have a right hand, he’s a former camper, he’s so fast when it comes to music notation. So sometimes it’s like, “can you? This is a complicated tune and I’ll explain what I want to do… “ And he’s like, writing an email. He’s that fast. “Can you do this for me? I’ll give money. Just do it!” You know? So sometimes you have entire song transcriptions and everything, and sometimes I do it myself as well, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I’ve heard you use loops in some music, modified loops. I know that that’s played some kind of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnatic_music&quot;&gt;Carnatic rhythm &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; type stuff going on in your music, and I’ve also seen you completely destroy the use of other things and turning them into musical elements. So do you get a sense of melody and that drives a song? Or do you start with chords, or do you start with a sound? Or what do you seem to favor and how does that lead to a song?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: I think it’s different every time. Sometimes obviously it’s a hook, it’s a melody, it’s a riff… that has a melody, or it’s a cool riff from a cool rhythm. Sometimes it’s these unorthodox devices. You know, printers, and (clears throat) dildos, and combs, and hose clips, or whatever. But again, I find it very important not to, again, be weird for the sake of being weird, you know? &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;All the stuff I use, it may be a chopstick or whatever, is because you can only get that sound from a plastic chopstick. It’s not because “Hey! I want to be super-duper special! I want to use a chopstick today. Woo hoo!”&lt;/span&gt; or I walk around looking for things to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/RSRgkdoK19A?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It’s… almost everything is by mistake. And therefore I feel it’s much cooler, and I don’t know. You know, it works. The comb, for instance, I was alone in a Spanish hotel room and my luggage was somewhere else, no WiFi. 10 hours til sound check, and then you have this Air France survival kit, and everything, and I just started to comb the strings. And it was just, “This is great! I’ve never heard this before!” And so it has to have some kind of musical point. You know? Some kind of sound that you can only do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Same thing with the dildo. It was a sort of “Hey! Hey! Funny birthday gift!” And of course “Hey! It’s got a motor inside! I’ll try it on the guitar!” And it was woo-hoo! You know? I used to do it in a very overkill kind of way. I used to have like 10 or 15 dildos strapped onto my Swedish body and the guitar would come down from the light rig, and I would rub myself, and with the dildos going at different speeds, and the audience would love it. But it became too much because I threw them out. So nevermind! But you have to have some kind of point. That’s what it’s all about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: The life of a musician is very different in reality than people think from looking at magazines. Was that something that you realized early on, and does that impact you in the way that you look at yourself as a musician?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Well, for me it’s that the travel can be quite harsh. And again when you… I’ve been all around the planet, you know. There was one year, I think 2 or 3 years ago, I visited every bloody continent. It was insane. It was just too much. I remember the last trip before Christmas I was, ah, did some performance in Germany, then I went to Abu Dhabi, and then I went to Australia for a week. Moved every week, you know? Different stages every week.. And then I went to Indonesia, played Jarkarta, Bandung, then I went to China, then I went to Nepal, did Live In Kathmandu, back to Dubai, and then back to Europe. And this was in two and a half weeks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;I was just dead meat. It took me a month to recover, you know? Different time zones every day. “Oh, we have to get up early, Mattias, to get the plane to Shanghai.” And so on, you know. It was madness. You sleep 3-4 hours a day, and you’re also supposed to be a superhero every time you walk on stage, you know? You do a 2 hour clinic or a beefy gig or whatever. And it’s tough. It’s really really tough. And people when you talk to them, “Oh great, so you’ve been to Australia! Did you see any kangaroos?” Yes, I did, from the cab to the hotel or from the air. So basically you spend your time in lobbies and airports, and you see that stuff that nobody wants to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/1iTWUyPq-3E?list=PLGxpEubwDraU9bABs-XUXA8KUAWGYox6_&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So I have no real illusions about being a professional musician. On the other hand, it’s a great job because you get to travel the planet. You know, I’m honored that people actually show up and that I can provide my family a groovy life with doing just what I’m doing. So that’s great, but boy it’s tough. We just did a 4 gig Italian tour in November. And planning was great, logistics were fine and everything, everything was tip-top, it was an early flight from Gothenburg. But of course Lufthansa, which was the airline company, they were on a strike. So they said, “Oh there is no way we’re gonna get you to Milan in time.” And we met like 4 in the morning, and it was going to be a cool day with lots of sleep and catching up and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;It didn’t happen, of course. We got stuck in Dusseldorf and our backdrop was stolen, we barely reached the gig, and then for the next days we travelled like crazy. We’re 10 hours a day in the bus and no sleep whatsoever, you know. And then in Rome, while we were on stage in Rome, all the shit in Paris happened. You know, with the shootings and this terrible thing. And all of a sudden military came running and it was just madness all over the place. So you say to someone “Ah, we played Rome last Friday.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;“Oh great. Did you have an espresso macchiato? Take some time off? Did you watch the Coloseum?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;“Not really, no. I was sitting in a freezing backstage room while,” you know… So that’s how it is. Still, I don’t want to complain because this is what I choose to do and it’s great. But again I’m 46 and I’ve done it for such a long time. So we don’t want to do crappy things. It’s not super charming to always have a lack of sleep. And you age too fast in a way, you know. Overnight you get a really gray beard and “Oh good God, I look like a saddlebag. My face…” You know, some leather eyes, yes. But that’s okay,.. dead fish eyes. So it’s still okay, you know. I have seen more than people will do in a lifetime, I’ve seen in a year. From walking around in Calcutta or, hey! Live in Johannesburg, so I don’t want to change it, but it’s tough, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: You play guitar, you are a producer of bands, perhaps you even rent out your studio for people to record and you might help with engineering. How has your career expanded and evolved, and what does that look like for the future and the next 10 years for you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: I actually don’t rent my studio out because I built it like a 2 floor big playing ground, really. So there’s no walls to separate the drums. It’s just big, open space. And I love that to just be able to crawl over to the drums and so on. But yes, it’s a good questions because again I don’t want to tour to death. When people say “Can you come for 3 months to the states and tour?” “Haha! Are you kidding? 3 months away from the Swedish woods? Nope! We can come for two and a half weeks, that’s it. And you’ve got to pay us as well.” You know, so that’s really what it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So we do want to tour, but we’re all parents and we’re all middle-aged men. And in order to do good, you have to… Because I see a lot of miserable musician friends. They tour their brains out and all the money they earn, or even merchandise, it goes straight to some, I dunno, strange management account or whatever, and they return after 3 months on the road with no money. It’s not okay! They’ve been busting their asses, you know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So um, but the thing is, we’re gonna launch this next month. It’s called No Bull Stuff or No B.S. Organic Clothing featuring the Freak Kitchen cow. I just today I have, damn I wish you could see, a beautiful hood we have again eco-clothing in India that we’re making because I have a connection with India. So that’s really cool. And it’s me and a friend who used to make the Freak Kitchen merchandise, so that’s a cool business and our wives will be involved as well, picking, you know, packing stuff and shipping it. So that’s great, and also doing something good for the planet because the clothing industry is, of course, complete caca as they say in France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/y2vzBdIejVY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So that’s cool, and I’ve also, last year we did this lovely video called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2vzBdIejVY&quot;&gt;Freak Of The Week with Juanjo Guarnido &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and a team from Disney and a lovely Parisian studio as well. And we’re in 2014, there was a book about it. And this opened up the world of animation for me. I adore of course watching Disney and Pixar with my family, and all of a sudden a relative from very far away, called Ben Rush, called me one day and said “Hey, I’m working at Dreamworks and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juanjo_Guarnido&quot;&gt;Juanjo Guarnido &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was here and showed your Freak Of The Week video, and I realized hey! That’s my distant cousin! We met when we were kids in Sweden!” And it’s like “Holy shit! I want to work together!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And now we’ve begun, we’re gonna start this IndieGoGo campaign of financing his first movie on his own. He’s now with Pixar but he wants to make this indie film called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/OnlyADreamMovie/&quot;&gt;Only A Dream &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m writing music for it. And that’s great as well. I’d love to take a year off and just write music for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/iUSPjWAlWxY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;But I’ve also begun doing stop-motion. I love stop-motion. It’s insane just doing these animations. And the other day there was this company, it was a friend of mine, a Freak Guitar Camper, but he has this company said “We would like five sort of, I don’t know, stir around a bit kind of videos because we want to put it on social media and create some attention. Can you make some?” Because I did a few short, I call it minimalist animation kind of videos. And it’s “I love this! Can you make 5 for me?” And he paid a lot of money and it was great! And it’s like “Sure! I’d love to! Just to see what I can do.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;So there I was, 25 frames or 24 in America per second, moving stuff around, and it turned out great. I loved it. And it’s lovely to sit down, because it’s so time consuming, in complete quiet. You know, and you do the most weird things with your body when you do stop-motion because you cannot screw it up. And I love that as well, and then I make music for it and that’s the beauty of today’s technology as well. And you throw it up on YouTube in full HD, 1080p. So yeah, it’s great. God I’m talking a lot. I’m sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/z4Zyk9g-MiU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: No, please don’t apologize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Alright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: The site is called Make Weird Music. You’ve talked about that you do KISS and Frank Zappa music kind of with a twist. Could you describe the twist for us and what that means to you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: I’ve always, again as I said, been trying to grow my own moustache. &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;But I always want to sort of stay on the right side of weird&lt;/span&gt;, you know what I mean? I don’t want to alienate people. I don’t want to put people away. Obviously I want people to hear my stuff. But I also want to include things that you normally don’t do. Not for the sake of doing it, just because I’m interested in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1JRHkp7D4E?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;If I travel to India, for instance, and I spend time in Chennai with just kids clapping hands. Listening to their, sort of, Carnatic rhythm structures it freaks me out! I said “Jesus Christ! I didn’t know this! This is excellent!” They could be 8 year old kids and they kick my ass so bad. They don’t give a shit if I know &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dweezil_Zappa&quot;&gt;Dweezil Zappa &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or I hang out with the guys in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meshuggah&quot;&gt;Meshuggah &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. They don’t care, you know? And I’m amazed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And I bring it back to Sweden and I try to incorporate it, again without making it so ‘out there’ that nobody would listen to it. It has to have a groove. I always go back before production and listen to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_There_Be_Rock_(song)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let There Be Rock&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with AC/DC and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-Nite_Sensation&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Over-Nite Sensation&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with Frank Zappa. And sometimes a little bit of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Petty&quot;&gt;Tom Petty &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, say &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Into_the_Great_Wide_Open&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Into The Great Wide Open&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, just good pop record. And say, &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;“Why are these records so good? And how can I try to keep my cool and make good songs, but also incorporate all the elements that I’m interested in?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;Because Freak Kitchen is not like, say Panzerballett. They are wonderful, but they are insane. They’re just insane. I laugh my ass off every time. We don’t want to do that. We have a different audience, in a way. You know, we want people to… we have kids and girls and boys and whatever, you know. We can play a death metal festival, or we can plan an indie Brit pop kind of festival, and we still work. We don’t want to be too ‘out there’ because it has to be still a good song.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;And of course Panzerballett, you know they make excellent music, you know what I mean. But Jan is really exploring the depths of madness and so on. But &lt;span class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;I always go back to this “Why is this Tom Petty song so good? I like this. I want this melody. I want something like this&lt;/span&gt;, but I also want to have an Indian reduction structure attached to it or a quintuplet.” So that’s what I do. But I never sit down and think about it in a kind of intentional kind of way. “Today I’m gonna write a song in 9/8 and then I’m going to use this raga.” I do not! I just sit in front of the fireplace with my acoustic guitar. You have a lovely acoustic guitar behind your head. And write music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Oh I do, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Yes you do! And that’s how it is. It has to come natural, otherwise the song will be paper thin, you know? So yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: That’s wonderful. I love that description. Because I don’t want to convey the wrong side of weird. As much as I love &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cow&quot;&gt;Henry Cow &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I’d love to make music that my wife doesn’t hate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Yeah, true! Exactly. And the kids, they love it. The ultimate test is when you play stuff for 8 year old kids. Do they like it? If they like it, it’s good. You know, that’s really how it is. Do they get off on it in a way? So yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: That’s awesome. Thank you so much for your time. I really appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Thank you! Thank you! It’s been amazing. I’ll send you strange photo photo, and strange videos and all kinds of things. How does this work? Are you gonna put it live out there? Are you gonna transcribe? Or how are you gonna do it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: I transcribe every interview. I have video tracks for everyone. I edit the video, I put in quote highlights. So yeah, and I do custom art so if there’s a photo you’d like me to turn into a cartoon of you I can do that as well. But otherwise I’ll just find something and you can look at some of the other interviews on the site and see what I’ve done. You might get something out of it. We’ll see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Very good. Well thanks a bunch. It was a pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Oh it’s my pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;M: Let me know when it’s out there, and I will spread it like herpes we talked about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;A: Yeah, I really could use that.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Ignite Phoenix MWM Presentation</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-an-honor&quot;&gt;What an Honor!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a huge honor to present Make Weird Music to 850 people at &lt;a href=&quot;http://ignitephoenix.com&quot;&gt;Ignite Phoenix &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; #18 on April 1, 2016 at &lt;a href=&quot;http://scottsdaleperformingarts.org&quot;&gt;Scottsdale Center for the Performing Arts &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It was also one of the most nerve-wracking things I’ve ever done and it’s taken me several days to understand why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/YKqre-waCI8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special thanks to Raoul Encinas for telling me about Ignite and inviting me to submit, and to Todd Weinstein, who coached me through the whole process.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the weeks leading up to Ignite, I didn’t think too much about the reality of speaking in front of so many people. I also didn’t realize how personal my little speech would be and how vulnerable I would feel delivering it. Like a song idea in its infancy, I let no one hear me rehearse and only two people had seen the script I wrote: my assigned speaking coach and my awesome friend, &lt;a href=&quot;http://elevatingideas.com&quot;&gt;Will Mejia &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who designed the slides (and the MWM logo). Not even my wife really knew what I was cooking up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nerves&quot;&gt;Nerves&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I speak publicly on a regular basis for my job, it’s usually to a crowd of 50 or fewer people. Plus, when I do that, it’s usually in a controlled environment with people who are known to be interested. If there are slides, they’re on my laptop and I advance them when I’m ready. Most importantly, I rarely have to get candid about something so close to my heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;centered&quot;&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/mranathema/26156379521/in/photolist-FRmhmH-FXcA5z-FTe1by-FPDN4M-FvpA8N-FPE2ar-FRkujH-FP2xhq-FTekYj-F1g9ip-F2WzbM-Fx6ULU-FVvNnr-FP2xCq-F2XHpP-FXdrkP-F2XH4Z-FUUSNG-FUVCaw-F2KUpE-FXcii8-FUUu5L-Fx6RBs-FXdnWV-FP3zvm-FUUuxE-F2XEZt-FP3CgS-FUVyJy-FXdkiD-F2XC48-FyNE49-F4EoDK-FPDMSp-FPDKKD-FvpD61-FYyTo4-FQp49w-FWh1pL-FSH8Cc-F48iN5-FysdW5-F2LSVq-F1fPRe-FUVwaq-FRkAka-FXdmnn-Fx6KQh-FXciPP-F2KUby&quot; title=&quot;IgnitePhx18 (60 of 289)&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1472/26156379521_4dae5ea150.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; alt=&quot;IgnitePhx18 (60 of 289)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even though I play at church to a crowd of 800+ people on a regular basis, there is a bigger purpose to that and it has very little to do with me and my playing. At church, I am supporting an event and an environment that lets people tune themselves into the right spiritual mindset, like &lt;a href=&quot;/interview/kerry-minnear&quot;&gt;Kerry Minnear talked about in his interview&lt;/a&gt;. My Ignite presentation was about &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; passion, with no instrument speaking on my behalf or representing me to the crowd. Totally different from church!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of those things, plus some unpredictable personal and professional events/issues, led to my frenetic panic in the final 48 hours leading up to my presentation. My stomach was turning all day at work on April 1 and I was seriously regretting that I ever agreed to do it. I had a very real understanding of what artist &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_White_(artist)&quot;&gt;Wayne White &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; meant when he said, “&lt;a href=&quot;http://buy.beautyisembarrassing.com&quot;&gt;Beauty is embarrassing &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thanks-to-the-guitar-circle&quot;&gt;Thanks to the Guitar Circle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, I had a few tricks up my sleeve I’d learned from &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/king-crimson&quot;&gt;Robert Fripp&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Craft&quot;&gt;Guitar Circle &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; coursework. The practice of doing nothing, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_technique&quot;&gt;Alexander Technique &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and finding the silence within were all extremely helpful in soothing my nerves before the presentation. About 15 minutes before I had to go on stage, I realized how supportive the audience was and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.progressiveears.org/forum/showthread.php/15254-Mr-Fripp-not-amused-in-Toronto&quot;&gt;how much that factored into what Fripp shared during his 2015 tour with King Crimson&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;centered&quot;&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/nooccar/26137186551/in/photolist-FPDUXr-FvpoaQ-FTdXou-FTdTSS-F1fMUD-FvpdfE-FTedBA-FvpB45-F15y5W-FTe3qo-FTefPS-FVwa3e-FTeexd-FMm9f7-FPDZyv-FPEf9T-F15sD5-FPDGvc-FPE9Mk-F1ggLa-F1fVtM-FMkQau-F15wsY-F4oign-FPE6rH-F1g4q8-F1gjwR-FVvNEk-FPE4Qg-F1gahP-FMmeJU-FVw4sr-FvpuMs-F15s35-FPEaZR-FvppZb-FTe9WQ-FVw1LV-FPE9SR-F15mc7-F1fLWB-F48imJ-F4j1Gt-FSUDgt-FWh2pS-FSUCdM-FyDLrh-FSUCxK-F4sU4w-FyDLcu&quot; title=&quot;1604 IgnitePhx 1886&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1466/26137186551_55343c8668.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; alt=&quot;1604 IgnitePhx 1886&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It never dawned on me how important a supportive audience could be. It also never dawned on me how difficult an experience it could be to perform from the heart to an unsupportive audience. Had it not been for the wonderful support of the Ignite attendees, there is a high likelihood I would have bombed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that I didn’t bomb at all. The presentation went much better than I expected. I only screwed up on one slide and recovered in a decent way. And here it is on the Internet for all to see and (presumably) enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;so-personal&quot;&gt;So Personal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the practice in the world could not have prepared me for the experience of baring my soul to a crowd of that size. Practicing alone in a bedroom or while driving my car doesn’t leave room for audience laughter at my jokes, or for an emotional statement to make its mark. And to hear your own voice booming from loudspeakers in a non-nightmare context is a very strange thing. Thankfully, the stage lights were bright enough that I couldn’t make out a single face and the 5 minutes flew by faster than I could have expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who know me personally tell me that I’m often non-emotional or “cool as a cucumber.” Doing this presentation exposed a part of me that has been well-hidden (or perhaps dormant) for many years. I was so nervous throughout the day that after my presentation, I had to leave the building and almost went home sick from all the abdominal tension that was suddenly released once I was finished. I was in tremendous pain that, thankfully, went away after about an hour. The mind-body connection is real, yo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;centered&quot;&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/megawatson/25643147214/in/photolist-F4ZQgQ-F4ZL41-FX9x2Y-FzjPkq-F5bppH-FzjJQo-F4ZB9Y-FzjghN-F5aETF-FziYyC-F5ax4n-FRfySS-FZqkEz-F4YErG-FRftTJ-F4YB4E-FZqdWV-FRfpvA-FziEGW-FSv4FE-G1EQkg-F6dVaq-G1EAti-F6ppCg-F6p9P8-FYmQE3-FStVuG-F6cZxW-FUN8SP-F6oFCe-F6cXsJ-FYmGas-F6oBTa-G1DyNr-FYmCjG-FAx4wb-FYmzMY-FYmzo1-F6cNzd-F6ouCZ-F6otSF-FAwXRd-FUMRHV-FStzUE-F6omYa-G1DjDK-FAwQxA-FAwP1C-FYmajE-G1CVxp&quot; title=&quot;Ignite Phoenix 18 IMG_6088&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1526/25643147214_08621a0307.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; alt=&quot;Ignite Phoenix 18 IMG_6088&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am glad for the experience I had and grateful for the opportunity. It was great to hear the support of fellow enthusiasts of weird music. And many approached me afterward in gratitude for my work, which was totally unexpected and heartwarming. I don’t think it will lead to a great, big local following, but it was nice to have my 5 minutes of fame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is definitely nice to get back to normal life where I have no major deadlines with my MWM work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-ignite-phoenix&quot;&gt;What’s Ignite Phoenix?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ignite Phoenix, started in 2008 by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JMoriartyFOX10&quot;&gt;Jeff Moriarty &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is part of a larger &lt;a href=&quot;http://content.ignitetalks.io/about/&quot;&gt;Ignite Talks &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; movement that started in 2006. It gives passionate people a platform to present their personal pursuits in a 5-minute presentation format where 20 slides auto-advance every 15 seconds. It’s a very popular event here in the Phoenix, AZ area and tickets sell out in less than an hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the people behind Ignite are passionate volunteers and they really make it a magical, diverse event. I presented between someone who talked about collecting sports cards of female athletes and someone who talked about a foster program in Arizona. The variety of ideas was huge and I strongly encourage you to attend an Ignite event if there’s one near you. I’m not sure if I’d recommend speaking unless you’re really super-duper passionate about a topic and willing to get out there and share it in a way that is totally unique and frightening. If anything, the networking opportunities make it totally worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Failure to Fracture, Episode 2</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;episode-2-picking-the-right-pick&quot;&gt;Episode 2: Picking the Right Pick&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago (almost to the day!), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dgmlive.com/diaries.htm?entry=3463&quot;&gt;Robert Fripp paid me a compliment in his online diary&lt;/a&gt; in response to videos and blog posts I’d written at that time about playing &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt;. He said, “Mr. Garone’s work on this is honourable, and has my respect.” This sentence motivated me for many years to continue pursuing &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, he made a recommendation that, for some reason, took me years to understand: use a sharp pick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/fracture/id978457922?i=978458012&quot;&gt;Purchase King Crimson’s &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt; on iTunes &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://store.nexternal.com/dgm/starless-and-bible-black-c228.aspx&quot;&gt;Or, purchase the album on Robert Fripp’s website &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;video&quot;&gt;Video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the video to accompany this episode of &lt;em&gt;Failure to Fracture&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/o4f1POCrKXE&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-failure-to-fracture&quot;&gt;What is &lt;em&gt;Failure to Fracture&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/learn/fracture&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Failure to Fracture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a video series I’ve put together about all the things that have stood in the way of my successfully playing the song &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/king-crimson&quot;&gt;King Crimson&lt;/a&gt; despite years and years of study, practice, writing, and making videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;episode-list&quot;&gt;Episode List&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/learn/fracture&quot;&gt;Episode 0: Introduction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/learn/fracture/stress&quot;&gt;Episode 1: Stress and Tension&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/learn/fracture/picks&quot;&gt;Episode 2: Picking Picks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;picks-picks-picks&quot;&gt;Picks, Picks, Picks!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Mr. Fripp recommended use of a sharp pick, he wrote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The recommended pick is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guitarcraftguitars.com/picks.html&quot;&gt;a triangular Guitar Craft pick&lt;/a&gt;, of which there is a small production line, handmade in Japan by Mr. Hiroshi Iketani. If a Dunlop Tortex is the only choice, I would use the Tortex Sharp &amp;amp; consider that life was hard, cruel &amp;amp; unfair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I had no access to the triangular Guitar Craft pick at the time, I bought &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Dunlop-412P1-0-Tortex%C2%AE-Sharp-Players/dp/B000PTRJW8&quot;&gt;Dunlop Tortex Sharps&lt;/a&gt; and it made a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; difference in tone and accuracy. (I prefer the yellow .73mm ones.) Here’s what I love about them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They make your strings sound &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; brighter and more clear&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pick noise is severely reduced&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They’re slightly longer than a normal pick, so there’s more to grip&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reduces accidental string muting&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sounds much more like Fripp!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a normal pick makes it harder to play &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt; for the reasons I just listed. Normal picks don’t have the clear tone of a sharp pick. They’re noisy and make a lot of noise because you’re almost always rubbing the surface of the pick across a string instead of striking through a string. They’re shorter and not as grippy. Their shortness also makes it hard to let long notes ring during the “death picking” part of &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt;. And if you’re really trying to play like Fripp and sound like him, you’re not going to have good luck with a normal pick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;guitar-craft-triangular-picks&quot;&gt;Guitar Craft Triangular Picks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I attended the Guitar Circle intro course, some official india rubber Guitar Craft picks were available for purchase. It turns out there are two types of GC picks: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_rubber&quot;&gt;india rubber&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyoxymethylene&quot;&gt;delrin&lt;/a&gt;. My india rubber picks are shiny, slick, and fancier than the delrin ones. The delrin ones have a matte, fine texture and I prefer them to the india rubber ones. Guitarist &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.steveball.com/index.htm&quot;&gt;Steve Ball&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.steveball.com/words/history/PickHistory/&quot;&gt;a written history of the picks on his website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These picks are definitely, definitely awesome. Before I had any access to these picks, I bought every sharp pick I could find on the market. The only ones that even come close to the GC picks are the Tortex Sharps Fripp recommended. The biggest advantage (for me) to the triangular pick is that it doesn’t spin or move nearly as much when playing &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;other-sharp-picks&quot;&gt;Other Sharp Picks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I understand that it may be my own poor technique that leads to a spinning pick, but I can say that the triangular pick spins the least of any of the picks I’ve seen. Even as I’ve been making this series, I’ve worked pretty hard on my picking grip and have started re-evaluating other sharp picks as I’m learning to better control the pick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all this work, none of the other sharp picks I have come &lt;em&gt;close&lt;/em&gt; to the Tortex Sharps or the GC picks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Jim-Dunlop-478P-88-Tortex®-Players/dp/B00ISQCJRU&quot;&gt;White Dunlop Jazz III picks&lt;/a&gt; are the best of the rest. For GC-style picking that’s suitable for playing &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt;, these are pretty nice, though a little thick for my taste. The other Jazz III picks are just too thick for me.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Dunlop-433P-73-Ultex®-Sharp-Players/dp/B002IJK0H4&quot;&gt;Dunlop Ultex Sharp picks&lt;/a&gt; are fairly nice, but not nearly as “sharp” as the Tortex Sharps. I’ve found the curve near the point of the pick&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/DAndrea-TG355-96HV-Celluloid-Guitar/dp/B001RMDQCY&quot;&gt;D’Andrea triangle picks&lt;/a&gt; are really big. I’ve thought about cutting them down to the size of the GC picks, but then one of the sides would be unfinished and I don’t really think it’s worth it. Plus, the point isn’t very sharp.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Ibanez-Steve-Signature-Rubber-6-Pack/dp/B004CYEPD8&quot;&gt;Ibanez Steve Vai rubber grip picks&lt;/a&gt; are pretty nice picks overall, actually.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we’re on the subject of picks, there are some pretty crazy picks out there. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Ibanez-0-75mm-Sand-Grip-Plectrums/dp/B004CYEPGU&quot;&gt;Ibanez makes one with a sandpaper grip&lt;/a&gt;! I just ordered this crazy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.v-picks.com/product/shredder-lite/&quot;&gt;V-Pick “Shredder Lite” triangular guitar pick&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll see how that goes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Panzerballett Typewriter Contest Entry</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In November 2015, &lt;a href=&quot;/discover/panzerballett&quot;&gt;Panzerballett&lt;/a&gt; launched a contest where fans could submit their cover of the song &lt;em&gt;Typewriter II&lt;/em&gt; off their new album, &lt;em&gt;Breaking Brain&lt;/em&gt;. Here is my entry for the competition:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/HRdk3HoknWk&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to know more about Jan Zehrfeld (the mad genius behind Panzerballett), you should &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/interview/jan-zehrfeld&quot;&gt;check out our extensive 5-part interview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, this was quite a bit of work and stretched my capabilities as a player and a person who makes videos on the internet. I’d never tried doing a split-screen effect before, which is tough in my humble little video studio. The sheet music Jan provided to contestants was difficult for me to read, so I had to put every note into a notation editor, then tab it all out so I could remember how to play it. I also improvised through my solos in an effort to retain Jan’s spirit of jazz and improvisation amidst a highly-composed piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For anyone wondering, that is a 6-string guitar with a banjo body called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.deanguitars.com/query?upc=819998000554&quot;&gt;Backwoods 6 Banjo &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which I picked up used for about $170. The acoustic is my trusty Alvarez Yairi DY-40. And the keyboard is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivetti_Lettera_32&quot;&gt;Olivetti Lettera 32 &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; lent to me by my good friend, &lt;a href=&quot;http://elevatingideas.com&quot;&gt;Will Mejia &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who also designed the MWM logo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took about 4 weeks to notate, learn, practice, record, and film the whole thing over many evenings from 9PM til about 1AM. All told, I’m guessing I spent about 60 hours on it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;download-the-mp3&quot;&gt;Download the mp3!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an mp3 of the song (NOTE: hitting the “play” button requires a hefty download of the entire audio file!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;audio src=&quot;http://audio.makeweirdmusic.com/share/typewriter/makeweirdmusic-typewriter.mp3&quot; controls=&quot;&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, &lt;a href=&quot;http://audio.makeweirdmusic.com/share/typewriter/makeweirdmusic-typewriter.mp3&quot;&gt;download an mp3 &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;original-recording&quot;&gt;Original Recording&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/breaking-brain/id1043463853&quot;&gt;Purchase Panzerballett’s &lt;em&gt;Breaking Brain&lt;/em&gt; on iTunes &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the official music video for the original recording of the song:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/5OGoftbnqLM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here’s a promo video for the new album:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/bEdh3IjJ9Gk?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;contest-info&quot;&gt;Contest Info&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial offering for winning the competition was free tickets and aftershow passes to see the band perform and hang out with them on one of their European tour dates. Since I live in the USA, the idea of making my own cover of the song was appealing, but geographically limited and financially impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Isvjirm1K8M?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months later, Jan announced there was a chance to win an Ibanez 8-string guitar. I saw that video and knew I had to cover the song in a unique way and make a fun video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/RbtWb6edQJ8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like what I’ve done, leave a comment and/or share the video. Thanks so much for checking this out! And thank you, Jan, for providing this opportunity to your fans. It was so much fun!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Prog Cover of BWV 1060R by J.S. Bach</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In December 2013, I released a math-rock/progressive cover version of one of my favorite Bach compositions, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_concertos_by_Johann_Sebastian_Bach#Concerto_in_C_minor.2C_BWV_1060&quot;&gt;Concert for Violin and Oboe Mov. 1, Allegro (BWV 1060R) &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a total shred-fest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/OUDXsoV6-ak&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This performance features:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/interview/andy-west&quot;&gt;Andy West&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dixie_Dregs&quot;&gt;Dixie Dregs &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on bass&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adam Strand (an organist I met at my church) on keyboards&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bryce Bickham of &lt;a href=&quot;http://crimsontone.com&quot;&gt;Crimsontone Amplifiers &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Re-amp&quot;&gt;re-amped &lt;i class=&quot;non-mwm fa fa-external-link-square&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; all my guitar parts through his awesome handmade amps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sebastian’s drum parts are jaw-dropping. Andy’s bass parts are so fun. Adam’s arrangement contributions brought new life to my too-technical work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Artwork for my 2013 &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/bach?src=hash&quot;&gt;#bach&lt;/a&gt; shredfest. Thought it&amp;#39;d be funny to draw myself as Bach. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/F1QXIJX7u3&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/F1QXIJX7u3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Make Weird Music (@MakeWeirdMusic) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MakeWeirdMusic/status/708064442823479296&quot;&gt;March 10, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-and-why&quot;&gt;How and Why&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a piece of music I’ve loved for many years and always knew I wanted to record my own version. I put my stamp on it by messing around with the rhythm of the main motif, which is in 11/8. It took about 10 months to complete the arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s incredibly complex and difficult to perform, well beyond anything I’d previously recorded. There were several parts I couldn’t easily perform as originally written, so I translated those parts into different time signatures and added notes to make them playable. Some parts require some pretty tricky finger-tapping on both hands. It’s more like playing a keyboard on a fretboard than finger-tapping like Eddie Van Halen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I entered all the notes into Logic Pro and used its tablature features to determine the best way to play (and memorize) the various parts. Then I recorded all the parts direct into Logic and sent them to Bryce to re-amp through his beautiful Crimsontone Amps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sebastian, Andy, and Adam each told me that this was one of the hardest songs they’d ever performed. I guess that’s some sort of stamp of honor. Heh.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Favrio Guitars ATG7</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In January 2014, a friend of mine had shared one of my guitar videos on Facebook. A friend of this friend left a comment like, “I’d love if this guy would try one of my guitars!” His name is Rob Fick and he’s a guitar luthier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rob and I started chatting online about the guitars he’s built and his workshop. Then we started talking about building a custom guitar. I live in Arizona and our mutual friend is from Arizona, so I presumed this guy lived in Arizona. I said, “When can I come check out your shop?” and he wrote, “I’m in Bodrum, Turkey!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the logistical challenges, we decided to proceed with the custom “Anthony Garone Signature Model” anyway. He told me about some of the woods he had access to, which sounded intriguing: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millettia_laurentii&quot;&gt;wenge&lt;/a&gt;, Stradivari &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spruce&quot;&gt;spruce&lt;/a&gt; from E. Ciresa in Northern Italy, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapele&quot;&gt;sapele&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;asdf&lt;/p&gt;
