          <h2 id="who-is-bruford">Who is Bruford?</h2>

<p>Bruford was a short-lived quasi-jazz-progressive rock band featuring incredible musicianship, innovative compositions, and some of my favorite songs ever. They released three albums of original compositions, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feels_Good_to_Me">Feels Good to Me</a></em>, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_of_a_Kind_(Bruford_album)">One of a Kind</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradually_Going_Tornado">Gradually Going Tornado</a></em>, along with a couple of live albums.</p>

<p><strong><a href="/learn/hells-bells"><i class="fa fa-youtube-play"></i> Check out our Learn Hell’s Bells post!</a></strong></p>

<p>The band was led Bill Bruford (who you might know from Yes and <a href="/discover/king-crimson">King Crimson</a>) and featured <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Berlin">Jeff Berlin</a> on bass, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Stewart_(keyboardist)">Dave Stewart</a> on keyboards, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Holdsworth">Allan Holdsworth</a> on guitar, who was later replaced by “The Unknown John Clark.” Bruford’s extremely complex music is made to sound effortless by these virtuosic performers.</p>

<p><em>One of a Kind</em> is a groundbreaking instrumental album and my favorite of all their releases. Each song is memorable and has something great to offer. It opens with the track <em><a href="/learn/hells-bells">Hell’s Bells</a></em>, which I dissected in another video. That song is followed by <em>One of a Kind</em>, a two-part song that is very near and dear to my heart. The song <em>5G</em> is so good it’ll make you want to stop playing music. Honestly, every track on the album is great.</p>

<p><em>Gradually Going Tornado</em> features Jeff Berlin on vocals, making a… Uh, best effort. Despite the vocal performance, the songwriting is awesome on this album. <em>Age of Information</em> is a great rock song, but the song <em>Joe Frazier</em> is probably the highlight of this album. It’s an instrumental track that explores some cool, fun territory and Bill Bruford lays a great foundation to let the other band members shine, particularly Jeff Berlin.</p>

<p><em>Feels Good to Me</em> showcases <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annette_Peacock">Annette Peacock</a> on vocals, which may be a bit of an acquired taste for some. Either way, this album was innovative in how it paved the way for dry-mixed, up-front female vocalists, particularly in the avant garde genre. There’s a lot of great instrumental content on the album, including some songs that remained in Bill Bruford’s repertoire for the remainder of his professional career, like <em>Beelzebub</em>.</p>

<p>Some of the weird techniques employed by this band are: odd time signatures and polyrhythms, genre mixing, virtuosic performance, key modulations, extended improvisation, and more. There’s a ton you can learn from listening to Bruford and even more if you put some effort into learning the material.</p>

<p>Despite its short-lived existence, this band made a lasting impact on musicians all over the world. Musicians all over the world are posting YouTube covers and transcriptions of several songs. I plan on publishing some more content in the future covering some more notable Bruford moments.</p>

<p>So, give a listen to each of their releases and see what inspires you to create something new and different.</p>
