<p>Special thanks to <a href="http://softwareplusplus.com">Cory Berg at Software++</a> and to <a href="http://carlkingdom.com">Carl King Creative</a> for sponsoring this interview.</p>

<p>Cory is a software development and management expert who’s written a fantastic book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Software-Must-Have-Skills-Engineers-ebook/dp/B00U4ZRQC6">Software++: Must-Have Skills for Engineers</a>. There are a lot of software people I’ve met via Make Weird Music and Guitar Circle.</p>

<p>Carl is an expert filmmaker, author, and <a href="/discover/carl-king">former musician</a>. His book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Youre-Creative-Genius-Now-What/dp/1932907920">So, You’re a Creative Genius… Now What?</a>, has been a huge inspiration for me and many others. He filmed this interview and provided lots of great equipment and expertise.</p>

<h2 id="a-little-about-steve-vai">A Little About Steve Vai</h2>

<p>Steve Vai is a forward-thinking, virtuosic guitarist based in Los Angeles. He started his career in music with <a href="/discover/frank-zappa">Frank Zappa</a> in 1979.</p>

<h2 id="whats-so-weird">What’s So Weird?</h2>

<p>A lot of Steve’s work makes use of the following weird music techniques:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Time Signatures</li>
  <li>Composition</li>
  <li>Virtuosity</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-i-care">Why I Care</h2>

<p>In 1996, I heard an instrumental guitar song on the radio (!!) that had the most incredible guitar playing I’d ever heard. It opened my eyes to new potential on the instrument and I had no idea that level of technicality, virtuosity, and musicality. The DJ said, “That was Steve Vai with his track <em>Juice</em> off his new album, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_Love_Secrets">Alien Love Secrets</a></em>.” Immediately, I scrounged up all the cash and change I could, went to Best Buy (when they actually had a good selection of music for sale), and bought it for $9.99.</p>

<p>Little did I know, Steve Vai was–and still is–one of the most innovative, inspired, and ambitious guitarists in the industry. <a href="/discover/frank-zappa">Frank Zappa</a> credited him with “impossible guitar parts” as the “stunt guitarist” of his band between 1980 and 1982. Between solo releases, he played with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcatrazz">Alcatrazz</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lydon">John Lydon/Johnny Rotten</a>’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Image_Ltd">Public Image Ltd.</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lee_Roth">David Lee Roth</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Cooper">Alice Cooper</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitesnake">Whitesnake</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozzy_Osbourne">Ozzy Osbourne</a>.</p>

<p>His solo releases through the 1990s were mind-blowing. <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passion_and_Warfare">Passion and Warfare</a></em>, <em>Alien Love Secrets</em>, and <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Garden">Fire Garden</a></em> were in my CD player for months. I bought every used guitar magazine and tablature book I could find to learn those songs. There are enough weird music techniques in these albums for decades of worthwhile study.</p>

<p>Through Steve’s music (especially sheet music), I learned an incredible amount about time signatures, composition, instrumentation, key modulations, humor, crossing multiple genres, experimentation, and virtuosity. He’s been a huge inspiration to my own guitar and composition techniques.</p>

<p>Steve Vai has had a long, incredible history of trailblazing in the instrumental rock genre and he shows no sign of stopping. Every album features intricately planned and executed melodic explorations, rapid-fire blues-based riffage, and new sounds like you’ve never heard out of a guitar. His discography covers all sorts of ground from straightforward blues/rock to completely whacked-out alien noise.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-should-hear-first">What You Should Hear First</h2>

<p>If you’ve never listened to Steve, here’s where to start:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For groundbreaking guitar rock: <em>Passion and Warfare</em></li>
  <li>For completely weird, Zappa-esque outlandishness: <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flex-Able">Flex-Able</a></em></li>
  <li>For compositional complexity: <em>Fire Garden</em></li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re looking for an album with one genre/version of Steve, you’re not going to find it. He sticks to no particular genre and offers something for everyone. My favorite pieces of his are the extended-length exploratory pieces, like <em>Freak Show Excess</em>, <em>Fire Garden Suite</em>, <em>The Story of Light</em>, and <em>Lucky Charms</em>.</p>

<p>And if you’re looking for something REALLY out there, check out his performance of <em>Fire Strings</em> with the Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra.</p>
