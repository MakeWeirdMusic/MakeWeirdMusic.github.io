<p><a href="/discover/panzerballett">Panzerballett</a>’s new album, <em>X-mas Death Jazz</em> is easily one of my favorite albums of 2017 and probably my favorite Panzerballett album. The musicality is extraordinary, the guest musicians are wonderful, and the complexity is more meaningful than ever. <a href="/interview/jan-zehrfeld">Jan Zehrfeld</a> and crew have completely outdone themselves. Again. There is no other band like this on earth. There is no other album that sounds like this. You truly need to buy it.</p>

<p>I am beyond happy to be a mutual connection with these fantastic musicians and to have had the opportunity to film all these interviews around the world to make it happen. It’s been months in the making and it’s finally here (though, a few days later than I’d hoped, but that’s fine).</p>

<p>This interview features Jan Zehrfeld (the mastermind behind Panzerballett), Jen Majura (<a href="/share/jen-majura/inzenity">we just interviewed her for her new album, <em>InZENity</em></a>, which came out on the same day as <em>X-mas Death Jazz</em>), <a href="/interview/mattias-eklundh">Mattias IA Eklundh</a>, and <a href="/interview/mike-keneally">Mike Keneally</a>, plus a generous helping of song samples from the record to entice you. It’s four interviews plus music smashed into one 42-minute video. I really hope you enjoy it!</p>

<h2 id="interview-transcript">Interview Transcript</h2>

<p>[Introductory clip of <em>For Whom the Jingle Bells Toll</em> from Panzerballett’s <em>X-mas Death Jazz</em>]</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: This is Anthony with MakeWeirdMusic.com and I am here with Jan Zehrfeld from Panzerballett and they–well, Jan has a new album with Panzerballett. It’s a Christmas album and I thought it’d be cool for him to talk about why a Christmas album and about some of the guest artists on the album. So, why Christmas music? And what’d you do with it? [Laughs.]</p>

<p class="interviewee">JZ: Well, Christmas music–it started in 2003. I got a new computer, I started recording guitars and I started recording just for fun Christmas songs for my friends and contacts. And it was nothing special yet. It was just three voices of guitar, some Brian May-style thing and it got good responses. So I chose to do another one a year after. But then I was playing in a speed metal band at the time and I thought, “Well, what about mixing speed metal with Christmas songs?” I wrote just a 20-second thing and it was a whole lot of fun. After that, a year after again, I did something–this was <em>Jingle Bells</em> and this was already in the Panzerballett style. It got like–it was even better–it got tradition. For 13 years, I’ve been doing these 1-minute Christmas greetings.</p>

<p>[Christmas greeting examples: <em>Let it Snow</em>, <em>White Christmas</em>, <em>Rudolf the Red-Nosed Reindeer</em>, <em>Es Kommt Bald</em>]</p>

<p class="interviewee">JZ: After a couple of years, some of the prog stations started airing them and people were looking and asking me, “What’s your next Christmas song?” It was always big fun and why I chose to go on. It was because I feel that’s my actual feeling about the Christmas time. I feel not very calm and peaceful. <span class="important">The message that I get from the Christmas time is a different one. It just reflects my inner world better to channel aggression</span>, channel the aggression in the traffic that happens, to channel aggression in the shopping malls, and everything. Everyone needs a present. It has to be.</p>

<p class="interviewee"><span class="important">It’s like forced joy, forced cheer from this forced happiness.</span> I don’t like it. It just makes me angry and I think it’s like–I like the contrast. The reason why I make music is to channel aggression. One of the main reasons. <span class="important">And all the ingredients I use for making this music are like the absolute opposite of the ingredients that are used in Christmas music.</span> I think this contrast is very exciting and fun to do.</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: You’ve got some special guests on the album.</p>

<p class="interviewee">JZ: Yeah.</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: Who’d you find and why’d you bring them aboard?</p>

<p class="interviewee">JZ: So, first and foremost of all, Mattias IA Eklundh from Jütebog. The crazy Swede, freak.</p>

<p class="interviewee">IA: I sing a very strange, hedonistic pagan version of <em>White Christmas</em> and <em>Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer</em>. To this very day, Rudolph is scaring the shit out of me.</p>

<p>[Clip of <em>Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer</em>]</p>

<p class="interviewee">IA: Because Jan Zehrfeld is a mad-scientist, he sent me this beefy score with sort of the melody, but since he’s been to school and he learned many adult chords with numbers and stuff, the harmonies were so–can I say “fucked up?”</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: Yes.</p>

<p class="interviewee">IA: It was, “No no no. This is impossible.” <span class="important">It was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done.</span> I’m trying to convince him to make a very strange video. Maybe we’ll do it naked. Because it’s really spooky. It’s not the Rudolph you’re used to. It’s really weird. Really weird. Make weird music. Well, that’s Jan Zehrfeld for you. [Laughs.]</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: Did you do the–did you scream “Rudolph” in the background?</p>

<p>[Clip of <em>Rudolph</em> screams.]</p>

<p class="interviewee">IA: I am screaming.</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: You’re screaming all that.</p>

<p class="interviewee">IA: It’s kind of fun because I live in the Swedish woods, as you know, and there are not many people here. Occasional mooses and a few birds and I have my big dogs, but I have a great neighbor not super-far and he was up in the middle of the night working with his car and I was late, as I–I’m always late when it comes guest appearances. I wait until the very last minute. And he would hear me. We talked the other day. “Are you okay? Because around 1, 2-ish, I could hear you scream ‘Rudolph!’ and ‘Red-nosed!’ What was going on? Complete silence and then outburst of just insanity!”</p>

<p class="interviewee">So, that was kind of fun. I said, “Yeah, I was working on a Christmas album with some German friends, you know. We needed that screaming, Rudolph screaming.” But it’s not every day you scream, “Red-nosed.” You know, blood is coming out of your mouth and red… I think I have the score somewhere. Give me a second.</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: Okay.</p>

<p class="interviewee">IA: Oh yeah, yeah, so here is–do you see this?</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: I see a little bit, yeah.</p>

<p class="interviewee">IA: Yeah. This is the vocal part of <em>Rudolph</em> and [laughs] this is not kid’s stuff.</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: Jan sent me some early mixes and every time I listen to <em>Rudolph</em>, I laugh so hard just at those screams in the background. It’s so passionate.</p>

<p class="interviewee">IA: Yes! I love Christmas music. I really do!</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: Oh, do you?</p>

<p class="interviewee">IA: I adore it! I love Christmas as well. I always take December completely off and I have a little glass of fine cognac and I listen to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Martin">Dean Martin <i class="non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> and I decorate the Christmas tree. I decorate the Christmas tree. I have a 10-year-old. He can put up the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Simmons">Gene Simmons <i class="non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> decoration and stuff like that. My wife doesn’t touch it. It takes me forever. I light a fire in our lovely living room and I listen to Dean and I really work it, you know? I’m super-picky. It’s insane. I don’t know. There are a few things I wonder about myself: why do I like decorating the Christmas tree and why do I like playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(2016_video_game)">DOOM <i class="non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> so much? It’s weird. 10 years of therapy could maybe…</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: You are also contributing guitar, right?</p>

<p class="interviewee">IA: I am. Yes.</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: On which song?</p>

<p class="interviewee">IA: Both. I sing both <em>White Christmas</em> and <em>Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer</em> and I also do some lead work. They cut all–I think there are three solos in White Christmas. For the video, they wanted to make it “commercial,” so they took that out, but on the album, there’s a lot of weedly-weedly. And again, it’s over adult chords, so I had to get my shit together. Every time you play with Panzerballett, you have to take a deep breath and read music and–”ARGH! What is this? What’s this harmony?” And so on. I love them. I think they’re really really really wonderful. They are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_Jones">Spike Jones <i class="non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> of this century, in a way. <span class="important">It’s musical murder.</span></p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: Yeah. And Jen said it was some of the hardest music she’s ever tried to record. I actually spent some time with Jan this summer and he was having a hard time playing through it, so that was actually comforting.</p>

<p class="interviewee">IA: I saw the video. I saw the video that you edited together. I laughed.</p>

<div class="video-wrapper"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dNE8DIRk7TA?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

<p class="interviewee">IA: I laughed to tears because he’s–again, he’s a mad professor. He’s just hilarious. Everything he says, even if he doesn’t mean to be super-funny, he’s just very very funny. You know? So, I love those outtakes. It really made my day. It was such a funny video.</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: Awesome. So, what are some of your favorite moments of what you recorded on this and what do you think people are going to get out of it?</p>

<p class="interviewee">IA: Oh, that’s a tricky question. I think they will like it. When I did <em>White Christmas,</em> that was the first one I recorded the vocals…</p>

<p>[White Christmas clip]</p>

<p class="interviewee">IA: <span class="important">I tried to be funny. It was not funny. I tried to overdo it. And then I said, “Well, I actually like this music. I like Christmas music. Sing it in the most honest way you can.”</span> I really tried to be a heavy metal crooner kind of guy and then it clicked. Then it worked. So, it’s funny stuff, but it’s also dead serious in many ways. You do not kid around. “Where is 1?” I tried to find the “da.” It’s really, really hard so I slapped my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konnakol">Indian Konnakol <i class="non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> to say, “Where am I in this fucking music?” <span class="important">You have to do it and you have to play it like you mean it and then it becomes funny.</span> Don’t joke around because then it’s turning out stupid, I think. I love doing it. I was always late and I sent it off to Jan and said, “I don’t know if this is just utter crap or if it’s good.” He loved it. He’s such a gentle guy.</p>

<div class="video-wrapper"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GvKFCGqdNeM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

<p class="interviewee">JZ: Who’s already been a guest on <em>Tank Goodness</em> and I’ve been in touch with him since 2010 when he once wrote me on MySpace that they were touring with <a href="kipedia.org/wiki/Freak_Kitchen">Freak Kitchen <i class="non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> and <span class="important">they had to stop the touring bus because they had to laugh about a Panzerballett song</span>, what was happening in there. So, yeah, we met at <a href="kipedia.org/wiki/Musikmesse_Frankfurt">Musikmesse <i class="non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> and we got friends and said, “Let’s do something together.” Then we started exchanging ideas and writing together. So I thought, “Well, Mattias would be really great to have on this Christmas album again.” He even does two songs with his awesome guitar soloing. It’s just the right thing. He–</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: And his vocals. He sings.</p>

<p class="interviewee">JZ: Yeah, his vocals. Mattias told me he loves Christmas and not everyone does that. I cannot say I love it or I hate it, I just have my feelings about the Christmas time. The idea of Christmas, of course, is great, but it’s just hard to make it as it should be, actually. I requested some other guests who declined because they said, well, they hate Christmas. I guess they just didn’t listen to the music because if you hate Christmas, it’s also an album for you.</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: The anti-Christmas Christmas album.</p>

<p class="interviewee">JZ: Right. So, Mattias–we have Mattias. And then we have Jen Majura.</p>

<div class="video-wrapper"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B3i6bcFhVXI?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

<p class="interviewer">AG: So, yeah, you play on and sing–wait, you sing on it.</p>

<p class="interviewee">JM: I sing on it.</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: You sing.</p>

<p class="interviewee">JM: Yeah. It happened after I asked Jan to contribute to my album. He was like, “Oh yeah, let’s do this together. I’ll do a solo for your album,” and “I’ll do some vocals for your album.”</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: You have an awesome voice.</p>

<p class="interviewee">JM: Thank you.</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: You’re a great singer.</p>

<p class="interviewee">JM: Thank you.</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: Seriously.</p>

<p class="interviewee">JM: It was a lot of fun, absolutely. I think it [laughs] <span class="important">it’s been the most insane experience I’ve ever had in a studio.</span></p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: Yeah!</p>

<p class="interviewee">JM: Because if you work with a guy like Jan from Panzerballett–</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: Yes [laughs].</p>

<p class="interviewee">JM: It’s kind of scary, to be honest. It’s scary because I consider him to be a genius in music and I have–not only is he a good friend, but he’s just so good in what he’s doing that I felt like, “Oh, will I survive this?” So, I asked him for a printed sheet so I could actually just read what’s going on because, of course, you can listen to it and try to reproduce it but with that amount of information, I was kind of like, “Give me a printed sheet so I can read notes.” Then I looked at the notes and I was like, “Good Lord! It’s like 11/16 followed by 13/8,” and <span class="important">I was like, “Oh shit! How am I going to do this?”</span></p>

<p class="interviewee">And then I did a take and his comment–he was quiet. And I said, “Jan? Jan?” And his comment was, “Well, could you do the second triplet in the 16th again, a little bit more staccato?” And I was like, “Dammit, I’m so happy I just made it through the whole thing. Okay, let’s do it again and do it again.” It was really fun. It was fun to work with him.</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: It’s funny. He had that <em>Typewriter II</em> cover thing a long time ago and I did a cover.</p>

<div class="video-wrapper"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HRdk3HoknWk?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

<p class="interviewee">JM: I saw it. I saw it.</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: Well thank you.</p>

<p class="interviewee">JM: It’s awesome! I saw it. I told you, I love it.</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: Thank you! So, I did this cover and I was like–I was really happy about it, and then I saw the winners of the contest and I was like, “Oh yeah. German precision.” Jan is like–I’m very loose, I played my thing, but I realized watching the winners, I was like, “I see why they won!” It’s a very tight cover and Jan is very precise.</p>

<p class="interviewee">JM: Yes, especially when it comes to timing, note lengths… It’s good. That’s why he’s able to keep that band tied together because he’s got that special ear for tightness and timing. It’s been interesting working with him, definitely.</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: Yeah, I mean, what a privilege too.</p>

<p class="interviewee">JM: I was honored.</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: I’m sure it took you up a couple notches in what you need to do perform it.</p>

<p class="interviewee">JM: Yeah. I just had ants in my pants, to be honest, when I came there. I was like, “Ooohhhh” [nervous noises]. It turned out to be fun. We did it a couple of times and I had my issues and then he went to me and said, “Oh could you try this a little bit more of ‘that’ and a little bit more [screams].” And I said, “Okay. Whatever you want.”</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: Yeah, so what were some of the challenges outside of, obviously, the timing.</p>

<p class="interviewee">JM: The timing was a big–like, the major challenge. The timing. Then–well, he was also when it came to the scored notes and stuff, I suggested, “Maybe we could do this a little bit–like, an octave higher so it won’t get in the way of the main vocals,” because I had just learned in the studio that Mattias was going to sing on that one. I didn’t know that. He just sent me the track and his demo version and I was like, “Okay, that’s cool.” And then when I came to the studio to record, he was like, “Yeah, Mattias is going to sing the main vocals.” “Really?! That is awesome! Us three together on one song. I love that!”</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: Yeah! I love it too. It’s awesome.</p>

<p class="interviewee">JM: He was really cool when it came to talking about the arrangement. Of course, not the major arrangement, but sometimes there were words or phrases that would get in the way with the main vocals of Mattias, so I kind of suggested, “Could we do this an octave higher?” Or, he was kind of inspired and went to me like, “Hey could you try this and do a second line?” We changed some words a little bit. It was very cool working together. I really had a good time. It was interesting to see how Jan was working. I learned a lot that day.</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: And there’s a lot of stacking of what you’re doing.</p>

<p class="interviewee">JM: No not at all.</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: [Laughs.] How many vocal parts did you sing at one time? Three?</p>

<p class="interviewee">JM: I think the most–it sounds massive, but it’s the max of three different lines.</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: It’s really complex.</p>

<p class="interviewee">JM: Yeah, but that is the way Jan wrote the whole thing.</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: I know.</p>

<p class="interviewee">JM: So, it sort of starts odd against the main vocals and in the end, it merges together and ends up in one. That is just a phenomenal way of writing in a timing-wise thing. If you take a look at it, how he thinks about it, how he starts completely different until the whole thing merges together and ends up on the 1. That is really–it was beautiful to see.</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: How did you get connected with him?</p>

<p class="interviewee">JM: I expected you to ask that question. I have no clue.  I thought about it earlier today, but I don’t know. I think I was at the [Freak Guitar camp] in Sweden with Mattias and I think we talked about Jan and then I saw your interview of Mattias when he–I love what he said there. He was like, “Jan is exploring the depths of madness.” I loved that so much, so I think I just wrote him on Facebook.</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: Oh, so it’s recent?</p>

<p class="interviewee">JM: Yeah, it’s like two years? Two or three years? Something like that.</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: Wow. I thought you were old friends or something.</p>

<p class="interviewee">JM: No, we really became close friends since then. It’s nice. We’re in steady contact and everything is cool.</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: Okay, yeah, because he speaks very highly of you.</p>

<p class="interviewee">JM: Thank you Jan. I know you’re going to see this. [Blows a kiss.]</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: Awesome. So, anything else about the recording experience?</p>

<p class="interviewee">JM: After I finished recording <em>White Christmas</em>, I went to have a break and a coffee. I came back to the studio and I remember Jan was in there singing, “We Wish You a Merry Christmas.”</p>

<p>AG: Oh yeah.</p>

<p class="interviewer">[Clip of <em>We Wish You a Merry Christmas</em> from <em>Es Kommt Bald</em>.]</p>

<p class="interviewee">JM: And he was yelling, too! He was like, “AAAGH! I can’t do this! It’s too hard!” And <span class="important">I love when people write music, like musicians write and are challenging themselves to get it out what they hear inside of their ears and inside of their mind.</span> So, Jan apparently wrote something that drove him nuts as well and he was like, “Jen! Come here and sing that! I can’t!” I was like, “Okay!” So I tried it and I was suffering too because it was just so hard to sing.</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: Oh, that’s funny.</p>

<p class="interviewee">JM: It was fun. We really had a great, great, great day in the studio.</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: What about the rest of the album? I know you’ve heard some songs. What do you think?</p>

<p class="interviewee">JM: It’s craziness. It’s like exploring the depths of madness.</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: Absolutely.</p>

<p class="interviewee">JM: I think it’s a beautiful idea to put that Christmas album out there finally. I know it’s been on his mind for quite some time and it’s a great idea. The final result is technically, arrange-wise and musically, from my understanding of music, beautiful. I really like the style of music, the style of Panzerballett in general. They started with the quintuplets and then turned into–well, where are we now? <a href="/learn/tuplets">Seven-tuplets or something</a>?</p>

<div class="video-wrapper"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/91zrIPUJRtg?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

<p class="interviewer">AG: Yeah, they’re starting with nines now.</p>

<p class="interviewee">JM: Are we at nine now?</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: I think he said there’s sevens and possibly some nines on this Christmas album.</p>

<p class="interviewee">JM: Yeah, sure.</p>

<p>[Laughter.]</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: For those twirling their mustache listening to the record.</p>

<p class="interviewee">JZ: She’s a fan of this wacky music and odd music also. She loves it. She’s singing along with Mattias on a song, on <em>White Christmas</em> actually.</p>

<div class="video-wrapper"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l7EYqXkoWts?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

<p class="interviewer">AG: She does an awesome job.</p>

<p class="interviewee">JZ: Yeah, exactly.</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: So great.</p>

<p class="interviewee">JZ: I didn’t even know she was singing. She just one day played something to me and… “Who’s singing?!” “Okay, that’s me doing some background vocals.” And I thought, “Wow, okay. This could be a great fit. Male and female voice.” Mattias and Jen together is like something I thought I could imagine well and fits well.</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: It does.</p>

<p class="interviewee">JZ: Yeah. And then we have <a href="kipedia.org/wiki/Steffen_Kummerer">Steffen Kummerer <i class="non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> of <a href="kipedia.org/wiki/Obscura_(band)">Obscura <i class="non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>, who’s singing on <em>Let It Snow</em>. We needed some real death metal stuff.</p>

<p>[Clip of Steffen’s singing on Let It Snow.]</p>

<p class="interviewee">JZ: Sebastian [Lanser], he’s playing drums for Obscura as well. So I thought, “Well, let’s use this connection for making it even more evil. To express maximum evil with death metal vocals.” And the album is called <em>X-mas Death Jazz</em>.</p>

<p class="interviewer">The death jazz, that’s kind of a running gag. When we started as a band, someone was like–we played a lot of jazz clubs and some of the people who didn’t know us and just walked inside the club, “Hey, Panzerballett. What style of music are you playing?” “Uh, well, we are playing death jazz.” Not death metal. I thought, “This is a nice thing. Christmas death jazz is the right title for this album.” And Steffen brings the death part. And on the same song, we have <a href="/interview/mike-keneally">Mike Keneally</a>, who’s a tremendous awesome musician. When looking for someone, a singer to do this, I was asking myself, <span class="important">“Who could possibly ‘get’ the rhythm and wouldn’t get lost in all the rhythmic terror that we’re doing?”</span></p>

<p class="interviewee">MK: Good description.</p>

<p class="interviewer">JZ: Some unusual rhythms going on there and I couldn’t ask just a regular rock or metal singer to do this. Of course, it’s set to be musician’s music, so it would have to be someone who’s really used to intricate rhythms. I’ve known you as a guitar player before. I just knew from two YouTube videos that you’re actually doing singing as well. So, one I think you played with Zappa and you’re younger than now wearing a hat, I think. And then the “daa doo dak,” something like this. Very fast. And the other one is a video where you play something in the rain, but you played double as fast, which was slowed down again. It was a track a couple of years ago.</p>

<p class="interviewer">MK: Yeah, <em>I’m Raining Here Inside</em>.</p>

<div class="video-wrapper"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sug4hC3Ysb0?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

<p class="interviewee">JZ: Right.</p>

<p class="interviewee">MK: Yeah. You, fortunately, provided such comprehensive materials to work with for the recording. He had instruments playing exactly what the vocal was needing to do. Rhythmically and pitch-wise, so I had the option of listening to these melodies, which is identifiable as the melody from Let It Snow. I love that song, by the way. I love your arrangement, but I’ve always enjoyed the song <em>Let It Snow</em>, and I have a real weakness for Christmas music. I’m a total Christmas geek, but I also like the idea of taking these traditional songs and messing with them almost beyond recognition. But, it’s still identifiably the song even though rhythmically it’s going all over the place. This particular track travels through about 18 stylistic variations.</p>

<p>[Clip of Mike singing on <em>Let It Snow</em>.]</p>

<p class="interviewee">MK: So it’s great. I was able to hear the melodies that he needed me to sing, both in the context of these crazy rhythms and also could make all of that go away because you provided stems so I could just listen to the vocal over the click. So, at that point, or I should say I listened to the vocal melody over the click because it was keyboards playing the vocal melodies that you sent me. So I could just listen to a keyboard playing whatever I needed to sing as it related to the click. That made it very easy because all I had to do was relate it to something very steady and not be distracted by the [rhythmic noises].</p>

<div class="video-wrapper"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HECxB67qBvM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

<p class="interviewer">And it’s like, “Okay, so it’s not a question of how do I sing these quintuplets over this rock groove and make it lock in,” it’s just, “All I have to do is sing it against the click and sing exactly what the keyboard is playing, then bring back all the instrumentation and make sure it lined up with what you were hoping to do.” It was the same way with the harmonies, especially in that <a href="kipedia.org/wiki/The_Andrews_Sisters">Andrews Sisters <i class="non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> section where it’s extremely dense four-part harmony. If there were four of me, in reality, and we were all trying to sing that stuff perfectly, it would be a struggle because it’s four voices seemingly singing a whole tone or a half tone apart in some sections. But, you break it down to one track at a time and just sing exactly what you had the keyboard singing or playing, and then listen to them all together and make sure that the phrasing all lines up nicely.</p>

<p class="interviewee">I was experimenting with different recording situations. I had friends who had studios and stuff because I don’t have home recording right now. So, I was going to different places and the first time I tried it out, I sang that Andrews Sisters section an octave too low, which was extremely dense and then he kindly said, “It sounds very good, but this one section [laughs] should be an octave higher.” I was like, “Okay, that makes sense to me now.” Then I went to <a href="http://www.doubletimerecordingstudio.com/">Double Time <i class="non-mwm far fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>, which was fun to record. That was the studio where I recorded <em>Boil That Dust Speck</em> and <em>Sluggo!</em> and various projects. I haven’t worked with <a href="kipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Forrest">Jeff Forrest <i class="non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>, the engineer there, for quite some time. I worked with him on <a href="kipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Kime">Jamie Kime <i class="non-mwm fab fa-wikipedia-w" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>’s solo record. That’s the last time I worked with Jeff, but I haven’t done any singing with him in a long time. So it was fun to go back there and do vocal tracks there. Kind of nostalgic. It came together pretty quickly. It took me about 2 hours to record all the stuff.</p>

<div class="video-wrapper"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r7VqwdMWDXs?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

<p class="interviewee">JZ: Great.</p>

<p class="interviewee">MK: Jeff really enjoyed it and he’s listening to your arrangement and it’s incredibly intricate and beautifully played and all your stuff is brilliant. And he’s like, “Who is this guy?!” It was fun to introduce you to him via this track. I was like, “Oh I’m going to sing on this Christmas song.” I didn’t tell him what was going on. He was like, “Holy shit! What is this? This is amazing!” I’m very happy to be a part of the track. It’s super high quality and I suspect that the whole album is going to be that way. I’m jazzed to hear the whole thing.</p>

<p class="interviewee">JZ: Yeah! That’s great. I have a question about–for myself, when I arranged it and learned it, at first I’m arranging and then I can learn it and then it takes me some time to really get to nail it down, but the hardest part was this quintuplet part. I think the first version I sent you was with a quintuplet click, but then I remember how I thought the first time when I did the pre-production back in 2012 how I recorded it back then and then I used, actually, the other click, the triplet click.</p>

<p class="interviewee">MK: Yeah.</p>

<p class="interviewee">JZ: Which first just as well to the part, but is way easier to perform to.</p>

<p class="interviewee">MK: Easier to feel. It’s funkier.</p>

<p class="interviewee">JZ: Right! Right.</p>

<p class="interviewee">MK: It’s not as clinical. Yeah, <span class="important">I was able to sort of get in the character of your intention with that different click.</span> When we recorded, I had both of your clicks, so I had them both lined up and I found that there were some sections–I couldn’t tell you precisely which–some sections where it was easier to perform to one click and other sections where it was easier to perform to the other.</p>

<p class="interviewee">JZ: Right.</p>

<p class="interviewee">MK: And then of course having the actual instrumental tracks as reference as well. But, it was very satisfying, especially when I finally executed the Andrews Sisters harmonies correctly and listened to them against–just a capella and just against the click and then with everything in–it’s such a fun arrangement. It’s really good. I think people are going to get a huge kick out of it.</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: Your voice sounded so good on that recording.</p>

<p class="interviewee">MK: I’m glad to hear that because I tried various approaches and I found that the best thing to do was just try to sing it as straight as I could. There’s a couple of moments that are attitudinal, but for the most part, I just wanted to execute this as cleanly as possible and get the point across without trying to play a character. I did consider doing the death growls at the end, but I thought it would be better to hand that off to a specialist. [Laughs.]</p>

<p class="interviewee">JZ: Right. Right. I wasn’t sure in the beginning, but this last part, “Is this Mike’s thing? I think maybe, maybe not.”</p>

<p class="interviewee">MK: I think that’s the right call. Orchestrationally, I think it makes more sense just in terms of the sound of the thing to have somebody who really knows what they’re doing.</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: What I loved about your vocal performance on that song, it’s clearly enthusiastic.</p>

<p class="interviewee">MK: Oh yeah.</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: You sound half your age, too. You sound like you’re 20 years old on it.</p>

<p class="interviewee">MK: That’s interesting and delightful because–and I think some of that might have to do with the setting because I was working again with Jeff, with whom I worked on <em>Hat</em> and <em>Dust Speck</em> 25 years ago.</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: Right.</p>

<p class="interviewee">MK: There is something I think that happened that was a little bit of a time tunnel that brought me back to who I was when I did that stuff.</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: That’s what I thought. It was so reminiscent of your <em>Sluggo!</em> vocals. Your new stuff, I love all of it, but it’s clearly been an evolution. When I heard that, I thought, “Wow, I haven’t heard New Mike like that in quite some time.”</p>

<p class="interviewee">MK: That’s real interesting to hear because I didn’t dare breathe a word of that out loud, but I felt the same way when I heard it back. I said, “I sound more like the way I did in the 90s.” So that was real interesting. So, thanks for bringing that out. [Laughs.]</p>

<p class="interviewee">JZ: I’m very happy to have him on this album. And then we have someone maybe not everyone knows because he’s mostly in Bavaria. He’s singing in the region of Regensburg and Landshut and Bavaria, but he’s a great singer. I was looking for a singer for this German song <em>Leise rieselt der Schnee</em>. Actually I had trouble finding singers. I first thought, “Maybe some celebrity or something.” And everyone declined because they thought it’s something they cannot sing or don’t want to sing it or it takes too long to learn or they just don’t get it. And I thought, “Well, I didn’t know anyone,” so I asked the producer, “Do you know any singer? We need next week we need something.” He said, “Oh yeah, here’s a friend. He’s a great singer. He lives kind of in the next village.” And this was Martin Strasser. He sang really awesome on it. I was just looking for awesome singing. Unfortunately, I didn’t know him before, but there he is and does a great job.</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: Yeah. Definitely.</p>

<p class="interviewee">JZ: Martin Strasser.</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: Cool. So, when does the album come out?</p>

<p class="interviewee">JZ: I think it’s the 24th of November. I’m not 100% sure about the date. It will be November for sure.</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: End of November.</p>

<p class="interviewee">JZ: End of November.</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: All right. Cool. Awesome. And where can people buy the album when it comes out?</p>

<p class="interviewee">JZ: The best thing they could do is to go to the website of Panzerballett, panzerballett.de, and order the album there. It’s the best thing they could do. Or, maybe even better, go to a show and we’re basically playing only Germany. Maybe Switzerland, but only Germany. The very, very best thing they could do is come to the show and buy the album there. The second best thing is go to the website. And then there is plenty of other possibilities to buy it.</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: Awesome. And I want to say if you’re this far in the video. You gotta buy this album. It is so freaking good. Seriously. It’s incredible. It’s a work of art. I enjoy Christmas like Mattias and I enjoy this album. So, it’s an album for everyone. People who hate Christmas. People who love Christmas. People who get stressed out by Christmas.</p>

<p class="interviewee">JZ: And for our fans: I think the whole band, we’ve talked already about it. Probably it’s the best album we’ve–best Panzerballett album.</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: I think it’s the best sounding album, too.</p>

<p class="interviewee">JZ: As well, yeah.</p>

<p class="interviewer">AG: All right. Thanks a lot, Jan. It’s awesome. Can’t wait for this album to come out.</p>

<p class="interviewee">JZ: Thanks, Anthony.</p>
