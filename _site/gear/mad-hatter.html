          <h2 id="mad-hatter-guitar-products">Mad Hatter Guitar Products</h2>

<p>Several years ago, I randomly received an email from <a href="https://twitter.com/robertscovill/following">Robert Scovill</a>, world-famous front of house sound engineer for huge artists like Tom Petty, inviting me to play guitar at a mega-church in Scottsdale, AZ. I was dumbfounded. Turned out he was serious, so I went and played a few times at that church. It was there that I met and played with Ed Heisler, founder of Mad Hatter Guitar Products.</p>

<p>Ed and I didn’t talk for several years until we bumped into each other at a guitar show in Tempe, AZ in 2014 or 2015. And it wasn’t until about 10 minutes into our conversation that we realized we had played together several years prior. I ended up buying one of his electronic upgrade kits for my 1997 Ibanez Jem7vwh.</p>

<p>I had no idea what a difference it would make to get the upgrade kit installed in this guitar. It turns out that Ibanez used (uses?) incredibly cheap, low-end components, even in its high-end guitars. After Ed helped me install the kit in the guitar (it was a tight fit), it sounded amazing.</p>

<p>Since he’s basically a 1-man show and he’s passionate about doing what he does and he’s such a good guy and he cares about weird music, I thought he’d be a great fit on the site. Plus, I’d have to say, with his upgrade kit, I have more flexibility in guitar tone than ever. There are a lot of guitar players that visit the site that’d definitely get a lot out of buying his gear.</p>

<p>I invited Ed into my tiny bedroom studio to talk about Mad Hatter, and talk we did! I learned a lot in this interview and I hope you do, too. We talk about guitar electronics, manufacturing processes, how the electronics work, and more.</p>

<h2 id="interview-transcript">Interview transcript</h2>

<p class="interviewer">Anthony: Hey, this is Anthony with MakeWeirdMusic.com and I’m here with Ed Heisler.</p>

<p class="interviewee">Ed: How you doing, Anthony?</p>

<p class="interviewer">A: I’m all right. Thanks for joining us today.</p>

<p class="interviewee">E: Great to be here.</p>

<p class="interviewer">A: Thank you. Why don’t you tell us about who you are, what you do, and why you’re here?</p>

<p class="interviewee">E: Well, I’m Ed Heisler, AKA “Electric Ed”, with Mad Hatter Guitar Products. We sell products that are basically a whole electronics system for electric guitars. We have a relacement kit upgrade to enhance your tone.</p>

<p class="interviewer">A: Tell us about how it is an upgrade.</p>

<p class="interviewee">E: A lot of what you find in guitars, especially those made in Asia, is very subpar. Even in Mexico, they tend to use cheaper components even though some of the guitars coming out of those countries are great guitars. Some of the best guitars are coming out of Korea, actually, and it’s just amazing. There’s some stuff coming out of China that’s really well made, actually, and in Mexico, the Mexican Strats and Mexican Telecasters. A lot different than when I was a young kid. You’d start with these guitars and the action was 2-3” inches off the neck. They were garbage whereas that’s totally changed today and the quality is much better. But in order for manufacturers to save money, they cut costs wherever they can and one of the places is the electronics. So a lot of people buy these great-playing guitars. They go to the music store and go, “Wow, these play great,” and they say, “Well, if I upgrade the pickups to maybe some DiMarzios or Seymour Duncans, this could be a great sounding guitar, too.” But what they don’t realize is you’re basically putting the pickups into a guitar that plays good, but you’re putting them through potentiometers, output jacks, and switches that are basically garbage because that’s where they’re cutting costs. And if you don’t mind, I have a box called my “Box of Doom.” I pull this stuff out of guitars… This is from a Squier Strat. This is about as cheezy and cheap as it gets.</p>

<p class="interviewer">A: Now what–some people, myself included, wouldn’t be able to look at that and go, “That looks like junk,” versus, “That looks fantastic.” So tell me how to identify junk.</p>

<p class="interviewee">E: The way I can identify it is that pretty much anything coming out of Asia is junk. Anything coming out of China is going to be junk.</p>

<p class="interviewer">A: As far as musical electronics?</p>

<p class="interviewee">E: Yeah. Obviously your iPhone was probably made there, so…</p>

<p class="interviewer">A: Yeah, I was thinking, “There’s probably some variance there.”</p>

<p class="interviewee">E: Yeah, but as far as guitar electronics… What you’ll find is a lot of these–sometimes you’ll notice when you turn it on, you’ll notice the volume’s there, the volume’s there and you roll it down and boom, it’s gone. There’s no graduation of it that you normally would have in a quality pot. The switches and contacts are not that good either. When you feel it, it just feels cheap and doesn’t feel as good. What we use at Mad Hatter is a much better quality product. What we did is basically we–</p>

<p class="interviewer">A: Before you go there, I’m curious… What are these components made of?</p>

<p class="interviewee">E: Oh jeez, just the cheapest stuff they can find. They’re supposed to be carbon, but it’s more or less the quality of it. The quality of how they put it together because they’re so mass-produced. The issue is to make it as quick as possible.</p>

<p class="interviewer">A: What are some of the other side effects of poor quality in terms of sound or even the physical use?</p>

<p class="interviewee">E: Oh, tone. First of all, I think these are 250K [pots]. I’ll measure them and realize that instead of measuring 250K, it might measure 190 or 180K. It might not–It just won’t even be close.</p>

<p class="interviewer">A: So they don’t meet specifications?</p>

<p class="interviewee">E: Not at all. No.</p>

<p class="interviewer">A: The quality assurance is fairly low.</p>

<p class="interviewee">E: There would be no quality assurance. The only thing they’re looking to see is that it works.</p>

<p class="interviewer">A: So you might pick up two of the same guitar, one made right after the other, and they’ll sound very different. One might sound much worse than bad and the other might just sound bad? It’ll never sound great?</p>

<p class="interviewee">E: There’s more to that–that’s pretty much any guitar out there. I’d like to talk about that later–the characterstics of the guitar.</p>

<p class="interviewer">A: Okay, cool. Is that what makes–over time, when your pots start crackling–</p>

<p class="interviewee">E: They get dirty. Yeah, that’s pretty much all pots. Even the pots that we use were designed after the great pots used in guitars in the 1950s. I basically went to CTS Corp and said, “Listen. I want a pot that is basically what you guys were manufacturing in the 1950s that were put into ‘59 plain tops, in the 1960s strats, and 50s strats and stuff.”</p>

<p class="interviewer">A: Just so we can start with the basics, what is a potentiometer and what does it do?</p>

<p class="interviewee">E: Okay, a potentiometer is basically–originally they would call them “rheostats.” What it does is it tapers–we’ll use an audio taper, okay?–As opposed to a linear. In audio, it basically curves off the sound and what you’re doing with an electric guitar on a volume pot is, basically, when you start rolling off the volume, what you’re doing is you’re going from one center wiper of the potentiometer into another one that’s hooked up to ground, and what you’re doing is shorting out the sound. As you slowly roll it down towards ground, basically you’re making it sound more quiet until you’re eventually hearing nothing.</p>

<p class="interviewer">A: So, it’s basically re-routing the signal?</p>

<p class="interviewee">E: Yep.</p>

<p class="interviewer">A: Into a wire that has no effect on your output, other than buzzing (if you don’t have good ground).</p>

<p class="interviewee">E: Yeah, that’s a whole other thing.</p>

<p class="interviewer">A: So when you turn it, is there like two contacts inside?</p>

<p class="interviewee">E: Basically you have a wiper in the center two contacts on each side and that resistance goes back and forth. Basically you’re sweeping from one side to the other side.</p>

<p class="interviewer">A: And that’s for volume. What about tone?</p>

<p class="interviewee">E: What you’re doing there is the same concept, but you’re usually only using two contacts. You can see here, you have a capacitor and different capacitors give you a different dynamic and roll off the tone. Unless you have a resistance here going through the volume pot. The guitars in the 1980s, where they had no tone pot, they tended to be brighter. The reason why is because you didn’t have the tone pot in the circuit, which was going to create a little bit of roll-off just naturally by itself.</p>

<p class="interviewer">A: So when you roll the tone knob all the way down and it sounds mellow, what are you doing electronically?</p>

<p class="interviewee">E: You’re adding this capacity into it and this capacitor is going to roll off those frequencies.</p>

<p class="interviewer">A: Oh, interesting. So when you change the capacitance there, it’s going to change the character of the high end or of the whole signal?</p>

<p class="interviewee">E: The whole signal. Yeah, that’s why with our kits, we design them so you can easily grab different capacitors and try them out and swap them and see what you like. There’s so many characteristics you can find. You can sit there all day having fun. A lot of times, I’ll take a capacitor–well, here I can show you right here. [Picks up a guitar.] See in this guitar here, I’ve added–we have the polymer caps and I’ve added this one here and this one here, what it does is when you roll it off, it doesn’t go as deep as most caps. So it gives you a smaller frequency range, but yet it gives you a greater distance to dial in that frequency, if that makes sense.</p>

<p class="interviewer">A: So you have more granularity and control over those frequencies, so a little turn on another capacitor would be the same as a larger turn on this capacitor?</p>

<p class="interviewee">E: Exactly. You can easily swap them out and that’s how we designed it. Fenders use the orange drop. I had one guitar where I bought some bumble bee-type caps that used to be used in the old Gibsons and I put those on there. Russia makes some great–new old stock Russian ones you can find online. You can find oil-filled ones and then the bumble bees. Sometimes you can spend hundreds of dollars on caps. Some of the old vintage ones, people get serious about it.</p>

<p class="interviewer">A: So the variety of tone you get out of one instrument is pretty significant just by switching out capacitors and switching out your potentiometers?</p>

<p class="interviewee">E: Oh yeah. Sometimes you won’t even really hear it–XXX EDIT–</p>

<p class="interviewer">A: Are these your pots too?</p>

<p class="interviewee">E: Yeah, this is our kit right here. This is our single volume, dual tone kit. Basically what you’d normally use on a Stratocaster.</p>

<p class="interviewer">A: What does a dual tone give you? A lot of guitars I see have one tone knob.</p>

<p class="interviewee">E: Fender used two. What they did was on the original ones they had one for the neck and one for the middle and then the bridge was direct. You’d basically bypass the tone so it was really bright. But what I’ve done here is I’ve used the first tone pot and I’ve tied the bridge pickup on the 250K side of the pot because we have a dual-value pot, which I can go into and discuss. And then I put the neck on the 500K to make it brighter, so you can change the different values.</p>

<p class="interviewer">A: So the whole guitar, all the pickups, you have much more control over how they might sound.</p>

<p class="interviewee">E: Oh yeah.</p>

<p class="interviewer">A: Awesome.</p>

<p class="interviewee">E: Every guitar is different. Every guitar has a characteristic of its own. We were talking earlier about picking up two different guitars that were made in the same place and sound different. I remember when Eric Clapton Blackie came out and I remember they took his Blackie and took it to the Fender Custom Shop and every nick and every little thing–</p>

<p class="interviewer">A: Their relic series–</p>

<p class="interviewee">E: Yeah. They measure the capacity of the amps and the pots and they try to make it exactly identical. I was at a store where they had two of them. They had gotten two of them and I played one and was like, “Wow, this one’s nice.” Then I grabbed the other one and we were looking at it and it was unbelievable how different it sounded. Just, it didn’t ring out as much as the first one did because the wood’s different. Even though the Custom Shop sat there and made sure they had the same resistance on all the pickups and the potentiometers were the same, it still was different.</p>

<p class="interviewer">A: Different trees, different wood densities… Those affect the vibrations of the strings.</p>

<p class="interviewee">E: Yeah. I mean, no two guitars are alike. Just like you and me. I think every guitar has its own characteristic. That’s basically how Mad Hatter started. It was based on that concept.</p>

<p class="interviewer">A: How so?</p>

<p class="interviewee">E: I walked into a music store one day and hanging onto a wall was a Les Paul Standard. A black one with factory gold. It was just, boom, playing it and, “Oh, I gotta have that.” I picked it up and it’s got a little bit of a fatter neck and it played great. But I noticed it wasn’t ringing. Sometimes you pick up a guitar and you just feel a little vibration. I thought, “Man, this plays great, but it’s really not ringing. It plays so nice.” Plus it looked cool. I had to have it, so I saved my money and got it home. First thing I did was upgraded the pots. I pulled the pots out of it and they were Gibson pots and stamped with the Gibson medallion. They claim they’re CTS, but I don’t know. I put it on the meter. The 500K pot was reading about 300, so it was <em>way</em> off. I took them out and put new pots in there and I started putting different caps and pickups and it was just like, “Yeah, maybe not this one.” I tried this type of pickup and it just kept going back and forth trying to find the right tone for that guitar. I was doing it and thinking, “Wouldn’t it be nice–” Every time I did it, I had to pull out my soldering iron, plug it in, wait for it to heat up, unsolder it, solder it back in. It was like, “What a pain! Wouldn’t it be nice if I just had some switches or something?” And that was the first design. I sat down with pencil and paper and etched out what became the solderless tone shaping system. That’s what the routing board was with little switches on it where you could change whether you wanted to go with the 250K or 500K and stuff like that.</p>

<p class="interviewer">A: This is a hobby for you, right?</p>

<p class="interviewee">E: It started out that way! Just like a lot of guitar players, it was just something that started as a hobby and it’s growing into a business.</p>

<p class="interviewer">A: So it started out with pencil and paper and you’re manipulating electronics in this Gibson guitar and then, when did you decide, “I need ot have my own system that is consistent?”</p>

<p class="interviewee">E: About that same time. Yeah and I sat down and just manufactured a board. That was our first generation. Since then, at the end of last year, we decided, “How can we improve on this? How can we make it better?” We looked at what my customer service emails were and stuff and I thought, “Okay.” I kind of did an evaluation and I thought, “You know what? I need to eliminate the board.” That’s when we came up with the terminator system.</p>

<p class="interviewer">A: Oh, okay. I have the system with the board.</p>

<p class="interviewee">E: You have the original solderless tone shaping system. And now we have the terminator system, which is more–if you understand guitar electronics, you’ll look at this system you’ll say, “Oh, I know exactly what to do here.” Now you have total and complete control. You can basically take any schematic online, just google whatever, and you say, “Oh, you know what? I can try that with this.” You can use our schematics that we send out with the product or you can use whatever you find online.</p>

<p class="interviewer">A: And that involves changing capacitance. Do you have different kinds of pots with different values?</p>

<p class="interviewee">E: Let me talk a little about our pot. That was the main thing that I really wanted to make sure, because this is where it all starts. This is where the pickups go to, the switch in here. The switch–let me jump over here a little bit. We use Switchcraft toggle switches and CLR selector switches.</p>

<p class="interviewer">A: CLR is a company? A brand?</p>

<p class="interviewee">E: It’s a company. I didn’t bring any Switchcraft. I’m sorry about that. But that’s the toggle switches you find on Les Pauls. The three way. We use Switchcraft. That’s what Gibson’s been using forever and it’s the best. They’re made here in the United States. This is CLR. These are made over in North Carolina. You see this spring here, that’s how you usually tell. These are the ones that Fender’s been using. Leo started using them in the 1950s. All the American made strats, you’re going to find these in there. And they’re just much better quality. You can tell just by moving it. It just feels much more solid. You’re not going to have an issue. So this is the new Terminator system where we mounted the terminal to the side so on a Strat, your pickup wires would go here. On every component we have dead terminals where you can land–in this case we have two dead terminals so you can land the center tap wires on the pickup. So the pickup wire, you have a signal wire and a ground wire. Typically a two wire. On a humbucker, you have your middle wires for each coil where they come together, where the south poles of each coil come together. And those you call your center tap. A lot of times when people try to turn their humbucker into a single coil, they’re basically dropping at the ground there. So anyways, we have the terminals here where you can land those as well and do mods and stuff like that. This one here is our HSH switch. What this one does is for a guitar with a humbucker, single, humbucker and you go to position 2, you’re going to split the coil of the humbucker with the middle, and then the same thing in position 4. But going back to the pot, I went to CTS and I said, “Look, this is what I want. I need a pot. I want it to be smaller in diameter.” So we went with a 17mm diameter instead of the normal big, fat ones. But, I said, “Internally, I want it to be the same as what you guys were making in the 1950s. A carbon pot. I want it to be a brass bushing, brass end, with the 22 knurled teeth end here, split.” Then what I did was I made the shaft here, the bushing length, 12mm. The reason why I did that was because I wanted to be able to fit comfortably into guitars with pickguards like stratocasters, telecasters, whatever, Ibanezes and stuff, and then guitars with carved tops like Gibsons and stuff like that. And it does. I have yet to find a guitar where this does not fit. The 12mm length can fit in any guitar that’s manufactured today. Then we went with the bushing diameter, we went with 8mm. The reason why is because our target market is upgrade those guitars made overseas and they use an 8mm hole, which is a smart hole. Most of our customers–We don’t want our customers to have to drill out the hole and make it larger if they don’t have to. With this one, you won’t have to do that. And then what we have–although with our yin yang push/pull pots, they are 3/8” so you’d have to make those a little bit bigger. We’ll talk about those in a minute. Then I also wanted dual value. 250K, 500K.</p>

<p class="interviewer">A: Okay, I was wondering why the dual pots over there.</p>

<p class="interviewee">E: I wanted it to be as universal as possible so that way strats that are 250K, Gibsons that are 500K. And then with the new Terminator system we can bridge them together so they’re 750K so they can be even brighter. So we have 3 options now with the pot. We have an exclusive deal with CTS corporation for this pot. We’re the only one that they’ll make this for.</p>

<p class="interviewer">A: Wow. So in the case of my custom 7-string, which has a tone bypass circuit where you turn the tone all the way up and then it effectively shuts off the tone knob, you don’t really need that because 750K should allow everything.</p>

<p class="interviewee">E: Well, 750K would be real bright.</p>

<p class="interviewer">A: Probably as bright as having nothing on it, right?</p>

<p class="interviewee">E: Not quite that bright, but pretty close. Yeah, it still gives you that option to roll it down to where you get that really mellow sound.</p>

<p class="interviewer">A: That’s cool! Are guitar companies picking up on these?</p>

<p class="interviewee">E: We have a few guys that are using our products exclusively. MAP guitars in California. JR Guitars Customs in Montreal, Canada. James up there is a great guy. Some of the builds he’s done are for the Alzheimer’s Association. He loves to give back. He calls me up and says, or send me emails saying, “This is what I wanna do.” Something goofy, off the wall. He’s always thinking outside the box and I love working with him.</p>

<p class="interviewer">A: These are so flexible that any idea he has, you can figure it out.</p>

<p class="interviewee">E: Yeah. We’re doing a double-neck together right now. A telecaster, which is kinda cool.</p>

<p class="interviewer">A: What do these builders think of the electronics?</p>

<p class="interviewee">E: They love them. They’re putting our card on there as a hang tag and letting customers know that it’s a quality product inside.</p>
